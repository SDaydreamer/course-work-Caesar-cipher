China wants to unite its 1.4 billion people through football while also using the sport as "a bridge to work with the rest of the world", according to Chinese Football Association (CFA) Secretary General Liu Yi.In a recent interview with Agence France-Presse, Liu talked of "using football to motivate the whole nation.""Football is a beautiful game to educate the new generation of young Chinese and also to (help) our nation to team up as one and be more cohesive," he said.Like China's success in recent Summer Olympics, Liu called football "another tool to unite a nation and also demonstrate what we can deliver. And football, as I said, is a bridge between China and the rest of the world. Everyone plays football."Expanding on that theme, Liu said: "China is still open. And the development of Chinese football needs help from external stakeholders like the AFC (Asian Football Confederation), FIFA and also other federations as well, and other leagues as well.""We are definitely going to carry on with that kind of partnership, working with all the international governing bodies, brands and stakeholders," he added.China are 76th in the FIFA rankings and their chances of reaching the Qatar 2022 World Cup are in the balance, underlining how far they have to go to reach the top.But speaking in Suzhou, where the Chinese Super League is in a "bubble" to thwart the coronavirus, Liu said that failing to qualify will not deter the country from its long-term goals."To win a spot (in Qatar) means a lot to the Chinese, to the country and also the Chinese football community because that boosts the confidence and gives motivation to every stakeholder and to the football community to contribute more to the development of Chinese football," he said."If we fail, you might have a short-term setback, but the president of the central government understands football and that developing football is a process."Along with building a football infrastructure and overhauling grassroots, school and youth systems, the CSL is a crucial part of the determination to be a superpower in the sport.The league made headlines in recent years when a series of well-known foreign players â along with coaches â arrived on generous contracts and for inflated transfer fees.However, the CFA has since introduced measures such as a salary cap so that the largesse is redirected towards developing young Chinese players."We want to be one of the top leagues in Asia, for sure, which we probably already are, but the benchmark is not supposed to be big spending," said Liu. "It's about sustainability."Liu conceded that Oscar and other overseas stars, such as fellow Brazilians Hulk and Paulinho, have boosted the CSL's profile."But has that (expensive foreigners) helped the development of the local players? That's our question mark," he said.Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman picked up where he left off last season with two goals in a 4-0 home rout of Atletico Madrid on Wednesday as the holders got the defense of their Champions League campaign off to a winning start.Coman, whose header settled last season's Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) just 59 days ago in Lisbon, scored Bayern's opening goal, created their second and claimed their fourth behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena."We played very well, I am very happy with my two goals," Coman told Sky Sports."The winning goal in last season's final is a good motivator, but it's in the past now and we have fresh goals this season." Coman saved his best for last with a superb effort, turning the Atletico defense inside out before firing home on 72 minutes.Goals by midfielders Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso, who produced an unstoppable long-range strike from outside the box, added to Atletico's misery in Munich.The defeat was the joint heaviest Atletico has suffered under Diego Simeone, rivaling the 4-0 drubbing dished out at Dortmund almost exactly two years ago.Real Madrid made an embarrassing start in the Champions League on Wednesday as Shakhtar Donetsk pulled off a shock 3-2 win away to 13-time winners Real Madrid in their Champions League Group B opener on Wednesday, despite the Ukrainian side missing 10 players due to injuries and COVID-19.Strikes from Tete and Manor Solomon, either side of a Raphael Varane own-goal, gave the Ukrainian champions a shock lead at the interval and while Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior pulled goals back, Madrid fell short.Fede Valverde thought he had grabbed an equalizer in injury time but his deflected shot was ruled out after VAR showed Vinicius was offside.La Liga champions Madrid, meanwhile, reflected on a second consecutive home defeat after losing 1-0 at their Alfredo di Stefano stadium to promoted Cadiz on Saturday, further denting their confidence ahead of the 'Classico' at Barcelona in three days' time."In the first half we were not worthy of this competition," said Madrid midfielder Modric."It's obvious we need to improve, we lacked confidence today, especially in the first half, but we have to move on, we can't waste any time regretting what has happened."Coach Zidane had insisted ahead of the game that he was not looking to the trip to Barca's Camp Nou but rested several big names against Shakhtar, choosing not to risk captain Sergio Ramos and starting without Toni Kroos and attacking talisman Karim Benzema."I think Madrid underestimated us but we showed our football and our style," said Shakhtar's Korniienko.Romelu Lukaku scored twice, including a last-gasp equalizer, to rescue a 2-2 draw for Inter Milan in their Champions League opener against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday.Lukaku put Inter ahead after 49 minutes in the San Siro only for the Bundesliga club to hit back with a 63rd-minute Ramy Bensebaini penalty and a Jonas Hofmann strike six minutes from time.But Lukaku had the last word sending the ball in from close range in the final minute.Manchester City came from behind to make a winning start in Champions League Group C on Wednesday with a 3-1 victory over Porto at the Etihad Stadium."If I'm being honest, we are struggling at the moment," said City's German midfielder Gundogan."Fernandinho went off at the end, we have players playing in different positions. I am not 100 percent there because I had Covid, we are not all at the same moment."That is the challenge for this season, it's not going to end for a while," he added.Liverpool proved they can cope without Virgil van Dijk as Nicolas Tagliafico's own goal sealed a 1-0 win at Ajax in the opening game of their Champions League campaign on Wednesday (October 21).Critics have claimed Liverpool will struggle without Van Dijk, but Brazilian midfielder Fabinho filled in impressively alongside Joe Gomez at the heart of the defense."It was a good enough performance to win the game, which at moments was pretty wild. It was not one of our sunny shiny world class football days. It was not perfect but the boys fought like crazy," said a more satisfied Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp afterwards.(With input from agencies)Australia's Adam Scott, the winner of 14 PGA Tour titles, withdrew from the U.S. PGA Zozo Championship on Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19. The 40-year-old from Adelaide was going to make his first start since sharing 38th at last month's U.S. Open. Instead, he will begin a self-isolation period under health and safety protocols. Scott will be hoping to get well in time to compete at the Masters, which was moved to November 12-15 in this year's coronavirus-disrupted schedule. Scott, ranked 15th, took his most recent U.S. PGA triumph in February at Riviera. American Jim Herman, the first alternate, replaced Scott in the Zozo field, which tees off Thursday in the opening round at Sherwood Country Club. Also missing from the Zozo field is world No. 1 Dustin Johnson, who tested positive for COVID-19 before last week's CJ Cup at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. Johnson, still feeling low on energy, plans to play next at the Houston Open the week before the Masters. Since the PGA Tour restarted in mid-June following a COVID-forced shutdown, officials have made several attempts to bring back fans but each time they aborted efforts over health and safety concerns. The next two events on the PGA Tour schedule, the Bermuda Championship and Houston Open, plan to allow a limited number of fans. (With input from agencies)Manchester United posted a 23-million-pound ($30 million) loss for the financial year to June 30 as revenues fell due to the coronavirus pandemic and a lack of Champions League football. The fresh spike in COVID-19 cases across Europe is likely to further delay the return of supporters, hurting income from matchday ticket and catering sales, as well as museum tours for the bigger clubs. "Our top priority is to get fans back into the stadium safely and as soon as possible," said United Executive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward. Premier League clubs last week rejected plans put forward by Liverpool and Manchester United for radical changes to the English game's structure and finances and said they would conduct their own review. The Red Devils' wage bill fell by nearly 50 million pounds because player wages fell after the club failed to qualify for the Champions League and because high earners such as Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku were offloaded.United, who have made a mixed start to the new English Premier League season on the pitch, said revenue in the year ended June 30 fell by 19 percent to 509 million pounds, with some fixtures being delayed beyond that date. It gave no financial forecast for the current year.Meanwhile, net debt rose by 10 percent to 474.1 million pounds at the end of June compared with the end of March.The 20-time English champions said the impact of the coronavirus crisis on revenue has been partially offset by lower matchday costs and reduced travel due to the three-month suspension of matches from March to June. (With input from agencies)The virtual World Press Briefing (WPB) for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games kicked off on Monday.The four-day conference, held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has attracted over 400 representatives to tune in including those from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), National Paralympic Committees (NPCs), International Federations (IFs), and worldwide media, among other organizations.Organized by the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee (BOCOG), the online press briefing is an opportunity for stakeholders to familiarize themselves with the ongoing preparations leading up to the Games. Taking into considerations the inability to carry out on-site tours, the conference will take advantage of simulation technology to present the construction and progress, spatial layout, and vehicles and personnel flow designs of the venues. Fifteen functional areas including media operations, venue constructions, registrations, accommodations, transport as well as securities will be touched upon. "Quality services for media organizations are an integral part of our work. We give high priority to media operations and will honor our bid commitments. We have done and will continue to do everything necessary to meet the pre-Games and Games-time needs of the media for Games coverage," Zhang Jiandong, executive vice president of the BOCOG said in his address.Zhang went on to express confidence in Beijing's smooth preparations for the Games despite the challenges brought by the coronavirus and vowed to provide "comprehensive, efficient and convenient" media services.This world press briefing is the first under the watch of Lucia de Montanarella, who was named IOC Media Operations chief in January."I think that the commitment of Beijing 2022 trying to deliver high standard services and facilities to the media is testified by the table that we see, with the top management of BOCOG participating at the opening of this world press briefing," Montanarella said during her opening remarks."It means a lot to the worldwide media to know that BOCOG gives the interests of the media such a high priority in their organization."(Cover image: Beijing 2022 World Press Briefing is held online in Beijing to brief the stakeholders worldwide about the ongoing preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics, Beijing, October 19, 2020. /Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee)(With input from Xinhua news agency)On Chinese social media platforms, video uploaders usually would like to give the title "Foreigners are less series" to some parkour footages. That reflects few of the netizens know there is also a group of people in China playing parkour, and this sport could be aesthetic but not only thrilling.Mucun, born in the 90s in Chongqing, southwest China, is a full-time extreme sports filmmaker, mainly shooting parkour films. Through his works, people could see many aspects of Chinese parkour.During the college stage, Mucun's major had no relation to sports, but he's interested in street dance and other pop cultures. Once for adding a weapon to his breaking dance arsenal, he went to kungfu society to learn somersault, but then, he was attracted by the alumnus who were also playing parkour there.Having an introverted nature, Mucun just did parkour exercise silently and gradually got in touch with China's core parkour athletes in the following years. At the same time, he started to record the playing and tried to make it better.Putting a sports camera on an athlete's body is a general method of taking parkour shots, but that will easily make the audience dizzy. Thus, an eligible parkour cameraman should know about both â how to play parkour and how to get clear images.Sometimes, shooting parkour film could be, to a certain degree, much tiring than just playing it, as the videographer has to run nearly the same route for many times while controlling the camera, paying attention to terrain, machine, and passengers at the same time.But for Mucun personally, the hardest thing is to communicate with athletes, as most of them have formal jobs, parkour is only their hobby, and it's difficult to organize a project with everyone's schedule suitable. Furthermore, when the shooting comes into a challenge, he has to decide whether to persuade the athlete to continue or not."I'm not a person who's good at communicating, and for these years, I have experienced a lot of up and downs on it, fortunately now, I have some faithful friends to cooperate with," Mucun said.As there's rare full-time parkour filmmakers in China, Mucun plays the roles of producer, director, cinematographer, video editor, and special effects maker in most of his projects, and the loneliness makes his career develop slow.While working alone, it still has benefit as he learns many operations of diverse camera equipment during the process. Now, the main types of his work are pure parkour skill show, documentary, and parkour action movie. Besides, he also did some vlogs and films of other extreme sports.To improve his shooting quality, Mucun now attends professional roller skating class regularly. Even though he has quite flexible work, he often gets up at 5:00 a.m. to edit video and arranges his schedule with full activities to 10:00 p.m.Since his first parkour film Super Tramp winning the Banff China Outdoor Film Fest's Best Cinematography Award, Mucun walks on the road of parkour filmmaking more and more confidently.

For Xu Mengtao, a Chinese aerial skier, turning 30 is just a new start to challenge the impossible, to set new records, and to pursue gold and glory at the Winter Olympics.Editor's note: The article is an edited version of an article which was first published on a WeChat official account named Gong Yi Kan Shi Jie. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.Given that some major U.S. media and politicians made groundless claims that the novel coronavirus originates in China, blamed and slandered China, even asked for an apology from China, then I have every reason to ask 10 questions for the United States about its origin too. Better still, unlike the U.S., I did a lot homework and will base my questions on international media coverage of COVID-19.Question 1Since the director of the U.S. Centers of Disease Control, Robert Redfield admitted that some Americans seemingly dying from flu were tested positive for the novel coronavirus, can I conclude that those people actually died from the novel coronavirus? Among the 34 million influenza patients, with a death toll of 20,000, how many were misdiagnosed?When did the misdiagnoses start? And did it actually start from August 2019? These questions are so vital that the world is waiting for an explanation from the United States.Question 2When there were some misdiagnoses admitted by U.S. CDC, I'm scratching my head â isn't the U.S. that owns the best medical technologies in the world? Why did that happen?As the ground glass opacity (white patches) can be easily seen in CT scans of the lungs of patients with the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, it should have been an easy thing to separate the cases of COVID-19 and H1N1 flu. But why were there so many misdiagnoses?Well, that reminds me of the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's request of controlling all messaging regard to the coronavirus. Why does the White House call for messaging control? Does the U.S. need to hide something? Are they plotting some conspiracy?Question 3Why did the U.S. withdraw from the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 2001? Why did it try to prevent a monitoring mechanism for the execution of the Convention? Is it standing in the way of developing biological weapon for the U.S.?If not, why are there new biological laboratories in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan? Are those labs for biochemical warfare? It's impossible that they are keeping viruses as pets. If the U.S. is aiming at provoking a biochemical war, who would be the first target then? Also, how about the swine flu outbreak in China last year? The odd thing is that it broke out in different places simultaneously instead of breaking out separately. Why were drones used to poison the pigs? Was the U.S. behind all that? I heard that it was the pork speculators. But that theory makes no sense â since the swine flu killed millions of pigs in China during the same period of time, pork speculators would suffer great loss instead of profits.The best possible answer to that was foreign meddling. I was among those who wondered if the U.S. had anything to do with that and hoped for an explanation.Question 4The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, located on Fort Detrick, Maryland, was shut down in July 2019. Was it because there was a virus leakage incident?Just one month later, there was an influenza outbreak across the country. Were those two things related in any way?Were the misdiagnoses simply cooked up to cover up such secrets? Did that also become a motive for the U.S. to shift the blame to other countries by labeling them as the origin of the novel coronavirus?Was that an epic coincidence or a dirty secret in disguise? Why did the U.S. erase huge number of English news reports on the internet covering the shutdown in March 2020? Is there anything to hide, or is there anything to worry about?Question 5At the 7th Military World Games (October 18-27, 2019) held in Wuhan, why did the U.S. team (369 members) win ZERO gold medal? Did that even look like a reasonable record for the world's leading military power? Did your government do it on purpose?Was anyone among the 369 participants ever (mis)diagnosed with influenza? Was it possible they were carriers of the novel coronavirus?The best thing for the U.S. now is to stop burying its head in the sand and give the 369 people PCT tests to see if they are infected.Question 6Why did the U.S. hold Event 201, a global pandemic exercise in October 2019? Why was the CIA deputy director participating it? Is it because the U.S. has foreseen a highly-infectious virus is about to cause a pandemic? One month later, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were detected in China and there was a pandemic three months later. Probably, it's not just a coincidence.Question 7Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran all reported that many of their first COVID-19 confirmed cases had no exposure history with China but showed connection with the United States. How come?Genetic research shows that the type of novel coronavirus found in China belongs to Group C, but Group A and Group B viruses â Group C's parental and grand parental viruses â are both found in the United States. Why? A Japanese patient was diagnosed with influenza in Hawaii but was tested positive for COVID-19 when he returned to Japan. How to explain that?Some COVID-19 cases in the U.S. had no connection with China whatsoever. So where does it come from?Question 8You've got no reason to deny that the 1918 Pandemic originated within your territory. But you let Spain bear the blame for as long as a century. Don't you feel shame on that?History seems to repeat itself. So, is the U.S. playing the trick again and attempting to label the novel coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus"?Question 9The 1918 Pandemic, causing 1 billion infections, with a death toll "estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million... one of the deadliest epidemics in human history," according to wikipedia, was proven originating in the U.S., but the U.S. has never apologized to the world. So far, the origin of the novel coronavirus is still unknown, but the United States is requiring China for an apology, how ridiculous is that! Just to remind the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic killing 300,000 people also originated in the U.S., and also the same for HIV AIDS. So why not confess to the world?Question 10In movies, the U.S. is fond of playing the role of the world savior. The image of Captain America is one of its most popular symbols. However, in reality, in the face of a disaster like COVID-19, where is Captain America?The U.S. is not doing enough to protect its citizens at home or on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It even attempted to make Japan responsible for Americans on Diamond Princess. How does the U.S. have the brass to do all these and accuse China of being irresponsible?While China bought the world valuable time to battle COVID-19, the U.S. accused China of being passive and lacking transparency. Well, when the White House instructed the CDC to stop tallying the people tested for novel coronavirus, did that count as transparency? When the U.S. government advised its people not to wear masks, was it not being passive? Just too many questions call for the U.S.'s explanations.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.)The 7th Military World Games took place in China's Wuhan from October 18 to 27. In this video, people around the world expressed their feelings about this sports feast.It was yet another bittersweet moment for me as I completed my role in covering the 7th Military World Games.I knew nothing about the games and admittedly had not heard of it prior to attending, but now I takeaway with me something more."Friendship through sports" is the motto of the games, and this really shined through in Wuhan, China. I saw it with my own eyes and felt it with my heart how new friends and connections are forged not just between the army of different countries but also within a country.The military games is, after all, a multi-sport event â 27 sports, in fact. A military Olympics indeed it was. It's the scale of this event and the sense of a "big family" that differentiates it from other individual sports games, many athletes told me.A few things stood out to me in my reporting.First, many of the international athletes I've spoken to have competed worldwide, but it's their very first time in China. So, it was nice to hear what they think and have to say about the country.Second, many of the athletes have their own lives and jobs outside of the military.Cecilia Sjoeholm from Sweden is one of them. She works as a part-time chef in the Swedish Armed Forces."It has given me friendship, and that's the most important thing. I would not have done it for 10 years if it wasn't for my Swedish friends, people I love, and my friends in the naval pentathlon team from around the world. They're friends forever, and that's why it makes this sport so special," she told me.I've seen how the females compete in the naval pentathlon, and boy, it isn't easy. It features five events: an obstacle course, life-saving swimming, utility swimming, seamanship, and an amphibious cross-country race."The core skill in naval pentathlon is the physical strength, the mental stability which is very needed out in the sea when it could be very cold, rainy, you're wet and tired,"  Swedish team captain Joakim Hiertner said.Another naval pentathlon athlete from Poland, Edyta Korczak told me,  "It makes me feel like I have another family. I can compete with them, but we can be best friends. This is the best thing about sports."Military capabilities and sports skills aside, it's also about the way different countries approach the sport.It may be 23-year old Bianca Caruso's first time in China, but she has competed worldwide and with the Chinese for a couple of years now."I think Chinese are really humble sailors. They are really quiet, always focused on what they are doing. I think what we can learn from them is for sure because we Italians are... kind of jokers," she told me.Likewise, Hu Rong from the sailing competition management committee said there is much that the Chinese can learn from international athletes."It's like their love for the sport comes from within, and they do things with feeling. When they align their boats, the 470s, they do it with attention to detail," Hu Rong said. "We Chinese can also learn how to just simply enjoy the process of competing from the international athletes that and their flexibility in changing roles on the boat."Truly, many life lessons can be gained from sports. For example, I learned from Hu Rong that with sailing the most important skill required is adaptability."This is the number one thing I teach my students because when you have the ability to adapt well, you can change your techniques to navigate different environments. In sailing, adaptability can make up for what you lack in physical strength," she said.Meanwhile, a sport you might not have linked to military sports is golf. Hence, the reason I pitched this story.Nicolas Calvet, a golfer from France, told me that golf has many worthwhile life lessons that can be applied to in one's life and job."Golf has given me a lot, personally and in the job because it teaches you to be really humble and to be honest with yourself," Calvet said. "If you make a mistake, it's nobody's fault but yours. And in the military role, if you can't just look at yourself and say that's me; I'm this, and I have this; you can't go anywhere."I am not sure, but I don't think many other sports allow you to spend over 4-5 hours competing with your small group of teammates.As Arjan De Haas from the Netherlands said, "You can talk about their family, about their homes, what they do at home. We're all in the army, but we're in different parts of the army. So, it's nice to talk about it."As the Games come to a close, I think it's important to take a step back and ponder why is there a need to gather military personnel on the field of sports?According to Major Jan-Henrik Baeck, a board member of the International Sports Military Council (CISM), the most important thing for soldiers to have a platform to meet is that they set up new networks."You set up new connections with other people that you have not reached before," Baeck said."For instance, when I go to a competition, I meet some people from China and Korea, and two years later, I'm in an international mission, and I reach my same buddies that I've reached before, and we are on speaking terms directly. So, this is one of the best things with this community."Now, how can I end this piece without mentioning the Athletes' Village! A place where I called my second home in the past two weeks.To be sure, I don't live there, but almost 10-thousand athletes, coaches and officials from over 100 countries did.It was pretty embarrassing that people I met who saw me at some of the games said to me at the village, "Hey Lynn how are your interviews going?" and proceeded to ask others around us if I have interviewed them yet. Well, I call it devotion to the job!My respect for sportsmen and women just went up a notch. Sports can truly shape a person's life for the better as many athletes have told me, and can bring about friendship and camaraderie on and beyond the field.I may not be a professional athlete who travels around the world, but I have my job where I can explore and bring these stories to all of you.And this alone is enough for me. I had a great time covering the 7th Military World Games and I have, along the way, gained many friends globally and learned from their stories.Also, I'm not sure if this already exists, but wouldn't it be nice to have a Journalist World Games perhaps? Gathering journalists of the world in the field of sports? Every profession needs an outlet to let loose and showcase one's talent and passion, after all.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), signed an order on Monday to reward the Chinese athletes and coaches that participated in the 7th Military World Games in Wuhan, central China.Xi pointed out that the Chinese athletes and coaches, as representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force, had fought all out in the competition, sharing friendship and safeguarding peace while vying for sporting achievements and pursuing sportsmanship. Their performances have won honors for the country as well as for the PLA.Xi emphasized that the historic breakthrough by the Chinese delegation in the 7th Military World Games was achieved with the PLA Sports Delegation keeping the instructions of the CMC in their mind and with the goal of "first-class competition and first-class performances."The order called for the Chinese athletes and coaches to cherish the honor without being arrogant, and to look to achieve greater glories in the future. The order also called on the entire army to learn from the Military World Games' Chinese participants, as well as fighting for the goal of strengthening the PLA while striving to develop a world-class army.The 7th Military World Games, the biggest ever "Olympics for the military," closed on Sunday after 10 days of competition, as hosts China collected 133 golds and 239 medals in total, the first time a country has earned over a 100 gold medals.Held from October 18 to 27, the quadrennial event attracted a record number of participants, with nearly 10,000 officers and soldiers from 109 countries competing in 27 sports.Read more:7th Military World Games closes in ChinaAfter a historic 10 days of competition in Wuhan, central China, the 7th Military World Games wrapped up with an exciting closing ceremony with the theme of friendship. Watch my vlog for a closer look at the special night.It all began on one cloudy day in May 2015 when the central Chinese city of Wuhan dropped a bombshell announcing that it had won the bid to host the 2019 Military World Games â a grand gathering of thousands of soldiers from around the world and second only to the Olympics in terms of scale.There were fears that Wuhan might not be up to the task of staging China's most important international sporting event since 2008. In addition, there were serious concerns over whether there would be a clear social and economic rationale for the event that goes beyond simply hosting a limelight-hogging extravaganza.The unyielding support, cooperation and dedication from all levels of government had raised the hopes of the Wuhan organizers, but a race against time to develop and upgrade the city's infrastructure dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the never-ending construction projects grew louder.Fast forward four years and the tables have turned. The 2019 Military World Games concluded gloriously after bedazzling the world with sporting brilliance, unprecedented geographical reach, unwavering promotion of peace and friendship, and unrivaled spectacle of opening and closing ceremonies.Within a span of 10 days, the highlights flowed thick and fast. Under the motto "Share friendship, build up peace," a record 9,308 military personnel from 109 countries and regions graced the stage in Wuhan in a record 27 events. China achieved its best-ever gold medal haul of 133 on the back of thorough preparations, steely commitment and virtuoso performances. With 67 Olympic and world champions turning out for the jamboree, seven world records were smashed and 85 International Military Sports Commission (CISM) affiliated records were broken. CISM President Herve Piccirillo, who was a living embodiment of jollity and cheerfulness at the closing gala on Sunday, showered praise on Wuhan, saying the hosts "have excellently completed the mission" and the Military World Games will leave the city "unparalleled tangible and intangible heritage for the future generations." It evidently helped that so many locals were extremely zealous about the Games, which were truly omnipresent as special banners and flags found their way into every nook and cranny of Wuhan. It was the first time all competitions for the Games were staged in a single city, and to the pleasant surprise of the organizers, the tickets to a host of events became the hottest commodity in Wuhan. The organizers said more than 600,000 tickets were flying off the shelves. The atmosphere within the 5G-powered venues was second to none. From the intensity of the Naval Pentathlon at Mulan to the thrill of the Parachuting at Hannan and the zest of the Orienteering at Jiangxia, exhilarated crowds packed out almost every venue. For the memorable moments in the Wuhan Sports Center, at the Yishan Golf Club or on East Lake, the buzz stood comparison with any sporting event ever held in China.That's due in no small part to over 250,000 volunteers, who are frequently the unsung heroes when it comes to the crunch. The sense of warmth, intelligence, proficiency and humility they brought to long days of performing ordinary tasks in their eye-catching white-and-green uniforms was noteworthy and highly commendable. Their firm belief that they were part of something bigger rubbed off on the rest of the city.By any measure, Wuhan has delivered on its promise of fostering international cooperation and building peace through sport. As Piccirillo said, "Beyond the Games, it is all the Chinese people who are spreading this message of solidarity and peace."Moreover, the newly-built Athletes' Village, stretching over 565,000 square meters, earned rave reviews and successfully served as a bridge between a swathe of different cultures. Sports fields were noted for some endearing interactions among soldiers who merrily traded lapel pins that were made as mementos of each Games. Wuhan also deserves praise for meticulous attention to detail in planning and obsessive focus on efficiency. The smooth performance of its various transport systems provided more than enough insurance during the fortnight when the huge deluge of visitors descended on the metropolis.One thing Wuhan did exceptionally well was to carry out a roadmap that was underpinned by a responsible fiscal strategy. Instead of hosting the Games as an end in itself, the organizers put top priority on its long-term sustainability. From the very beginning, creating a post-Games legacy was at the heart of their planning.  The major infrastructure of the Games was designed and located with future housing and commercial development in mind. Even the Main Media Center, where all furniture and equipment were on loan from contractors, will be turned into a multipurpose gymnasium featuring an indoor ice rink, a fencing hall and an archery training center.Wuhan is fully capitalizing on the opportunity to leverage the Games to accelerate its extraordinary metamorphosis from an economic backwater into an international hub for business and tourism.There is no doubt that hosting the Games significantly bolstered Wuhan's profile and provided timely momentum for the city to start and finish projects that had been deliberated upon for years, including the world's longest double-deck suspension bridge, Yangsigang Yangtze River Bridge, Asia's largest underground urban complex in Optics Valley Square, and multiple new subway lines that spread out throughout the town.The impressive numbers back up that claim. According to Xinhua, over the past three years, Wuhan renovated 1,300 kilometers of its urban roads and saw its metro network reach 330 kilometers in total length. Meanwhile, a staggering 360,000 trees were planted.With its newfound international recognition, proven ability to stage massive sporting events and enormously positive impact on the Chinese psyche, Wuhan has even been touted as one of the potential candidates to host the 2032 Olympics. As described by Piccirillo, "The multiple venues built in line with highest standards in the world can serve any future international sports event that Wuhan may step up to host."For Wuhan observers and local residents, this rosy picture was far beyond their wildest dreams a decade ago. Basking in the success of the 7th Military World Games, Wuhan has immensely elevated its global status, and the social, economic and cultural impacts of the event will reach far beyond the lifespan of two weeks.Today, Wuhan is no longer in the shadows. The days are gone when the city's majestic Yellow Crane Tower and luscious hot dry noodles were almost unheard of outside China. The world is starting to take notice, and this is exactly the kind of publicity that money can't buy.Wuhan, the capital city of central China's Hubei Province, said goodbye to the 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games, the first international military multi-sport event held in China, with a closing ceremony on Sunday night.Col. Dorah Mamby Koita, Secretary General of the International Military Sports Council, presented the Fair Play Award to Col. Bertrand Gebuhrer, chief of the French delegation during the closing ceremonies of the World Military Games Sunday. The award is presented in recognition of sportsmanship, fair play and contributions to promoting the ideals and values of CISM.The 7th CISM Military World Games concluded in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, on Sunday.Team China, also the largest sports group at the Games, topped the medal table with a total of 133 gold medals, 64 silver medals and 42 bronze medals.CGTN takes you through a brief history of the Chinese delegation in military sports.1951 In September, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) founded its first professional sports team, which included football, basketball, volleyball, track and field, swimming, lifting, gymnastics, and other sports as branches. The name, the August First Team or Bayi in Chinese, is because the PLA was founded on August 1, 1927.1978PLA observers attended the 32nd Congress of the International Military Sports Council (CISM), marking China starting its official military sports ties with the world.1981For the first time, the August First military pentathlon team participated in the 30th World Military Pentathlon Championship, and finished eighth among the 13 participating teams. 1982In December, the PLA founded its military sports team based in one of the competitive sports training centers for soldiers. The team focused on five events: shooting, military pentathlon, horse riding in modern pentathlon, fencing and triathlon (including cycling).2016-2018Institutional reforms that aimed at managing and optimizing sports resources implemented according to the PLA deepening reform plan.Under the newly launched Military Sports Training Center, a total of 29 discipline teams were set up. They included shooting, track and field, swimming, basketball, skiing, military pentathlon, and also added military-focused disciplines such as naval pentathlon, aeronautical pentathlon, and orienteering.Clayton Kershaw, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts â the Los Angeles Dodgers stars all shined.Nothing out of the ordinary there, even if the setting was surreal.Baseball's best team during the pandemic-shortened season showed off its many talents in the first World Series game played at a neutral site, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.With the seats mostly empty, Kershaw dominated for six innings, Bellinger and Betts homered and the Dodgers chased a wild Tyler Glasnow in the fifth inning and coasted home in the opener.A crowd limited by the coronavirus to 11,388 at Globe Life Field, the new $1.2-billion home of the Texas Rangers, marked the smallest for baseball's top event in 111 years.Los Angeles hopes to go home with a title that has eluded the Dodgers since 1988 but tried to guard against focusing ahead."It's hard not to think about winning. It's hard not to think about what that might be like," Kershaw said. "Constantly keep putting that in your brain: tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow. And then you do that three more times, and you can think about it all you want."A regular season star with an erratic postseason history, Kershaw looked like the ace who so often stars on midsummer evenings with the San Gabriel Mountains behind him at Dodger Stadium. With these games shifted, the 32-year-old left-hander wound up pitching not far from his off season home in Dallas.The three-time Cy Young Award winner allowed one run and two hits, struck out eight and walked one. He induced 19 swings and misses among his 78 pitches â more than his three previous Series starts combined."You can appreciate and totally see why he's heading to the Hall of Fame one day whenever he's done," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.Kershaw threw nine balls in the first, when he stranded a pair of runners, then threw just nine more over the next three innings."He had a game plan to try to really quiet down things from there and he executed," said Kevin Kiermaier, who ended Kershaw's streak of 13 retired in a row with a fifth-inning homer on a hanging slider that cut the Rays' deficit to 2-1.Kershaw, a five-time ERA champ, improved to 2-2 in the World Series and 12-12 in postseason play, a shadow of his 175-76 regular season record. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts did not pitch him after Game 4 of the NL Championship Series last Thursday."I think we were going to stay away from him in Game 7 just for this particular reason," Roberts said.Game 2 is Wednesday night. The Dodgers, who posted the best record in the majors during the shortened season and showed off all their stars in Game 1, plan to throw a collection of pitchers started by Tony Gonsolin against Rays ace Blake Snell.Eight of the last 10 teams to win Game 1 went on the title, all except the 2016 Indians and 2017 Dodgers.Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP who began the opener with a career .114 batting average in 12 World Series games, had put the Dodgers ahead in the fourth with a two-run homer off Glasnow, having no trouble driving a 98 mph pitch into the Dodgers bullpen in right-center.Bellinger, whose seventh-inning homer put the Dodgers ahead in Game 7 of the NL Championship on Sunday, shuffled his feet, tapping gently as he crossed the plate and celebrated by toe tapping teammates while dancing back to the dugout, a sign he remembered popping his right shoulder during raucous revelry two nights earlier.He capped his evening by leaping at the 6-foot center field wall in the ninth, robbing Austin Meadows of a possible home run."I said it today before the game: If I hit one I'm not touching anybody's arm," Bellinger said. "I'm going straight foot, and it was pretty funny."Betts, brilliant throughout October but slumping at the plate, added his first postseason homer for the Dodgers, an opposite-field solo shot to right in the sixth off Josh Fleming.Betts had two hits, scored two runs and stole two bases in the four-run fifth, when Corey Seager swiped one as Los Angeles became the first team to steal three bases in a Series inning since the 1912 New York Giants in Game 5 against Boston."That's a weak spot of my game, holding runners," Glasnow said. "Has to be something I focus on more in the future. "Betts became the first to hit a home run, steal two bases and score twice in a Series game."Stolen bases are a thing for me. That's how I create runs and create havoc on the basepaths," he said.Los Angeles is in the Series for the third time in four years but seeking its first title since the Kirk Gibson- and Orel Hershiser-led team of 32 years ago. Coming off an unusual LCS of games on seven straight days, the Dodgers planned an all-bullpen outing for the next game.Tampa Bay was held to six hits. Its only previous Series was a five-game loss to Philadelphia in 2008.Glasnow was chased after 4 1/3 innings with an ominous pitching line that included three hits, six runs, six walks and eight strikeouts. He threw a career-high 112 pitches and became the first to walk six or more in a series game since Edwin Jackson of St. Louis in Game 4 of 2011. Glasnow went to three-ball counts on 12 of 23 batters.Los Angeles expanded its lead to 4-1 in the fifth, when Cash left Glasnow in to face left-handed-hitting Max Muncy with runners at the corners. Muncy hit a one-hopper to first baseman Yandy DÃ­az with the infield in, and Betts beat a strong but slightly offline throw with a headfirst slide past catcher Mike Zunino.Will Smith finished Glasnow with an RBI single, and Chris Taylor and pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez followed with run-scoring singles off Ryan Yarbrough for a 6-1 lead.Justin Turner and Muncy doubled on consecutive pitches in the sixth.Pinch-hitter Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs in the seventh against Victor Gonzalez, who snagged Zunino's line drive and doubled Brosseau off second base for an inning-ending double play.After a regular season played without fans, MLB resumed selling tickets with a limited amount for the NLCS at Globe Life and kept that up by allowing about 28 percent of capacity to be filled at the 40,518-seat ballpark, where the roof was open. The crowd was widely dispersed throughout and was the smallest for the Series since 10,535 attended Game 6 between the Pirates and Tigers at Detroit's Bennett Park in 1909, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.An overwhelming majority of fans wore Dodger blue."They're everywhere. They always come out," Kershaw said. "And so for as much as a game as we would have liked it to have been at Dodger Stadium and the 56,000 chanting, after everything that's gone on this season, to have 10-, 11,000 people in the stands and a good bit of them being Dodger fans is pretty cool."Clayton Kershaw, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts â the Los Angeles Dodgers stars all shined.Nothing out of the ordinary there, even if the setting was surreal.Baseball's best team during the pandemic-shortened season showed off its many talents in the first World Series game played at a neutral site, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.With the seats mostly empty, Kershaw dominated for six innings, Bellinger and Betts homered and the Dodgers chased a wild Tyler Glasnow in the fifth inning and coasted home in the opener.A crowd limited by the coronavirus to 11,388 at Globe Life Field, the new $1.2-billion home of the Texas Rangers, marked the smallest for baseball's top event in 111 years.Los Angeles hopes to go home with a title that has eluded the Dodgers since 1988 but tried to guard against focusing ahead."It's hard not to think about winning.

According to ESPN, Bjorkgren signed a multi-year deal with the Pacers.Bjorkgren, 45, was the assistant under Nick Nurse, named the NBA Coach of the Year last season in the Toronto Raptors. He also had years of experience coach NBA D-League teams."We are very pleased and excited to have Nate as our new coach. This was an extensive and thorough search, and when we reached the conclusion, we felt strongly Nate is the right coach for us at the right time. He comes from a winning background, has experienced championship success, is innovative, and his communication skills, along with his positivity, are tremendous. We all look forward to a long, successful partnership in helping the Pacers move forward," said Kevin Pritchard, president of basketball operations of the Pacers, in a statement."I am honored to take on the role as head coach of the Indiana Pacers. This is something I have prepared for during my career. I want to thank Kevin, Chad (Buchanan), Kelly (Krauskopf), Larry Bird, Donnie Walsh, and Herb and Steve Simon for this opportunity. I also want to thank Nick Nurse for giving me my first professional coaching job 14 years ago. I'm looking forward to working with this great team to achieve our goal as NBA Champions."Bjorkgren's creative thinking began to draw attention after he suggested Nurse use "Box-1 defense" on Stephen Curry in Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the Raptors and the Golden State Warriors last year. The ingenious move worked as Curry failed to even take one attempt in the last quarter of G2. In the end, the Raptors defeated the Warriors 4-2 to win their first NBA Championship in franchise history.Of course, that does not mean Bjokgren's new job will be easy at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Pacers made the NBA playoffs for the fifth straight time in the past 2019-20 season and were eliminated for the fifth time in a row. Moreover, they were swept out in both 2019 and 2020.The Pacers wanted breakthroughs, and they were capable of getting it if they were healthy â injuries had been haunting the team for years. Meanwhile, Bjorkgren may have a better chance of leading the Pacers to achieve a breakthrough if he can help Victor Oladipo find the best himself back. The 28-year-old two-time All-Star guard still has one year left of his contract with the deal, and he already rejected the four-year, 80-million-U.S.-dollar contract extension offer by the Pacers. If he can fully recover from injury and reproduces his incredible performance two years ago in the new season, it will benefit both himself and the Pacers.The Indiana Pacers have appointed Nate Bjorkgren as their new head coach, announced the team on Tuesday.

The English top league was said to have five candidates and it's unclear which of the "Big 6" will be left behind.Kleinman said that the financiers are trying to raise a $6 billion funding package and are negotiating with JP Morgan. FIFA reportedly backed the plan but has denied any involvement."FIFA does not wish to comment and participate in any speculation about topics which come up every now and then and, for which, institutional structures and regulatory frameworks are well in place at national, European and global level," said a spokesperson of the global football governing body.Kleinman's source described the plan as "potentially the most important development in world club football for decades."If the reports about the plan are true, in order to compete with the UEFA Champions League, which is also the most valuable football event in the world, the European Premier League will offer hundreds of millions of pounds of fees for founding teams. Its games will take place during the seasons of other national leagues and each team will play at least 30 games on a format of round-robin home and away fixtures. Again, no details have been confirmed yet.UEFA, which understandably does not like the idea of Super League, told Sky Sports they are against any proposals for a European league and the proposal is nothing but "boring.""The UEFA President has made it clear on many occasions that UEFA strongly opposes a Super League. The principles of solidarity, of promotion, relegation and open leagues are non-negotiable. It is what makes European football work and the Champions League the best sports competition in the world," said a UEFA spokesperson."UEFA and the clubs are committed to build on such strength not to destroy it to create a super league of 10, 12, even 24 clubs, which would inevitably become boring."Former English national team member Gary Neville, who works as a pundit of Sky Sports, called the idea "another wound for football.""It doesn't feel like the right time to be talking about this," said Neville.Liverpool and Manchester United, whose proposal of "Operation Big Picture" was rejected by the Premier League, have come up with an even bigger plan - to establish a "European Premier League," according to Sky Sports.Mark Kleinman of Sky Sports reported that the new league will include as many as 18 top European clubs including Arsenal, Manchester City and Chelsea.

rule violation after a World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal dismissed charges brought against her for registering four "whereabouts failures."The 22-year-old, who won gold at the World Championships in Doha last year, was charged and provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) in June.According to World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules, any combination of three whereabouts failures â filing failures or missed tests â within a 12-month period by an athlete constitutes an anti-doping violation.Athletes guilty of whereabouts failures could face two-year bans or a minimum of one year depending on the degree of fault.In Naser's case, the disciplinary tribunal upheld three of the four AIU charges against her â a filing failure effective Jan. 1, 2019 and two missed tests, on March 12 last year and January 24 this year.However, the tribunal found in Naser's favor with regard to a third alleged missed test on April 12, 2019, which resulted in the charges being dismissed because her three whereabouts failures did not occur within a 12-month rolling period."This was a case very much on the borderline and we hope the athlete will learn from the experience and heed the AIU's warnings," the tribunal said in a statement.(Cover image: Salwa Eid Naser wins the women's 400 meters final at the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, October 3, 2019. /VCG)World

Weihai, east China's Shandong Province, between November 8 and 10.This rule change is no good news for China, which sent Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha to attend the event. Chen and Sun are the No. 1 and No. 3 seeds based on their current world rankings. Meanwhile, China's biggest rival Mima Ito from Japan, is the No. 2 seed. That means Chen and Ito will be in different divisions, but there's no telling which division Sun will end in.If Chen and Sun meet before the final match, one of them has to go, and that will be in Ito's favor. Both Chen and Sun hold an advantageous record over Ito in the past competitions. The last time Chen met Ito happened at the Qatar Open in March. Chen came back from a 1-0 trail and defeated Ito 4-1 in the women's singles final match, winning the gold and claiming her fourth straight victory over Ito.Sun does not fear Ito either. She achieved a 3-2 win over Ito, coming back from a 2-0 trail at the ITTF Team World Cu last year. Sun also beat Ito 4-1 in the ITTF German Open in last October. Ito even shed tears after the loss.All three will make their singles World Cup debut in November, and each of them is eying for the first tile of the event in her career. The competition for Olympic attendance in Tokyo is extremely intense among Chinese players.

As the event is the first since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, the coach said the squad is focusing on their weaknesses, including by increasing strength training. "We work on the weakness or weak events, such as vault or floor exercise, everything will not happen overnight, but the team works hard together every day."Reflecting on his coaching accomplishments around the world, the 52-year-old said he enjoyed coming back to China and was honored to have a chance to guide the Chinese women's squad. "This great team has a lot of good traditions, we just have to keep building on physical ability."The Beijing native also shared several aspects of his approach to coaching. "I think there is no magic word to any sport," the World Cup winner said. "The hard work has to be done every single day. I think the hard part is keeping the athletes healthy, and also enjoying their hard work. I think that's the art of coaching."Coach Qiao is also looking to help the women's squad earn medals for China. When asked what he want to be remembered for most as a coach, he answered he wanted his athletes to learn skills to sustain them through life. "I can educate our next generation to not only learn the skills of gymnastics or winning gold medals, but also skills for life."China's National Gymnastics Championships continues in south China's Guangdong Province. Before the event started, Qiao Liang, the head coach of the women's national team, talked with CGTN's Sports Scene about the team's preparations, as well as his coaching philosophy and his expectations for the contest in the city of Zhaoqing."The hard work in the foundation of this team, we have a strong, good supporting system, and also we have wonderful coaches," Qiao said.

Deng finished the climb in 6.987 seconds, but Niu was even faster to reach the summit in 6.819 seconds. Both beat the world record (7.088 seconds) for women's speed climbing set by Aries Susanti Rahayu from Indonesia. However, since there were no officials from the International Federation of Sport Climbing to monitor the event because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the performance of Niu will not be recognized as a new world record.At the beginning of this month, snooker legend Stephen Hendry came out of retirement after eight years and accepted an invitational tour card to compete on the World Snooker Tour for at least the next two seasons. Previously, the seven-time world champion, who is nicknamed "King of Crucible" and "Emperor of Snooker," spoke to Sports Scene's Wang Dong.The 51-year-old retired in 2012, having slipped out of the World Championship at the quarter-final stage, and also making a 147 break in the event that year. Hendry felt that he might have played longer, but he left public because he wasn't playing well enough to win. "For me, the whole pleasure of playing snooker is to win, when I didn't have the success, I didn't enjoy that much," Hendry said in the interview.Even though the Scot has been away from playing on the main circuit, he has remained around the game as his passion remains in the sport. He's working as a commentator and ambassador for snooker around the world, especially in China. He emphasized that China is one of his favorite places and a big part of his career. He also gave thanks to all his Chinese fans for their support, saying he was flattered by the nickname "Emperor of Snooker."Hendry returned as a player on the 2020 World Seniors Snooker Championship in August, and a link-up with renowned coach Stephen Feeney has spurred him on to have another crack at the main tour. After receiving the invitational tour card, his return seems more realizable this time.When asked his assessment of current players, the snooker legend praised Ding Junhui, who is considered the most successful Asian player in history. "Ding and O'Sullivan have the best cue ball control", the Scot said. "I love Ding as a player, his game is incredible. He should have already won the World Championship because he has everything in his game, but I question if he has the hunger."He also shared his thoughts about Ronnie O'Sullivan's record-breaking success over him. "I wouldn't be happy, I have to be honest if Ronnie broke my record, but he still has to win another two," Hendry said of "The Rocket." The 44-year-old regained the title in Sheffield and is now only one behind Hendry's record seven world titles.Yan Xiaonan is one of the only two ranked Chinese female mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). She currently ranks 10th under the dominance of UFC women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili and, next month at UFC 253, Yan will face Claudia Gadelha from Brazil, with a victory likely to earn her a championship ticket.To earn her #10 position, the 31-year-old beat Poland's Karolina Kowalkiewicz by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night Auckland on February 23 this year.Yan's half-year-older opponent Gadelha comes into the fight on a shorter break, having just won her last fight against Angela Hill by split decision on May 16 at UFC Fight Night in Jacksonville, Florida.'Zhang didn't submit Jedrzejczyk, and I want to achieve that'Yan Xiaonan was the first female Chinese fighter to enter the Octagon. She signed a four-match contact with the UFC and had her first fight on November 25, 2017 at Fight Night Shanghai, eight months before current women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili.During the past four years, Yan has bagged five unanimous decision wins over Kailin Curran, Viviane Pereira, Syuri Kondo, Angela Hill, and Karolina Kowalkiewicz; Zhang also has five wins in this time, but with two submissions and one split decision. Yan's current record is significantly slimmer than that of Zhang, however. Yan is currently on 12-1 with one no contest, while Zhang is 21-1 and undefeated in her last 20. Both of them have a knock out (KO) rate of around 45 percent, but Yan's style has been more focused on striking in recent years.If Yan wins this fight, she would be a championship contender and could take part in the first UFC "China Derby" with Zhang.When asked about whom she'd like to fight the most, Yan said it's Joanna Jedrzejczyk: "Zhang Weili didn't submit her, and I want to achieve that."The fight between Zhang and Joanna is already considered the best female fight in MMA history by many. Zhang won a split decision after five fierce rounds against Joanna and, ever since that incredible victory, Zhang has become a superstar in China. Zhang and Yan both have sanda backgrounds, but when asked about their difference, Yan showed a smile and said, "Zhang's figure is more like Gadelha, and I'm taller.""For Zhang's next fight, which is probably to be made with Rose Namajunas, I think Zhang will win as Rose is not as strong as Jedrzejczyk. And if I win my fight with Gadelha, I think the China Derby will happen soon," Yan said when asked about what she expects from her future.Zhang is already an active champion, but she can't rest on her laurels with another Chinese contender rising through the ranks. Yan said, "I'm well prepared any time, but only if Dana White gives me an opportunity."'Gadelha is a BJJ black belt, I'm striking level 10'Yan Xiaonan passed a 14-day quarantine after coming back from Auckland and has trained consistently since. About the fight against Gadelha, she feels very confident, "I met her twice when I was training in Las Vegas, and I've also watched many videos of her fights. I know her very well." "My Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) coach is from Brazil, and he'd always like me to fight against her, so, we're preparing everything well, especially the strategy that my BJJ coach set for me," Yan added.Yan's coach Ruy Menezes is one of the first generation of BJJ practitioners in China. He got a black belt from the Gracie Family in 2002 and came to China for the first time in the following year. Ruy began to teach Jiu-Jitsu in Beijing in 2009, and he trained China's first UFC fighter Zhang Tiequan, as well as Li Jiangliang, Yan Xiaonan, and many other mixed martial artists.But due to the pandemic of COVID-19, he has been staying in Brazil and may not go to the UFC 253 to be the cornerman for Yan."Recently, my conditioning coach has trained me a lot on my explosive power and one-punch KO ability, but my head coach told me the most important thing is to win the whole match," Yan said."Gadelha is BJJ black belt, much higher than me, and she will definitely try to drag me to the canvas since the very beginning, but people said my standing skills are 'level 10'," the former professional sanda athlete said with a laugh."Gadelha has very good stamina and defence, she'd never been submitted, even after facing Jedrzejczyk twice. For this fight, I'll still focus on the entirety of match, as well try to find a KO opportunity, I believe I can do it."'Usually I'm quiet, but "Fury" in the Octagon'Yan said she's very excited about having the chance to fight a top-10 fighter but also worried about her team's safety due to traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The host venue for the fight has not been decided yet but probably in the Fight Island, but her team was asked to go to the United States next week, then go to Abu Dhabi from there by UFC private flight. They won't quarantine in the U.S."The condition out of China is worse than here, but professional sports are like this, athletes cannot take long rests, and my life has to go ahead," Yan said in a matter-of-fact way.Compared with Zhang, Yan is much less outgoing. She speaks simply, but that doesn't mean she isn't confident: "Every athlete trains to become the champion, if I don't want to be the champion, I wouldn't be an athlete."At the end of the interview, Yan was asked which of her nicknames she likes the most, and she said it's "Fury" and explained, "Usually, I'm quiet and do not like speak, but when I get into training and stand in the Octagon, I'm crazy, like being injected with chicken blood (Chinese proverb about getting invigorated).

I just love the stage!"After a shutdown of exactly five months due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) restarted on the afternoon of June 20. But, like most of the other recently rebooted professional sports leagues in the world, there was no audience at the venue â even the cheerleaders could only perform via an LED screen beside the court.Around two million messages were left by the audience on the Tencent Sports app during their livestream of the game between the Nanjing Monkey Kings and Zhejiang Lions showing people were excited for the return of basketball, but the two on-site commentators still had to ask each other "do you feel excited?" and try to create a positive vibe in the otherwise silent arena.On one hand, playing games behind closed doors is disappointing for fans who wanted to see the game live in the area, but on the other, the situation has led to the CBA regularly broadcasting their games in virtual reality (VR) â like what the NBA has been doing since 2014 â giving the home audience an immersive experience.By cooperating with China Mobile's Migu Video, the CBA lets the audience watch game live in VR, either on their smartphones or with a special headset, from different angles provided by 16 camera stands. The technology also allows fans to show their broadcast themselves in real-time on courtside screens.At the moment, it is easy for a league to broadcast live games in VR, but the penetration of VR devices in the target audiences is still low around the world due to reasons such as the high expense and often inconvenient user experience.Nevertheless, if holding live events behind closed doors becomes a common practice in the post-pandemic age â a period which may last for a relatively long time â will the large-scale application of 5G technology and the live streaming industry's boom on digital platforms combine to make virtual viewing a major component of modern sports?Traditional sports becoming eSportsDuring the pandemic, the world's major professional sports leagues had to pause, and so sports TV channels could only broadcast old games and events. Because of this, livestreams of eSport equivalents became a realistic alternative for fans.Because sports evolved from games, many video games can simulate real sports to a high degree, and some of them also have eSports leagues, like EA Sports' FIFA series, which is a yearly must-buy for a lot of gamers.In fact, some of the more expensive sports, have already been using simulators for a long while. Formula One (F1) is a major example of this, and as racing â in terms of both simulation and arcade styles â is a major genre of video games, F1 games are easily accepted by diehard fans and a wider audience too.F1 Virtual Grand Prix launched an official global league in 2017 and, during the pandemic, many F1 racers joined to stay busy but also keep their skills sharp. And by competing online, many developed closer bonds with their fans.According to an article released by the Ministry of Sports on June 22, F1 Virtual Grand Prix eSports series eclipsed 30 million views on TV and digital platforms combined during the COVID-19 lockdown.The number evidently cannot compete with the trillions of cumulative viewers for the real F1 Grand Prix series in 2019, but it's still a significant result for eSports.Basketball game NBA 2K got a peak number of around 14,000 simultaneous viewers in a live competition which was held with real NBA stars on March 31. FIBA used this as the basis for setting up the international FIBA eSports Open 2020 which was held for the first time ever from June 19 to 21.While it is true that it is becoming more popular for professional leagues to move their offline contests online, when sports lose their physicality, to a large extent, they also lose their essence.Smart sports equipmentMost sports events and exercises must be played with specific equipment, and currently, more and more fitness equipment, whether found in professional gyms or at home, can be combined with video games, like some treadmill and spinning bikes that connect with screens and turn users' workout data into virtual scenes.To get in on the trend, some video game developers are also creating motion sensing peripherals to push their players into getting physical.To give a recent example, Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventure on the Switch platform has become a smash hit during the pandemic, as people can use its ring-shaped peripheral to play a game and keep fit at the same time.Combining exercise with video games dates back to expensive American gyms in the 1980s. But now, motion sensing apps for yoga, dancing, running, cycling and other solo exercises are very common worldwide.However, on an industry-wide level, as sports are all about being "Faster, Higher, Stronger" and differ from exercise by being based in competition and confrontation, to create authentic experiences, sports game developers should consider creating products that allow people to do head-to-head or team sports in small, isolated spaces.Playing sports with X-realityIn the world of Steven Spielberg's 2018 movie "Ready Player One", people from all around the world can use custom avatars to play with and against each other in the same virtual world by using wearable technology.To a certain degree at present, that is already possible: people can walk on omni-direction treadmills or be suspended in midair on wires to expand their active range in a virtual world, and also some helmet or armor-like clothing can let you feel vibrations, heat and wind.This method of playing sports fits the post-pandemic age, but at the moment, it can only be realized in large, public areas such as the shopping malls, arcades and amusement parks due to the size and cost of the equipment.But, even if this were to become readily accessible on a consumer level, it still raises a question: Are gamers satisfied with just simulating traditional sports?A Japanese company has created an innovative team game called HADO with augmented reality (AR) technology. Through the headset's screen, players can see a game world and their human opponents at the same time, and by doing gestures while wearing the arm sensor, players can perform attacking and defensive moves with virtual fireballs and shields.During the pandemic, HADO launched a new project called HADO Xball, which is like a reality show happening behind closed doors. Inspired by Asian hip-hop culture, the players move around like dancers or stuntmen on the set of a martial arts movie and the audience, watching the livestreams from anywhere, can give energy to their favorite players by shaking their phone, increases the interactivity between users and making the impact of "the twelfth man" more direct than ever possible in real world sports.The potential of X-reality is huge, and the market is burgeoning too as the technology is already used in some areas to improve productivity, and many electronic equipment manufacturers such as Apple intend to put AR glasses on sale in the next few years.Chinese mobile company Huawei also launched a cross platform real time Kung Fu game experience powered by Huawei 5G. In the advertisement video, a Kung Fu master equipped with all kinds of sensors remotely fights head-to-head with an eSports gamer.As the slogan of Huawei 5G Kung Fu Showdown is "The pain feels real in 5G," perhaps one day soon, people can get the feeling of playing real sports in the virtual world.(Cover photo designed by Li Chenqi)Zheng Guohua is a 17-year-old middle-distance runner from Tumed Left Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. For the past four years, she has been coached by her father Zheng Long.Father and daughter get up at 4 a.m. every day to train on the road. Dad rides a motorbike and wears flashlights to light up his daughter's predawn route.Because he wants her to maintain her physical condition during the bitter winter months, Long came up with the ingenious idea of building a "home gym" â from discarded items such as used tires and wire.She is very thankful for what her father has done for her.When she's tired of training, she seeks inspiration from his motto, "You can get superman rewards only by making superman efforts."Guohua has won a lot of races and has a best time of 2:28 in the 800 meters â an improvement of 33 seconds over the last three years.Father and daughter have also raised over 6,000 yuan by selling bricks that they picked up on the street. The family, which has a monthly income of just 4,000 yuan, sent all of it to a local charity during the COVID-19 pandemic.(Video Editor: Li Chenqi)Wasps will play in the Gallagher Premiership final against newly-crowned European champions Exeter Chiefs, Premiership Rugby announced on Wednesday.The announcement came after the club received no additional positive cases in the latest round of Covid-19 testing."Everyone at Premiership Rugby is delighted to confirm Wasps' place in the Final after the latest round of tests as part of our PCR COVID-19 screening programme," a statement from Premiership Rugby read in part.Wasps' participation was in serious doubt after the club confirmed four more positive tests on Monday, in addition to the seven reported last Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 11.This means that Challenge Cup winners Bristol Bears, who were comprehensively defeated by Wasps in the semi-final nearly two weeks ago, will not have to replace them in the game.Wasps group chief executive Stephen Vaughan thanked Rugby Football Union (RFU), Premiership Rugby and Public Health England officials for their "clarity and assistance" throughout the entire process."As a club, we are delighted that we can now take our rightful place in this Saturday's Premiership Rugby final.

The game against Paris Saint-Germain wasn't smooth sailing yet even a loss wouldn't have tainted their reputation as clearly being the best club team in Europe as they had steamrolled everyone on their way to the final, including the now infamous 8-2 mauling of FC Barcelona.When Hans-Dieter "Hansi" Flick was appointed as Bayern manager on November 3, 2019, a "new manager bounce" was expected. After all, the side had been floundering under Niko Kovac, so the only way could be up; what nobody really expected was for Bayern to bounce up into the stratosphere.Since Flick arrived last year, the team have won 39 games, lost only three times and drawn exactly once, and the Champions League victory joined a romp through the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal (German league cup) to bring the team a historic treble.Flick's aggressive style of play and the overall team consistency made Bayern look like they would rule the roost for years to come, and normally they would, but this is 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned football on its head and, for Bayern, that has played out in a heavily foreshortened season.There was less than a month between their Champions League win last season and the start of this new one and Bayern Munich's fatigue has showed, most notably in a shock 4-1 loss to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim on September 27. Not only that but last week, the team had two games in 48 hours: a DFB-Pokal game on October 15 and then a Bundesliga game on October 17.This would be fine if Flick had a squad he could rotate through but this summer's transfer window has sapped the Bayern bench. The main loss is midfield maestro Thiago who has moved to Liverpool. Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho returning to their home clubs doesn't help in that area either, especially when the big signings â Leroy Sane, Douglas Costa, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting â are all attackers. Plus, Serge Gnabry, the team's second highest scorer behind Robert Lewandowski last year, has been ruled out of the game due to testing positive for COVID-19.This puts Bayern at a severe disadvantage in tonight's game against Atletico Madrid; not because of the type of weakness but simply because it is a weakness. If there's one manager in all of football who loves to exploit the flaws of opponents, it's the cruel and callous Diego Simeone.Atletico's previous Champions League campaign shows how tactically villainous he can be. Against defending champions Liverpool, once his team took the early lead in the first leg, Atletico played to maintain it by any means necessary. Ten men behind the ball, cynical fouls, possession for the sake of possession; his Atletico will do anything to grind out a result. And now, with the arrival of ex-Barcelona man Luis Suarez, Simeone has a player as notoriously black hearted as himself.After that sensational defeat of Liverpool, Atletico went on to lose to RB Leipzig in the knockout quarterfinals, demonstrating that their tactics are an all-or-nothing gamble. Against a massive side like Bayern Munich, it's a risk, but it could also be their key to victory.When Bayern Munich won last season's Champions League in August, it was something of an inevitability.

In the build up, Manchester United vs. Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) was considered a big game. The zillionaire champions of France vs. the resurgent English bronze medalists. The realpolitik on the night was very different: an empty stadium under a downpour on a chilly Parisian October night set the tone from the very beginning.Limp and lifeless, for the duration â but especially the early goings â this blockbuster fixture could have been passed off as a pre-season friendly. PSG manager Thomas Tuchel had an excuse as most of his star players were out with injuries. What can't be excused was how he seemingly did nothing to mitigate that on the field.PSG's formation is akin to an accordion. Playing in a 4-3-3 formation, that back four tend to stay rigid in front of their goalkeeper, becoming a back seven when necessary. Those three midfielders who dropped back then usually spring forward and push up the pitch to slightly beyond the halfway line where the front three of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel di Maria wait deep. They like to play with space; di Maria to fire in crosses, Neymar and Mbappe to use their incredible pace.This works when you have a full squad firing on both flanks. Without midfielders Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes out due to injury and Marquinhos, technically a center-back but a genuine box-to-box maverick, unavailable also, PSG had practically no service going forwards.To make matters worse, Manchester United looked like they had forgone the concept of formations altogether. Their 3-4-1-2 does leave plenty of space around Bruno Fernandes â the "1" â but their focus on overloading man-to-man defense created scenarios where Fernandes, Scott McTominay, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof and Axel Tuanzebe would smother Neymar and, in the process, leave roughly a third of the pitch for PSG to play in.This bizarre combination, played out a low-effort slow motion, eliminated almost all attacking link-up play so it's not a surprise that the first two goals came from dead ball scenarios and individual errors. In the 20th minute, Anthony Martial was fouled in the box by Abdou Diallo giving United a penalty. Fernandes took it with a hop, skip and a kick into the bottom right corner â only to have it saved by goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Navas, however, was off his line so it was taken again. Fernandes took it with a hop, skip and a kick into the bottom right corner and made it 1-0.Ten minutes into the second half, PSG got a corner and Neymar fired it into the United box. Martial, the closest to Neymar and completely unhurried by opponents, leapt up, closed his eyes and headed it into his own goal while badly trying to defend.At 1-1 and with half an hour left, the game began to look like a real match. Idrissa Gueye and Ander Herrera getting swapped out for Moise Kean and Rafinha lit a spark in PSG and they started to pose a genuine threat going forward; Manchester United's substitution of Alex Telles for Paul Pogba ended up being a game changer.As play opened up in the final stretch, Marcus Rashford found himself with acres of space around the PSG box and had several attempts on goal. The one trend that remained is that these were either individual efforts or clumsy attempts at link-up play. In both cases he was repeatedly snuffed out by Diallo and Presnel Kimpembe.As the clock ticked down and this agonizing display looked to be headed to a 1-1 draw, Pogba, who had been active from the moment he came on, played a short cross to Rashford who turned, ran into the gap between Danilo Pereira and Pablo Sarabia and smashed it diagonally into the bottom left corner.With only three minutes to go, Rashford won the game for United in Paris, just as he did one year ago with the extra time penalty that knocked PSG out of the 2018/19 tournament. Not an exciting or entertaining victory, but an important one for United nonetheless. With current Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig in the same group, Rashford's goal could be crucial in getting his side through to the knockouts.Context is important.

I will only take part in a tournament when I am 100% fit. "At the moment, it looks like I can make my comeback at the Australian Open in January."While he has made significant progress in his recovery, he said he is still not at the point where he can train as usual. "Not yet, more than two hours with the racket are not possible at the moment," said Federer, who is currently ranked fourth in the world and saw Rafa Nadal equal his Grand Slam haul with a 13th French Open title this month. "But I've been working on my stamina and strength absolutely without pain for a while. There will be no further operations."Federer is often asked about his retirement plans, but the Swiss said he would keep playing as long as he was enjoying it. "I have been thinking about ideas for about five years," he said.

It isn't just the date that's strange to see, so is the line-up for tonight's match day 1, which includes teams such as Istanbul Basaksehir from the Turkish Superlig, Rennes from France's Ligue 1 and Ferencvaros from Hungary's Nemezti Bajnoksag I (never heard of it either), all of whom are making their Champions League debut or return after decades away.The most reassuring sight is Manchester United of the English Premier League taking on perennial Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Both veterans of the Champions League, the sides have only ever faced each other once before in the tournament: in the 2018/19 season, PSG won the first leg 2-0 then lost the second to United 3-1.Manchester United's qualification for this Champions League campaign was practically decided in the final game of the season. Having spent the 2019 portion of the Premier League balancing wins, losses and draws, the Red Devils went unbeaten from February 1 onwards, eking their way up the table to third place. They also put together a commendable run in the Europa League, where they got knocked out in the semifinal by eventual winners Sevilla.PSG on the other hand have become a perennial competitor in the Champions League ever since they got taken over by the Qatar Sports Investment group. They reached the final of the foreshortened 2019/20 season but were beaten by Bayern Munich.Typically, the finalists should be the favorites when going up against a team that came up from the Europa League, however the manner in which PSG so recently lost could make Manchester United think their opponents are there for the taking. Les Parisiens spent most of the second half acting bratty, playing for fouls and, when they did concede, very clearly mentally crumbled.Not only are they unlikely to have built mental fortitude in barely eight weeks, manager Thomas Tuchel has said he has just 11 healthy players. While he will be pleased that his strike team of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar are fighting fit, confirmed out of this game are regular starters Juan Bernat, Mauro Icardi, Thilo Kehrer, Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes and Julian Draxler, Marquinhos and Danilo Pereira are expected to start on the bench.Another player missing from the PSG squad is Edinson Cavani, who transferred to Manchester United in the summer transfer window. While he has recently been dealing with his COVID-19 quarantine and not part of the squad in France, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also missing captain Harry Maguire, Marcus Rojo and Phil Jones from his standard line up.This would suggest United go into this as the favorites, but their record in the 2020/21 Premier League season has been appalling.

It isn't just the date that's strange to see, so is the line-up for tonight's match day 1, which includes teams such as Istanbul Basaksehir from the Turkish Superlig, Rennes from France's Ligue 1 and Ferencvaros from Hungary's Nemezti Bajnoksag I (never heard of it either), all of whom are making their Champions League debut or return after decades away.The most reassuring sight is Manchester United of the English Premier League taking on perennial Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Both veterans of the Champions League, the sides have only ever faced each other once before in the tournament: in the 2018/19 season, PSG won the first leg 2-0 then lost the second to United 3-1.Manchester United's qualification for this Champions League campaign was practically decided in the final game of the season. Having spent the 2019 portion of the Premier League balancing wins, losses and draws, the Red Devils went unbeaten from February 1 onwards, eking their way up the table to third place. They also put together a commendable run in the Europa League, where they got knocked out in the semifinal by eventual winners Sevilla.PSG on the other hand have become a perennial competitor in the Champions League ever since they got taken over by the Qatar Sports Investment group. They reached the final of the foreshortened 2019/20 season but were beaten by Bayern Munich.Typically, the finalists should be the favorites when going up against a team that came up from the Europa League, however the manner in which PSG so recently lost could make Manchester United think their opponents are there for the taking. Les Parisiens spent most of the second half acting bratty, playing for fouls and, when they did concede, very clearly mentally crumbled.Not only are they unlikely to have built mental fortitude in barely eight weeks, manager Thomas Tuchel has said he has just 11 healthy players. While he will be pleased that his strike team of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar are fighting fit, confirmed out of this game are regular starters Juan Bernat, Mauro Icardi, Thilo Kehrer, Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes and Julian Draxler, Marquinhos and Danilo Pereira are expected to start on the bench.Another player missing from the PSG squad is Edinson Cavani, who transferred to Manchester United in the summer transfer window. While he has recently been dealing with his COVID-19 quarantine and not part of the squad in France, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also missing captain Harry Maguire, Marcus Rojo and Phil Jones from his standard line up.This would suggest United go into this as the favorites, but their record in the 2020/21 Premier League season has been appalling.

Retrospective punishment can only be considered if an incident was not seen at the time. The verdict has raised further controversy about the decision on the day made by referee Michael Oliver and video assistant referee (VAR) David Coote."Pickford on Van Dijk is a clear challenge that endangers a player with excessive force and should have been deemed a sending-off. A red card should have been issued," former Premier League referee Mark Halsey told BBC. "Why it got missed only the PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Board) can tell us that. It's amazing the statement has come out that they didn't recognize it as a red card, serious foul play challenge. I'm astonished," he added. The stance was supported by another former referee, Mark Clattenburg. "Michael Oliver should have been told to look at his monitor by VAR David Coote. Had Oliver done so, I'm sure he would have sent off Jordan Pickford for his challenge on Virgil van Dijk," he told Daily Mail."I've also heard it claimed Pickford could not be dismissed because Van Dijk was offside â rubbish. Oliver had not blown his whistle by the time Pickford lunged in, so he could still have been punished," he observed. "VAR confirming later Van Dijk was offside does not nullify a red. The bottom line is, Coote should have sent Oliver to his monitor. Given Van Dijk was injured, the referee had plenty of time to review the incident." Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was equally incensed, but his major concern right now is how to deal with Van Dijk's absence."A few things are clear, so he now will be out for a while, that's clear," said Klopp in a press briefing. "We don't want to set any timeframe, to be honest, because each player is different and each individual is different.""So we feel now in this moment extremely, extremely for him because most of us have been in a similar situation and we know that these situations are absolutely rubbish. You don't need it but you have to get over it and Virgil will get over it, 100%, and today is already the first day, if you want, of the recovery," he added. Former defender Jamie Carragher noted that Klopp's side must look to sign a replacement in the January transfer window. "The big question you're looking at now is, can Liverpool win the league without Van Dijk there? I think it blows the title race wide open," the veteran told Sky Sports. "Liverpool have to go into the market in January and not just because of Van Dijk's injury. They were weak in that area anyway.

However, his Spanish teammate Maverick ViÃ±ales will now race solo."During next week's Gran Premio de Teruel, Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP will be fully focusing its efforts on supporting Maverick ViÃ±ales," the statement said.The 41-year-old is currently 14th in the MotoGP standings on 58 points, 63 behind overall leader Joan Mir of Spain who rides for Suzuki.(With input from agencies)China's 10-time LPGA Tour winner Feng Shanshan led a special squad at the Beijing Shadow Creek Golf Club last week to claim the inaugural Sina Cup as she praised the event for showing great potential of Chinese golf talents.Backed by Sina.com, a media titan in China, the inaugural Sina Cup was first of its kind in the country to feature professional golfers and amateurs, male and female in the two-day Ryder Cup-style tournament.  Feng's team was comprised of six female pros, all from the China LPGA Tour and seven male amateurs, many of whom are elite students from prestigious overseas universities.After going into the singles matches on Saturday with an 8-4 lead from the foursome and fourballs sessions on Friday, Feng's team proved too strong for the other side to seal the victory 17-7."I'm really proud of my players who played incredible from day one," said Feng, the current world No. 26 who had her maiden experience as a captain at the event. "As a captain, I did nothing important except for the logistics.

No time frame has been put on his absence by the club but an injury of this nature could force him on the sidelines for several months and even miss the remainder of the campaign.In an Instagram post on Sunday night, the defender said: "I'm now fully focused on my recovery and will do everything I can to be back as quickly as possible. In football, as in life, I believe everything happens for a reason and it's important to try and keep level headed whether going through the highs and lows."According to Sky Sports, Pickford, who escaped a red card from the referee, attempted to make contact with Van Dijk but has yet to speak to him directly.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is yet to speak publicly about the huge blow of losing one of his most reliable players but he questioned why no action was taken against Pickford during his post-game press conference on Saturday."For me it was a clear penalty that I saw.

I still thought it was worth a look on the foul but that didn't happen," said Klopp. "We have no power there, we just sit here and you discuss it with me. You have to ask other people about that, not me. What can I say?"Statistics from the BBC show that Van Dijk has missed just one Premier League game since joining Liverpool.

In his 95 Premier League starts for Liverpool, they have conceded just 78 goals and kept 44 clean sheets.In 2019, he was awarded the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA)'s Player of the Year and also became the first defender to pick up UEFA's Player of the Year award.Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most severe injuries suffered by players and it requires a recovery period of six to nine months.

"This year, I didn't expect that I would have a chance, so in the end nothing is going to change for me... Even if I don't make it, the season was really good for me anyway.

Mohamed Magdi Afsha opening goal inside five minutes and a second-half penalty from Ali Maaloul gave the eight-time winners the win.However, the result might have been different had the hosts converted their chances, including a penalty just before halftime. Al Ahly goalkeeper Mohamed El-Shenawy had fouled Ivorian forward Gbagbo Laurent in the penalty area but he subsequently denied Badie Aouk from the spot.Victory saw Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane get his first win against the Moroccan club in his sixth attempt. The previous five games saw the club he managed, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, lose four times and draw just once.After the game, Mosimane paid tribute to the players, particularly El-Shenawy for his penalty save, but was cautious about early conclusions that the team was already in its 13th final."I'm happy with the result, but I would have been much happier had we scored more goals. We have won nothing yet and must now focus on the return leg till we achieve our target and reach the final."Wydad coach Miguel Gamondi said he was disappointed in the result as it was a home defeat but added that they will do what they can to overturn the deficit."The early goal complicated the game and missing the penalty was even more heartbreaking.

Though he did not score the goal himself, Bassogog gave himself an excellent present for his 25th birthday.This game was not as peaceful as its scoreboard. In the 9th minute, Zall's Liu Yi and Jianye's Fernando Karanga bumped into each other when they competed for a header. Both shed blood. Liu changed a new jersey and had to wear head protection. In the second half, Zall's Song Zhiwei kicked the ball to one of Jianye's players when the game was stalled, almost causing strife. As a result, Song was given a yellow card.Later, Song also committed a foul on Dourado by kicking him down on the ground, but he got away with it.

He believes this separates the UFC from other combat sports leagues, and from the world of contemporary boxing in particular, by keeping competition high and preventing fighters from getting padded resumes.For fans, this is a good thing. For fighters, less so â especially fighters in the position of Brian "T-City" Ortega. Ortega had an undefeated streak of 14-0 with one No Contest that lasted from 2010 to 2018. His loss to then-UFC men's featherweight champion Max Holloway at UFC 231 on December 8, 2018, was due to a doctor's stoppage. It was an anticlimactic end to his hot streak, not so much because of the loss itself, but because it would be the last round Ortega would fight for almost two years.Ortega took almost a year to recuperate from his injuries. During that time, he got into a heated rivalry with Jung Chan-sung, better known to MMA fans as The Korean Zombie (TKZ). Even though it was revealed that it was orchestrated by TKZ's translator Jay Park, it drew a lot of attention, and a fight was signed for UFC Fight Night: Busan on December 21, 2019.An ACL tear forced Ortega to pull out on December 4. That should have been the end of the feud: The trash talk had been revealed to be a put-on, and Ortega was out of action. However, several days later, in an ESPN interview, TKZ said he thought Ortega was ducking him.Certain people in MMA don't take kindly to that sort of banter. Conor McGregor found out the hard way with Khabib Nurmagomedov in the cage, Leon Edwards found out with Jorge Masvidal backstage at UFC Fight Night London, and Jay Park found out when Ortega walked up to him in the crowd and slapped him at UFC 248 on March 7 this year. The hype was now real, and there could only be one fight for Ortega's return.That fight took place at UFC Fight Island 6 on October 18, 2020. After almost two years on the shelf, and with a point to prove, all eyes were on Ortega. The two men are known as brawlers, so it was expected that Ortega would start fast. Instead, Round 1 was almost entirely a feeling out process with Ortega using his jab to set up harder strikes that found their target later into the round.The chess match ended a minute into Round 2 when TKZ sprinted over and tried punch combinations on Ortega's chin. Ortega said he wanted to be "unrecognizable" in this fight, and he showed it. Instead of being drawn into a slugfest, he maintained his composure and built on the jab and jab feints of Round 1 with takedown attempts and feints. TKZ, usually a bulldozer, now looked timid, unsure when to pull the trigger to avoid caught in Ortega's excellent jiujitsu. With barely 60 seconds remaining, he reverted to type and tried another bullrush, only to find himself on the receiving end of a pinpoint reverse elbow.TKZ survived the round, and the remainder of the fight proved "Zombie" isn't just a nickname. It was given to Chan because he's notoriously resilient, but following that second round elbow, he really became dead inside. Even when he had Ortega pinned against the cage, his head was still, and his feet were flat.From there, the only differences in rounds 3, 4 and 5 were how much damage Ortega inflicted on TKZ and how far ahead of him he pulled in terms of points. TKZ only wanted to apply pressure and swing for the fences. Meanwhile, Ortega mixed all his skills to run rings around TKZ and pulverize him. In Round 3, he chased TKZ across the Octagon, hunting for a takedown, only to release when he was expected to pull down and instead cut TKZ open with a punishing right hook.In the final round, TKZ was so confused by Ortega's offense that he found himself getting hit by simple right and left straights. When the final bell rang, it was no surprise that Ortega won by unanimous decision (50-45, 50-45, 50-45). What was surprising was how good Ortega was. It didn't matter that he didn't get a tune-up fight; he didn't need one. He hasn't been gone for 22 months, he's been preparing for 22 months, and now he's better than ever.One thing UFC president Dana White is particularly proud of is ensuring nobody in his organization gets a "tune-up" fight.

Sichuan rookie Zhu Songwei went 1-7 from the field to finish with five points in 20 minutes.After another newbie, Zheng Qilong of the Jiangsu Dragons, scored 20 points in Saturday's season opener, many expected Zhu to have a similar performance. Zhu, 23, averaged 19.6 points and 7.6 rebounds in the Chinese University Basketball Association and had been nicknamed the "Kevin Durant of Shantou University."However, the CBA is a different world. Hu missed six shots, over half of which were wide open. He also committed four fouls and when he was on the court, Sichuan was the losing side. One game could never define Zhu's career but it's a reminder he needs to work harder to adapt to the league.Shenzhen established a safe lead from the beginning with a 15-2 run. Sichuan managed to slim the deficit to single digits more than once but their defense lacked consistency. After the first quarter, Shenzhen finished every quarter leading by 10+ points before taking the win.Dai Huaibo leads Jilin over NanjingThe Jilin Northeast Tigers beat the Nanjing Monkey Kings 105-97 on Sunday. Though Jilin's Jiang Yuxing fouled out early in the fourth quarter, Dai Huaibo carried the team on his shoulders by dropping a game-high 27 points. Dai's constant attack on Nanjing's paint helped Jilin lead 29-10 in free throw attempts.Having missed the playoffs last season, Nanjing went through great changes during the offseason. They hired a new general manager, Huo Nan, appointed a new head coach, Zvjezdan Misimovic, and landed 13 new players.Nanjing saw five of their players reach double-digit points but the team also turned the ball over 21 times, giving Jilin too many opportunities for easy points via fast break. Meanwhile, the 31 fouls they committed also meant Nanjing's players need to get more familiar with each other defensively.Beijing pockets win for Bayi's absenceThe Bayi Rockets, who were scheduled to play the Beijing Ducks on Sunday, did not show up in the arena. Therefore, Beijing was awarded a 20-0 win. There's no official announcement whether Bayi will continue to miss the rest of their games this season.Wang Zhelin is outnumbered by ShanxiThe Shanxi Loongs defeated the Fujian Sturgeons 99-92. Though Fujian's ace center Wang Zhelin put down 32 points and 18 rebounds, both game highs, he could not carry his team to victory alone.Despite Wang's incredible performance, Fujian only saw three of their players reach double-digit points â Huang Yichao (13) and Xu Mingzhi (11). The team's other ace, Chen Linjian, was 1-6 in FGs to score only two points.By contrast, six of Shanxi's players reached double-digits in scoring. Zhou Zhandong had 12 points, four rebounds, nine assists and three steals. His orchestrating added great mobility to Shanxi's offense which Fujian found difficult to contain.In the last two games on Sunday night, the Zhejiang Lions pocketed a big win over the Shanghai Sharks.

The 23-year-old from Brooklyn became the unified lightweight champion and managed to do what few in boxing thought he could do â outbox perhaps the best technician in boxing.Lopez (16-0) added the three titles held by Lomachenko (15-2) to the belt he won last year to become the undisputed 135-champion.Lopez was favored 119-109, 117-111 and 116-112 on ringside scorecards in a bout held without fans at the MGM Grand conference center. The Associated Press had Lopez winning 117-111.Lopez proved faster and stronger than the 32-year-old Lomachenko, who won two Olympic gold medals as an amateur and was regarded as one of the top pound-for-pound fighters as a pro. Surprisingly enough, he was also the better boxer and proved he could close the show by bloodying Lomachenko's eye in the 12th round."I had to dig deep, man," Lopez said. "I'm a fighter, I've got to dig in deep."Lomachenko, ordinarily a slow starter, was too slow this time as he gave away rounds early as he tried to figure out the style of Lopez. By the time the fight got competitive in the eighth round he was too far behind to come back."He's been in a 14-month layoff," Lopez said. "I knew it was going to take him a long time to catch up."Lomachenko, who lost only once in nearly 400 amateur fights and had only one loss as a pro, thought he did better than the scorecards indicated."Definitely I am not agreeing with the scorecards," he said.The fight was the biggest since the pandemic began and would have been a pay-per-view event in normal times. But with no fans it was televised on ESPN, providing boxing with a bigger showcase than it would have gotten otherwise.Lomachenko was a 4-1 favorite but looked rusty early as he tried to solve the style of Lopez. He threw punches only sparingly the first half of the fight, landing just 31 punches in the first seven rounds, before finally picking up the pace in the eighth round."I think the first half of the fight he got more rounds than I did but in the second half of the fight I took over," Lomachenko said. "I was much better."Punch statistics showed Lopez landed 183 of 659 punches while Lomachenko was credited with 141 of 321. In the 12th round Lopez outlanded Lomachenko 50 to 19 and opened up a cut that sent blood flowing down his face and prompted referee Russell Mora to stop the fight with 10 seconds left to have the ring doctor look at it before resuming.Lopez was told by his father in the corner before the 12th round that he was ahead and not to risk anything. But he came out strong and beat Lomachenko to the punch."I didn't know if they had him up on the scorecards or not," Lopez said.Lopez did his trademark backflip in the ring after the unanimous decision was announced.Lopez became the youngest fighter to become a four-belt champion in only his second title fight. He had sought the fight against Lomachenko, angering the Ukrainian with his brash tactics."I love to fight and I can bang too," Lopez said. "That's what a true champion does, I go out there and find a way to win."Teofimo Lopez was brash enough to challenge Vasiliy Lomachenko, and good enough to beat him.Lopez dominated early and finished strong Saturday night to win a unanimous 12-round decision over Lomachenko to unify the lightweight titles in a fight he demanded even though some thought he wasn't experienced enough.Lopez took advantage of a slow start by Lomachenko to build up an early lead, then finished the fight with a big 12th round that left Lomachenko bloodied and beaten on the scorecards. The 23-year-old from Brooklyn became the unified lightweight champion and managed to do what few in boxing thought he could do â outbox perhaps the best technician in boxing.Lopez (16-0) added the three titles held by Lomachenko (15-2) to the belt he won last year to become the undisputed 135-champion.Lopez was favored 119-109, 117-111 and 116-112 on ringside scorecards in a bout held without fans at the MGM Grand conference center. The Associated Press had Lopez winning 117-111.Lopez proved faster and stronger than the 32-year-old Lomachenko, who won two Olympic gold medals as an amateur and was regarded as one of the top pound-for-pound fighters as a pro. Surprisingly enough, he was also the better boxer and proved he could close the show by bloodying Lomachenko's eye in the 12th round."I had to dig deep, man," Lopez said. "I'm a fighter, I've got to dig in deep."Lomachenko, ordinarily a slow starter, was too slow this time as he gave away rounds early as he tried to figure out the style of Lopez. By the time the fight got competitive in the eighth round he was too far behind to come back."He's been in a 14-month layoff," Lopez said. "I knew it was going to take him a long time to catch up."Lomachenko, who lost only once in nearly 400 amateur fights and had only one loss as a pro, thought he did better than the scorecards indicated."Definitely I am not agreeing with the scorecards," he said.The fight was the biggest since the pandemic began and would have been a pay-per-view event in normal times. But with no fans it was televised on ESPN, providing boxing with a bigger showcase than it would have gotten otherwise.Lomachenko was a 4-1 favorite but looked rusty early as he tried to solve the style of Lopez. He threw punches only sparingly the first half of the fight, landing just 31 punches in the first seven rounds, before finally picking up the pace in the eighth round."I think the first half of the fight he got more rounds than I did but in the second half of the fight I took over," Lomachenko said. "I was much better."Punch statistics showed Lopez landed 183 of 659 punches while Lomachenko was credited with 141 of 321. In the 12th round Lopez outlanded Lomachenko 50 to 19 and opened up a cut that sent blood flowing down his face and prompted referee Russell Mora to stop the fight with 10 seconds left to have the ring doctor look at it before resuming.Lopez was told by his father in the corner before the 12th round that he was ahead and not to risk anything. But he came out strong and beat Lomachenko to the punch."I didn't know if they had him up on the scorecards or not," Lopez said.Lopez did his trademark backflip in the ring after the unanimous decision was announced.Lopez became the youngest fighter to become a four-belt champion in only his second title fight.

showed up wearing her regular No. 5 jersey with the team at a pre-season charity match in Tianjin on Saturday.Having spearheaded the team for their 12th CVL title without conceding a single match last season, Zhu had listed Tianjin as her top choice for the upcoming new season, which is scheduled to take off in a tournament format in Jiangmen, southeast China's Guangdong Province on November 12. "Thanks to our last season's cooperation, I've developed really good relationships with my teammates as well as the club. I look forward to my future cooperation with the team," said Zhu, who won her first domestic league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) with Tianjin last year.Before joining Tianjin last season, the 25-year-old Chinese spiker had an incredible ride at the Turkish women's volleyball club Vakifbank Istanbul for three seasons, sweeping a haul of trophies, including the esteemed FIVB Club World Championships and CEV Champions League. She pressed the pause button for her overseas journey last year, joining Tianjin Bohai Bank and playing at China's domestic volleyball league all for one goal in mind â 2020 Tokyo Olympics.That goal also plays a crucial factor in her choice to stay with the Tianjin team. The coaching staff Zhu works with at the Tianjin Bohai Bank, many of them are part of the national team's coaching squad. And some of Zhu's teammates at Team Tianjin, such as Yao Di and Li Yingying, are also national team players who will fight with Zhu in Tokyo.Lang Ping, the head coach of China's women's national volleyball team, has been considerate in giving advice upon Zhu's joining of Tianjin."Coach Lang told me to follow the team's instructions and finish training and all kinds of tasks as planned by the team. At the same time, I should go and communicate whenever I have sustained an injury," said Zhu."She also encouraged me to reach a level of communications with the team where we are familiar with each other's needs."Due to her right wrist's injury, Zhu has taken an eight-week-long break and thus missed out on the Chinese Women's Volleyball Championships which concluded earlier this month. Working on getting back on court, Zhu is optimistic about her recovery and has tremendous trust on the club's physiotherapist Daniel Wai Hong, who is also the therapist with the national team."I will gradually get back my form through each game and work with Daniel to make plans. He can really help me achieve many impossible tasks, and I think I will be fine," said Zhu.Tianjin Bohai Bank claimed league championship last season, and with Zhu, it is on course to their 13th league title. However, Zhu has set her vision beyond securing another domestic crown."Everything is for the Olympics, no matter it is the game or the training," said Zhu. "We need to work on our weaknesses through this domestic league competition as well as the training session leading up to the Olympics."(Cover image: Zhu Ting stand with teammates during a preseason charity volleyball game of the 2020-2021 Chinese Volleyball Super League in Tianjin, China, October 17, 2020. /VCG)China's women's national volleyball team captain and superstar spiker Zhu Ting will continue representing Tianjin Bohai Bank for the Chinese Volleyball Super League (CVL)'s new season as she showed up wearing her regular No. 5 jersey with the team at a pre-season charity match in Tianjin on Saturday.Having spearheaded the team for their 12th CVL title without conceding a single match last season, Zhu had listed Tianjin as her top choice for the upcoming new season, which is scheduled to take off in a tournament format in Jiangmen, southeast China's Guangdong Province on November 12. "Thanks to our last season's cooperation, I've developed really good relationships with my teammates as well as the club.

World No.4 Selby dominated the next two frames, making breaks of 72, 52 and 48 to lead 3-2. Zhou had a chance to win frame six but missed a short range brown, from a tight angle, to a center pocket when he trailed 43-34. He later played a loose safety on the brown and Selby punished him to go 4-2 ahead. The Englishman sealed the result in frame seven with a run of 56. "I didn't play great today but I'm happy to win," Selby told the World Snooker Tour website. The 37-year-old English cueman will meet Neil Robertson in the semifinals, after the Australian fired three centuries to defeat Robbie Williams 5-2. World No.1 Judd Trump and four-time world champion John Higgins will face off in the other semifinal on Saturday. Higgins outplayed Jak Jones 5-1 while Trump saw off Kyren Wilson by the same scoreline. Trump failed to defend his world championship title in August but nevertheless took six ranking titles last season. Higgins, 45, hasn't won any titles since taking the 2018 Welsh Open.  (With input from agencies)Mark Selby's defense of his English Open title continued on Friday, as he beat China's Zhou Yuelong 5-2 in the quarterfinals of this year's tournament. After sharing the first two frames, 22-year-old Zhou made an excellent 51 clearance to lead 2-1.

I believe I now am ready to coach," said Payton in a phone interview on Thursday. "A lot of young NBA players are a voice away from reaching their true potential. I would like to join an NBA staff where I can help coach, mentor and guide players toward the hard work, focus and determination needed to become a reliable contributor to a team's success."As a guy who played 17 years in the league and has worked as a commentator in TNT and NBATV for years, Payton has his own views of the game. "My rookie year was a rude awakening to the type of talent and competition on the NBA level. That summer and every year after I worked extremely hard to get better at all facets of my game. (Coaches) Tim Grgurich, George Karl, Eric Hughes were the extra voices that helped me become an All-Star, NBA champion and a member of the Hall of Fame."The Seattle SuperSonics (today's Oklahoma City Thunder) selected 20-year-old Payton from Oregon State University with the second overall pick in the 1990 NBA Draft. It took him four years refining himself from a young hot head into an All-Star. In the 10 seasons between 1993 and 2003, Payton was nine-time All-Star (the All-Star Weekend was can celled in the compressed 1998-99 campaign), nine-time All-NBA Team, nine-time All-Defensive First Team and Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) in 1996. He is the only DPOY point guard in NBA history.Payton's nickname "The Glove" became increasingly popular after he took Kevin Johnson apart in the Western Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns. Johnson later praised him in the following way: "You think of guys with great hands, like Maurice Cheeks and Derek Harper. Gary is like that. But he's also a great individual defender and a great team defender. He has all three components covered. That's very rare."Unlike many great defenders, Payton also had first-class offensive skills and was a top five orchestrator in the 1990s. He was a sharp slasher and a post-up master. Moreover, Payton and Shawn "Reign Man" Kemp made the most explosive alley-oop in league history before Chris Paul and Blake Griffin.The other signature of Payton's game was his trash talk. He had countless ways of "discussing" with every member of the opponent's family tree once he stepped onto the court and, more importantly, Payton never shut up. Here are some of the words we could write in a proper report:"Get someone out here who can guard me!" Payton to the bench of Stanford Cardinal."Man, you won't even be in the league next year." Payton to Jamie Feick of the Charlotte Hornets."Paper." Payton to John Stockton of the Utah Jazz every time he made a shot in front of the NBA All-Time assist and steal leader in one game in 1996.

Everything I did was authorized."He is currently quarantined at his home in Turin after travelling from Portugal in an air ambulance. "I am continuing my quarantine, I am alone, my family is on another floor, we can't be in contact and it will be like that at least for the next 10 days," the 35-year-old added. Local health authorities in the Piedmont region said that prosecutors had been informed of the departure of Ronaldo and other Juve players to join their respective national teams while the Italian champions were in isolation following two COVID-19 cases among the team's non-playing staff. Juventus said on Thursday that Ronaldo, who claims to not have the "slightest symptom", returned to Italy in a "medical flight authorized by the competent health authorities". The entire Juve team were back in isolation on Wednesday evening after U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie tested positive. Both McKennie and Ronaldo are in quarantine and must test negative before rejoining their teammates. Under UEFA rules a player must provide evidence that he is no longer sick a week before a European match. Ronaldo, who will miss Juve's Serie A match with Crotone and their Champions League opener against Dynamo Kiev on October 20, must test negative on October 21 to play against Barcelona and old foe Lionel Messi a week later. (With input from agencies)Cristiano Ronaldo shot back at Italy's sports minister on Friday by denying that he broke the coronavirus protocol adopted for the country's football after returning from international duty while positive for the disease. On Thursday Minister of Sport Vincenzo Spadafora said that Portugal captain Ronaldo had broken protocol after he left isolation with his club Juventus to join up with his national team and then returned to Italy following his positive test. "I never broke the protocol," Ronaldo said during an interview on Instagram, "I followed all the protocols and I will continue to follow them, my conscience is clear ...

"In the next couple of years, I'm sure we'll get the best out of him."Meanwhile, United skipper Harry Maguire is keen to play on and overcome his poor recent displays for club and country but could miss the Newcastle game with a knock, Solskjaer added.Maguire endured a torrid time in United's 6-1 thrashing by Tottenham Hotspur before the international break and sustained an injury before being sent off in England's 1-0 Nations League defeat by Denmark on Wednesday.But Solskjaer backed the 27-year-old, who also featured in England's 2-1 win over Belgium, to give his critics a fitting response if he is fit enough to play this weekend."When Harry is part of the England team that beats number one-ranked Belgium it's a normal day. Then you get the headlines when you get a sending off, that's football. You have to deal with it," Solskjaer told reporters."Harry has got great resilience. He knows he will bounce back. He wants to play and work his way out of the last couple of games he's been criticized for."But he picked up a knock just before he came off the other night so we'll have a look at him today."United's defeat by Spurs left them in 16th place with three points from as many matches and Solskjaer said his players were ready to turn their fortunes around."We know we've started the season badly and that game ended really badly... we know we have to perform better but we've now had two weeks to think about it, work on it," Solskjaer said.Manchester United have triggered a one-year option on Paul Pogba's contract, extending the France midfielder's deal until June 2022, British media reported on Friday.The 27-year-old returned to United from Juventus in a then world-record deal worth 89 million pounds (114.93 million U.S. dollars) in 2016 but Pogba has suffered with inconsistent form and injuries at Old Trafford amidst constant speculation over his future.The reports said United's decision to extend his contract was taken before Pogba said on international duty with France that he would love to play for Real Madrid one day.United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brushed off those comments from the Frenchman, who would have been out of contract next June, during his news conference on the eve of Saturday's Premier League clash at Newcastle United."Paul's our player, he's going to be here for another two years and sure he's focused on doing his best for us and we want to see the best for Paul," Solskjaer said.

Races have been held with teams operating in isolated bubbles and with regular testing.The total number of races was cut to 17 from the record 22 originally envisaged and the first eight races of the season were held without spectators.

the opener on 32 minutes at the Stade des Costieres and netted again late on as a weary Nimes folded following the early dismissal of center-back Loick Landre.Alessandro Florenzi scored PSG's second

he felt good and that he absolutely wanted to play," said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel."He's the guy who can always make a difference and he did just that."New signings Moise Kean and Rafinha made their PSG debuts with a host of players missing following the international break and just four days ahead of the visit of Manchester United in the Champions League.Ander Herrera, cleared to return after a positive Covid-19 test, drew the first in a series of superb saves from Nimes goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet having replaced the injured Paredes.But Mbappe gave PSG the lead after he was played through by Rafinha, rounding the advancing Reynet before slotting in his third league goal of the campaign.  Everton loanee Kean should have added a second but was denied by an alert Reynet, with Idrissa Gueye and Florenzi also testing the Nimes keeper.Florenzi rattled the post twice in the second half, with a volley and header, but the Italy defender eventually gave PSG room to breathe as he nodded in Sarabia's header back across goal.Mbappe promptly grabbed his second of the night with another nerveless finish after Sarabia shredded a tiring Nimes defence.The Spaniard then caught out the hosts from a quickly-taken free-kick to smack in a fourth through the legs of Reynet two minutes from the end. Earlier, Rennes extended their unbeaten start to the Ligue 1 season despite drawing 1-1 at

negative before rejoining their teammates."I think that, at the moment, the protocols in force for the sports championships, both for Serie A football and for the sports associations and clubs are

Australian Open and the PGA Championship, all due to be played in February, will now no longer take place.It will be the first time since 1945 that the men's Open, won previously by the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman and Rory McIlroy, will not tee off."It's unprecedented and a real blow for Australian golf and its fans," said PGA of Australia chief executive Gavin Kirkman after what he called "months of exhaustive consultations."Australia has closed its international borders to most travelers as part of its effort to suppress the coronavirus pandemic, and even people moving between some of the country's different states and regions can be subject to a mandatory two-week quarantine.PGA officials considered a raft of options to deal with the restrictions, including players entering a hub and competing while serving a strict quarantine period, as well as restricting crowd numbers and movement. But ultimately none proved viable."Even with multiple contingency plans, it has reached a point where decisions have to be made and this, regrettably, is the one we've had to take," said Kirkman.The Australian Open and PGA Championship were originally slated for a late November and early December window, at Melbourne's Kingston Heath and Brisbane's Royal Queensland, respectively.Both were postponed in recent months in the hope a time slot in the late southern summer â potentially near the Women's Australian Open â would buy time to host them. But the impacts of COVID-19, particularly assembling international fields and ensuring the safety of players, spectators and officials, forced the hand of organizers."We look forward to bringing all three tournaments alive again when they return as normal for summer 2021-22," Kirkman said.Australia's three biggest golf tournaments fell victim to the coronavirus pandemic Friday in an "unprecedented blow" to the sport.The men's and women's Australian Open and the PGA Championship, all due to be played in February, will now no longer take place.It will be the first time since 1945 that the men's Open, won previously by the likes of Jack Nicklaus, Greg Norman and Rory McIlroy, will not tee off."It's unprecedented and a real blow for Australian golf and its fans," said PGA of Australia chief executive Gavin Kirkman after what he called "months of exhaustive consultations."Australia has closed its international borders to most travelers as part of its effort to suppress the coronavirus pandemic, and even people moving between some of the country's different states and regions can be subject to a mandatory two-week quarantine.PGA officials considered a raft of options to deal with the restrictions, including players entering a hub and competing while serving a strict quarantine period, as well as restricting crowd numbers and movement.

In an interview with Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday, Li talked about his experience of coaching the national team, his expectations on the new CBA career and views over youth development.Li was appointed as team consultant of Jiangsu in May. Three months later, he became the new head coach of the team. Having finished the last season with a disappointing 17-29 record, Jiangsu are not only young â with an average age only 22 years old â but also little-known. Therefore, Li's job can be very challenging."It does give me a feeling of starting over coming to Jiangsu," said Li. "I was first player and then coach during my 23-, 24-year-long domestic career, but I did not have much experience of coaching top-level games or competitions close to top level. That's why I think it's time for me to start over at a club to collect more experience.""Our team has a lot of young men and only one or two 'older ones.' That means some of the young guys will appear in the starting lineup. Some of them will stay longer than others on the court. Maybe some of the boys are not ready yet, but that's where we are right now."Young blood never lacks passion or fighting spirit, but these are just uncut diamonds who still need time to refine their skills."We need rules both in practice and in the game. I want them to act on their own as long as they follow my forms. I don't want to make excessive demand on everything they do.â"Today's kids lack practice. â¦ I want to increase their practice time to make up for it. Second, I want help them learn how to fear no hardships and how not to give up in front of setbacks. These can all be done via daily training and management."It will take longer for people to forget China's failure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup at home in 2019. As the team's head coach, Li was questioned the most over his choice of rotation and timeouts."I think every coach has his own style and habit for calling timeout and deciding rotation. For example, I did not make that substitution at that moment but I couldn't say 'I should have done that' after the game. â¦ You can't do everything as others expect. They question you because they pay more attention to the result."Having coached the national team for over two years, Li generalized China's problems into two: lack of tough-battle experience and inferior individual ability."We played too little with European teams or stronger American teams, like only very few games a year. It's not the same as playing warm-up games at home. We need to go overseas and attend more competitions like the NBA Summer League or the contests in Europe. Ideally, you train for three or four weeks and then play three or four games. Then you start training again and do the same repeatedly. But our team cannot do this because of many difficulties.""When we say a player 'carries his own system,' like LeBron James, it means wherever he goes, the team plays in his way. Our national team does not have guys like that. We have no Sonny Weems or Jeremy Lin. We always say we play as a team, but how? What is our style? Our players' ability defines team's style. For China, I think passing is still our problem. So is penetrating. We used to call guys who can slash with absolute speed 'sharp blade.' Now we don't have enough of those players."Then what can Chinese players do to solve this problem? Li believes the key lies in making players ask more of themselves. "Chinese players, especially the young ones, are too easily satisfied and lack sense of competition. Without sense of competition, they can't find motivation. They are too comfortable in the clubs. They fall short of the best but are better than the worst. That can't be good for players. That's why I kept telling my guys: you need to want to get better before we can help you.

The fact that they won it in misfortune year only made the title even more special.While everyone was happy, the Lakers' front office may need to leave the parties behind, sit back in front of the desk and figure out how to deal with their current lineup.Anthony DavisThough he was not the Finals MVP, the fact is, the arrival of Davis brought the purple and gold Larry O'Brien Trophy this season. He still has one year (about $28.8 million) left of his current contract and he can choose to opt out of it. If he does, Davis will become an unrestricted free agent and can sign a new five-year deal worth $189.9 million with the Lakers.Hold on that thought because there are other ways to further maximize Davis' earnings. First, he can sign a 1+1 contract and opt out again in 2021 summer to sign a new extension. However, considering that the salary cap may not grow much next year, the increase of Davis' income will still be limited.ESPN's expert Bobby Marks suggested that Davis sign a 2+1 contract with the Lakers and opt out of it in 2022 summer. There will be several benefits via doing so. First, Davis will be qualified for Designated Veteran Player Extension, which is also known as a supermax deal. If the NBA revenues return to normal in 2022, Davis can sign a five-year contract worth $243.6 million with the team.LeBron JamesJames received the fourth Finals MVP of his for good reasons. He led in average points (29.8), rebounds (11.8), true shooting percentage (67.1) and effective field goal percentage (65.7) of the two teams' major rotations during the series. James still has two years ($39.2 million and $41 million) left of his current deal with the Lakers.The purple and gold have the right to extend James contract this summer by another two years, paying him $43 million and $46.5 million in the last two years. Despite his incredible performance this season, James is turning 36 years old in December. Leading the team to win the 17th title definitely deserves reward. The Lakers will need to decide how much the reward should be.Others with player optionThe following four guys have player option during the off-season: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, JaVale McGee and Avery Bradley.Averaging 8.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.0 steals during the Finals did not tell how important Rondo was to the Lakers. He is the team's second orchestrator, bond of perimeter defense and ball distributor in half-court offense.According to Chris Sheridan of BasketballNews.com, Rondo will understandably opt out of the $2.7-million deal of his to become an unrestricted player. Judging by his performance in the playoffs and his old age (34 year), it should not be hard for Rondo to get a two-year, $16-million deal.Pope averaged 12.8 points, the third-highest of the Lakers during the Finals. His defense of Duncan Robinson was very impressive. Though his 30.3-percent 3-point rate was not pretty but Pope took 43 triple attempts, the most of the team and made 13 of them, the second most of the purple and gold. He fit well playing along James.Pope's contract will pay him $8.5 million next year. If he opts out of it, he may receive a similar number of average annual salary.Neither McGee nor Bradley got much chance in the bubble in Orlando. If McGee opts out of his contract, he should still be able to find a new job thanks to his size, athleticism and finishing ability. Bradley, by contrast, may not be that lucky.The Lakers won't have much cap space even if they let all of the four go.

Ajan had been at the IWF for 44 years as general secretary and president. Richard McLaren, the Canadian law professor whose findings in July 2016 led to Russia being banned from all international athletic competitions, including the Rio Olympics, told reporters in June that the IWF was rife with corruption. This included vote buying, doping cover-ups and $10.4 million in cash that cannot be accounted for.

Fortunately, the city will be able to host the all-star event in 2022.Despite the event cancellation, the NFL will still hold the Pro Bowl vote on November 17 to recognize the well-performing players and coaches this season. "The full Pro Bowl rosters will be revealed in December, where the players are determined by the consensus votes of fans, players and coaches. Each group's vote counts as one-third toward determining the 88 All-Star players who are selected to the Pro Bowl roster," said the league in a statement."Additionally, the league will work closely with the NFLPA and other partners to create a variety of engaging activities to replace the Pro Bowl game this season. This virtual recognition of the season's finest players will provide fans the opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of their favorite stars." However, it's still unclear what those activities will be.Vegas was not the only city saw its event postponed. New Orleans, which was supposed to host Super Bowl LVIII in 2024, will have to wait one more year to witness Super Bowl take place at the New Orleans Saints' Mercedes-Benz Superdome for the eighth time.As the NFL will extend the regular season to 17 games from next year, Super Bowl will be one week later than usual as well. That will put the 2024 event on February 13, bringing it into conflict with New Orleans' Mardi Gras event; hence the league's decision.According to CNBC, the NFL will decide next year over the location for 2024 Super Bowl.

The 10 men changes the game and they get a soft penalty."While it was a memorable night for Danish playmaker Eriksen, it was a disappointing one for England who suffered only their second home defeat in 32 competitive internationals.Mbappe strike gives France 2-1 win in CroatiaFrance stretched their unbeaten run against Croatia to eight games after a late goal by Kylian Mbappe gave the World Cup holders a 2-1 win in their Nations League top-tier Group 3 match on Wednesday.The result left France second in the group on 10 points from four games, behind Portugal on goal difference after the European champions brushed aside Sweden 3-0. Croatia have three points and the Swedes none.France beat Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 World Cup final before defeating them by the same score in last month's reverse Nations League fixture."We knew we'd be in a real battle," France coach Didier Deschamps told French TF1 television."We started very well and it's a pity we didn't go two goals clear as Kylian had a big chance. We did what we needed to do in the second half."It's not because we won a trophy in 2018 that you win by clicking your fingers. You have to look at the way the opponents play too."Croatia defender Dejan Lovren rued his team's concentration lapses."France are ruthlessly efficient and they will punish you every time you switch off, even for a split second," he told reporters."Playing against them is very frustrating because you can be as entertaining as you like but to no avail. The three points is all that matters."Portugal brush off Ronaldo absence to outclass SwedenGoals from Bernardo Silva and a brace from Diogo Jota gave Portugal a comfortable 3-0 win over Sweden in the Nations League on Wednesday as the hosts made light of the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo due to a positive COVID-19 test.With 10 points from four games, Portugal top Group 2 in League A on goal difference ahead of France, who beat Croatia 2-1 in Zagreb. The Swedes are bottom of the group after slumping to four straight defeats."We were not asked to play any differently [without Ronaldo], our ambition remains the same," Manchester United's Portuguese midfielder Bruno Fernandes told reporters."The team has great values but it is obvious that it is easier to win with the best in the world."(With input from agencies)Harry Maguire's miserable start to the season continued with a red card as England had two men sent off for the first time in their Nations League defeat by Denmark, while Kylian Mbappe gave World Cup holders France a 2-1 victory in Croatia and Portugal won without Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday.Christian Eriksen's penalty on his 100th appearance for Denmark earned his side a 1-0 win over England in their Nations League clash at Wembley.Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eriksen powered his spot-kick past Jordan Pickford in the 35th minute, a couple of minutes after England center-back Harry Maguire had received a red card for a second booking.The defeat ended a run of nine successive home wins for England, who beat top-ranked Belgium on Sunday, while Denmark, who have lost just two of their last 40 international matches, celebrated their first victory over England at Wembley since 1983.England slipped to third place in Group A2 which is now headed by Belgium with Denmark above England on goal difference."Disappointed to lose the match but extremely proud of how we responded to going down to 10 men," said England manager Gareth Southgate, who rather surprisingly opted not to send on Aston Villa's creative midfielder Jack Grealish when chasing the game."We had a few chances that on another day would have gone in.

The 28-year-old denied the wrongdoing and stressed his innocence. "I feel I am already seen as a sinner of doping, but I am not," Wanjiru said when he heard of his provisional suspension. "I am innocent."According to the AIU's disciplinary report on Wanjiru, the international athlete accepted a "volunteer provisional suspension" in December 2019, agreeing not to race until the final outcome of the case was delivered. Because of this, the four-year ban has been backdated to the day of his original suspension on December 9 last year, which means he won't be allowed to compete again until December 2023. Wanjiru rose to fame after beating Kenenisa Bekele to the 2017 London Marathon title. He was also the winner at the Amsterdam Marathon in 2016, where he set his marathon PB at 2:05:21.In addition to his ban, all results Wanjiru recorded from March 9, 2019, the date when the test was taken, will be disqualified including forfeiture of any medals, titles, ranking points and prize and appearance money.Kenyan long-distance runner Daniel Wanjiru was banned for four years by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) on Wednesday following an Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) violation. He was provisionally suspended in April for "use of a prohibited substance/method" after "abnormalities" were found in his biological passport.

It seems that those working in education can be sacrificed. It is also not possible to know where, to what extent the epidemic has spread, the trade union does not have access to the data," the union said.  Toni Waterman in BrusselsBelgium hit a new record of daily infections on Friday with 7,030 cases.  The average daily rate also continues to spike with more than 5,000 new cases recorded in the past week, up 93 percent from the previous period. Hospitals in Belgium are now bracing for a flood of COVID-19 patients. Medical facilities will go into phase 1A from today, meaning that 25 percent of intensive care unit beds are reserved for coronavirus patients. An interfederal spokesperson said hospitals could be saturated by mid-November.  Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamAll cafÃ©s, restaurants and coffee shops in the Netherlands have to close on Wednesday. Also, alcohol may no longer be sold after 8 p.m. throughout the country. It is still possible to get take away food from restaurants. Although the number of infections in restaurants and bars is relatively small, visiting them leads to many contact moments, said Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Hotels may, however, remain open. Public gatherings, indoors and outdoors, with more than four people are no longer allowed.The new measures will stay in place for at least four weeks, starting Wednesday. In two weeks, the government will evaluate the situation to see whether the rules should be loosened or tightened.In he past seven days, 43,903 people tested positive for COVID-19, an increase of almost 60 percent compared with the week before, while 150 people died, compared with 89 the week before.Iolo ap Dafydd in London Millions of people in the north of England from today are living under stricter conditions as a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic grips the UK.The government's new three-tier system has been implemented, with in Liverpool city and the surrounding region placed on the highest third tier, which could last for three weeks.

Kato's teammates included Mima Ito, Kasumi Ishikawa and Hitomi Sato. Kato participated in the World Table Tennis Championships last year. She started to draw more attention after defeating Ito and China's Chen Meng at ITTF's T2 Diamond League this July.Ito, who currently ranks second in the world, has confirmed she will attend the Finals. Having missed formal matches for eight months, the Japanese ace was eager to find out what she can do now.World's top 16 ranking players were invited to this year's finals but each federation can send no more than four players to men's and women's competitions. China's Fan Zhendong, Xu Xin, Ma Long and Lin Gaoyuan were qualified for men's matches while Chen Meng, Sun Yingsha, Wang Manyu and Liu Shiwen were qualified for women's.

According to Hollinger, the league will give teams eight-week-notice ahead of the start of the season, which will be November 23.Postponing the beginning of the season was just the first step and more will follow. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is still far from under control in the U.S., should the league continue to put all games in a bubble? It's true that it worked behind closed doors in Orlando but let's face it: only 20 teams entered the bubble for eight regular season games and 16 of them attended the playoffs. What will happen if all 30 teams have to finish an 82-game regular season in a bubble (or multiple ones)?The trouble is not over. The NBA wants to bring fans back to the games as much as fans want to do the same. If the new season will take place in a bubble, the league will have to get creative in figuring out how to allow fans in while ensuring the bubble's safety.The MLB may offer the NBA an example to follow as the baseball league put several straight games in one place to slim down teams' time on the road and speed up the season. The NBA must watch out for two things if it wants to introduce that mechanism: first, read carefully the traveling restrictions of the Canadian government for the sake of the Toronto Raptors; second, determine the length of the season (the MLB cut it from 162 games to 60).There's also the problem with the Tokyo Olympics, which has already been postponed to July 2021. Basically, it's impossible for the NBA to finish the whole season before that and even if it somehow does it, one can't expect the best players to join the national team for Tokyo right after an exhausting competition. Either way, it seems unlikely for Team USA to get vengeance for their painful failure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in China in 2019 this time.The 2020 NBA Draft, like the beginning of the new season, was also postponed (to November 18). After that, the free agency market will open, followed by the training camps and then the 2020-21 season.The new NBA season, which should be the 2020-21 campaign, may only happen in 2021 â John Hollinger of The Athletic reported that the new season will begin on January 18, 2021.That means the NBA will return on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and there won't be Christmas Day games.

A game postponed and rescheduled with a second pushed back. Only one practice with two walk-throughs and unrelenting criticism.The Titans remain depleted. They're also still undefeated.Ryan Tannehill threw for three touchdowns and ran for another as the Titans routed the Buffalo Bills 42-16 on a rare Tuesday night in a showdown between two of the NFL's five remaining undefeated teams pushed back two days after a couple more positive tests for Tennessee last week."What this organization has been through over the past couple weeks to really fight through all of that, shake it all off, really limited practice, limited reps and go out and put this kind of win together, I think makes a statement and I'm happy we were able to do that today," Tannehill said.The Titans (4-0) continued their best start since winning their first 10 games in 2008 despite not playing their last game September 27 in Minnesota. Coach Mike Vrabel said everyone in the organization would get a game ball after this performance."I learned a long time ago that the definition of a pro is they make the hard look easy, so whatever situation we're presented with we got to all come together and make the best decisions for the team each and every time," Vrabel said.Malcolm Butler intercepted two passes, the second he returned 68 yards, and both set up short touchdowns for Tennessee. Kareem Orr's recovery of a fumbled kickoff set up Tannehill's fourth TD for 21 points off Buffalo's three turnovers. Kalif Raymond's 40-yard punt return also set up a 1-yard TD run by Derrick Henry."We expected to win," Butler said.The Bills (4-1) had not won five straight games since 2004, and they came in looking for the franchise's best start since 1991 when Buffalo reached the Super Bowl. They also played without starting cornerbacks with Tre'Davious White inactive because of a back injury and Levi Wallace on injured reserve.Starting wide receiver John Brown also was out for Buffalo, which had scored at least 30 points in the past three games."They were ready to go and at the same time we beat ourselves," Bills coach Sean McDermott said.Buffalo center Mitch Morse called this a gut-punch."It's tough, they came out and beat us like a drum," Morse said.Josh Allen came in second in the NFL in yards passing. He threw for 263 yards and two TDs. Stephon Diggs had 10 catches for 106 yards.The Titans needed the turnovers with seven key players on the reserve/COVID-19 list led by wide receivers Corey Davis and Adam Humphries and defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons. They also were missing a couple assistant coaches and two players activated off that reserve list earlier Tuesday were scratched.The Titans got a big boost on the Bills' opening drive.Allen's pass went off Andre Roberts' hands right to Butler, and he returned the interception 29 yards to the Bills 16. Two plays later, Tannehill hit A. J. Brown, who missed the last two games with an injured knee, for a 16-yard TD for the quick lead.The Bills tied it up with a methodical 15-play drive converting four third downs, taking advantage of a Titans' defense playing a pair of rookies in end Larrell Murchison and cornerback Chris Jackson. Allen tossed the ball to Isaiah McKenzie for a 3-yard TD tying it up, the ninth different Bill to catch a TD pass from Allen.The Titans scored 21 of the next 24 points.Tennessee led 21-10 at halftime after Tannehill ran in from 10 yards seconds before the half. Butler refused to go down after picking off an Allen throw to Gabriel Davis late in the third, and Tannehill found Jonnu Smith for a 4-yard TD and a 28-10 lead three plays later.Bills will host Kansas City on Monday night. Safety Micah Hyde denied the Bills got caught looking ahead to the defending Super Bowl champs."No, no, no, no. We were 100 percent focused on the Titans," Hyde said. "We knew this game was going to be played one way or another. It was not looking forward to the Chiefs or anything."Titans will host Texans on Sunday.The Tennessee Titans just put together their most gratifying victory of coach Mike Vrabel's short tenure.They spent the past two weeks dealing with the NFL's first COVID-19 outbreak with each morning bringing news of yet another positive test.

I think the car is obviously outperforming me at the moment because I cannot extract the maximum from the car," he said after completing the maximum 100km allowed."Getting back to the F1 speed is not so easy. I was improving lap after lap and trying to give feedback to the engineers. Also, we had some filming to do, so there were cameras, there were drones following on track."Team boss Cyril Abiteboul said after Sunday's Eifel Grand Prix at Germany's Nuerburgring, where Ricciardo finished third for Renault's first podium since their return as a constructor in 2016, that Alonso was champing to return."We received a message before, during and after the race," said the Frenchman."I think Fernando is like a big shark. And as soon as he starts to feel the blood he wants to attack. That's what I see â I see a shark very hungry."The Spaniard, who won his titles with Renault in 2005 and 2006, has competed in the Dakar Rally and Indianapolis 500 since he was last in Formula One.Double world champion Fernando Alonso said he was ready for a fresh start as he tested the latest Renault Formula One car in Barcelona on Tuesday.The Spaniard, a two-time Le Mans 24 Hours winner, has not competed in a grand prix since he left McLaren at the end of 2018 but is returning next year as the replacement for departing Australian Daniel Ricciardo."It's going to be like a new beginning, getting surprised about the speed of the car, the braking performance, the corner speed, a lot of things that will surprise me once again," the 39-year-old said before the filming day.The test in the RS20 car came 20 years after Alonso first tested with Benetton â the team that then became Renault â at the same circuit.Alonso said preparing for the limited mileage outing had been complicated by COVID-19 restrictions, with fewer days in the simulator to adjust, but the run was worth it."The feeling was good.

Adapted from real events and told through the lens of volleyball legend Lang Ping, it offers a unique glimpse into some of the contentious issues that have compounded her complicated legacy.And therein lies the novelty."'Leap' is distinguished from other patriotic movies in the way that it treats characters in a rather refreshing way while injecting the story with fresh narratives and far-reaching hints," Jing, a movie reviewer who runs his own review website, told CGTN.In recent years, China's entertainment industry has been flooded with movies featuring historical events effusing patriotic sentiments. Making billions in box-office revenues, these movies are beloved by Chinese cinema-goers.While some of these are repetitive, they serve a purpose. "We do need these movies to convey some messages," said Li Jing, another freelance movie reviewer.But "stories need to be told in a way that characters are fully formed," Li explained. "'Leap' is not perfect, but it shows the effort of focusing the narrative on an intricate character."A standard Chinese patriotic movie tends to emphasize individual sacrifices for the collective, but "Leap" did not follow that path, according to Jing. "I believe Peter Ho-sun Chan, the movie director, was more keen on examining the reconciliation between individual fulfillment and collective interests. It transcends the idea that war-time blockbusters are the only type of movies that audiences like."Lang was an indefatigable player in the national women's team when China was just opening up to the outside world in the 1980s. At a time when patriotism was running high and winning sports events on the global stage signified tremendous national pride, Lang and her team secured thrilling victories â including a world championship title and Olympic gold â that still reverberate across the country.After taking up a coaching career in the U.S. and successfully guiding the U.S. national team to notable victories, she returned to China and was determined to lead the struggling Chinese national team back to its peak. But by then, she was no longer just a patriot elated by winning glory for her country, but had become a seasoned, reserved coach accustomed to both victory or defeat.And "Leap" touches on the contentious theme underlying that change: her questioning of China's sports system, where top athletes are required to devote all their energy to their sport but are not prepared for life after their career is over."'Leap' not only acknowledges the fading trend of patriotism in contemporary China, a cause for the loss of spirit that once motivated athletes of older generations, but also hints at Lang's change in attitude towards volleyball as well as the drawbacks of China's sports system," Jing said. "In this respect, Chan approaches these topics with full honesty."Lang suffered permanent injuries due to strenuous training in her early career as an athlete. Even now, she still holds a disability certificate in the U.S.. But before she left China for an overseas coaching career, she was allegedly refused reimbursement for some costly medical bills by the Chinese volleyball association."Chan is very adept at presenting individualism as the product of our time. One of his signature movies in the 1990s, 'Comrades: Almost a Love Story,' depicts a woman who puts her self-interest above others," said Li."In 'Leap,' we can see the unraveling of the same discussion. Though bound to offend some in the audience, this is the sharp reflection of reality," Li added."Leap" follows a number of other bold and thought-provoking films that have come out in recent years.The 2018 movie "The Shadow Play" by Lou Ye took a sharp look at the pervasive practices of forced relocation. "Dying to survive" by Wen Muye, also released in 2018, offers a critical view of China's medical system."Dearest," another one of Chan's works, provocatively dove into the issues surrounding child abduction and did not shun away from the problematic ramifications of China's birth control policies."These movies turned out to be more popular and often received good reviews," noted Jing."Leap" topped the Chinese box office in the first week of its release and has already made 700 million yuan ($104.19 million) since then.Despite speculation that China's censorship system is tightening its grip on the movie industry, a growing number of movie makers have been toeing the line of what is acceptable to the film censors.Lou Ye, director of "The Shadow Play," is known to have challenged the censorship system for years.

Change is never popular, but sometimes change is necessary," observed English Football League (EFL) chairman Ricky Parry, who has long called for "a complete rethink" over the make-up of the country's football. For Parry, the current situation is dire to say the least. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the sports industry, the EFL was full of poorly-managed clubs with a huge financial hole. "The need for a complete rethinking regarding the funding of English professional football predates the COVID-19 crisis," said Parry, who oversees 72 clubs in the three divisions below the Premier League. "The gap between the Premier League and the EFL has become a chasm which has become unbridgeable for clubs transitioning between the EFL and Premier League," he added. This stance is echoed by Nigel Travis, chairman of League Two side Leyton Orient. "Before the pandemic, 75 percent of clubs were losing money - that can't continue. The pandemic has, if you like, exacerbated the problem and we need to get it fixed," he told BBC in a recent interview. "One thing I need to quash is, this isn't about the pandemic, this is about a crisis in football that goes back many years. If clubs don't get something soon you will see clubs disappear, I would predict, within five-six weeks," Travis predicted. Under such circumstances, a radical reform plan, which has been dubbed 'Project Big Picture' was duly unveiled by EFL over the weekend. According to multiple British media outlets, the plan was mainly devised by Liverpool owner, John W Henry, and the Manchester United chairman, Joel Glazer, while Parry, a lifelong Liverpool fan and former Chief Executive of the club, was the driving force behind it. "It's a day to applaud Liverpool and Manchester United," beamed Parry. "Not to be suspicious, not to be critical, but actually just to look at the nuts and bolts of the plan, which really do stand out. Very clear, very simple. It is about a reset. It is about redistribution."Under the proposals, the Premier League will cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with both the League Cup and Community Shield being abolished. Meanwhile, a 250 million pounds ($325 million) rescue fund will be made immediately available to the EFL, who could sell its broadcast rights alongside those of the top flight and would take 25 percent of the future revenue. Most significantly of all, however, the traditional 'big six' of Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur will be given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, which means only six votes will be required to implement significant changes in the future. It inevitably led to accusations of a power grab and triggered a fierce criticism from the UK government. "It's clear that this proposal does not command support throughout the Premier League - it is exactly this type of backroom dealing that undermines trust in football governance," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also condemned what it called a "backroom deal.""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game," a DCMS spokesperson said. The Premier League later weighed in by releasing a statement saying: "In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support." "Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute," it added.While Parry remained unequivocal in his support of the plan, the seeds of division have already been sowed.  "Some Premier League club are very much against the proposal," a West Ham source was quoted as saying by the BBC. "The big six are using COVID for a power grab. If this goes through, over time they will just use more and more for themselves." But another Premier League club source told the Guardian that he was confident about the prospect of the plan, adding: "Beggars can't be choosers. It is about saving the game from oblivion." "Change is never easy. Change is never popular, but sometimes change is necessary," observed English Football League (EFL) chairman Ricky Parry, who has long called for "a complete rethink" over the make-up of the country's football. For Parry, the current situation is dire to say the least. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the sports industry, the EFL was full of poorly-managed clubs with a huge financial hole. "The need for a complete rethinking regarding the funding of English professional football predates the COVID-19 crisis," said Parry, who oversees 72 clubs in the three divisions below the Premier League. "The gap between the Premier League and the EFL has become a chasm which has become unbridgeable for clubs transitioning between the EFL and Premier League," he added. This stance is echoed by Nigel Travis, chairman of League Two side Leyton Orient. "Before the pandemic, 75 percent of clubs were losing money - that can't continue. The pandemic has, if you like, exacerbated the problem and we need to get it fixed," he told BBC in a recent interview. "One thing I need to quash is, this isn't about the pandemic, this is about a crisis in football that goes back many years.

Moukoko joined Dortmund in 2016. He will turn 16 four days before Dortmund host Brugge in the group stages on November 24, when he could become the youngest player in Champions League history.The record is currently held by Nigeria's Celestine Babayaro, now 42, who was 16 years, 86 days old when he played for Anderlecht against Steaua Bucharest in 1994.He famously lasted just 34 minutes before being sent off, but went on to spend eight years at Chelsea.In 2018/19, Moukoko scored 50 goals in 28 matches for Dortmund's Under-17 side against much older opponents. Last season, aged 14, he moved up to the U19 squad and scored 38 goals in 28 matches.Last month, the 15-year-old scored a hat-trick in his first Under-19 game and has already trained with Dortmund's senior squad.He also made his debut in September for the German U20 national team.However, Sebastian Kehl, head of Dortmund's player department, told SID that the club is keen to dampen the hype around their "wunderkind."Making his professional debut would be "a big step and he is only 15 years old. We must give him the necessary peace and time" to develop, Kehl added.Dortmund currently have two 17-year-olds in their first team in Giovanni Reyna and England junior international Jude Bellingham.Borussia Dortmund's Youssoufa Moukoko, who turns 16 on November 20, could make Champions League history next month by becoming the competition's youngest player ever. Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc told German daily Bild "we will enter him on the B list" for the group stages of the Champions League, with Dortmund having drawn Zenit Saint Petersburg, Brugge and Lazio in Group F. The 15-year-old Moukoko, already a prolific scorer in German youth football, is not on the club's 'A' list of players registered for the Champions League competition. However, he will be on their 'B' list, which according to UEFA regulations means a 16-year-old can play, provided he has been at the club for at least two years.

Let the better one win!" Pulev later posted in his profile on the social media Facebook.He did not mention if the bout will be behind closed doors due to Covid-19 restrictions as earlier expected, prompting Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn to say he was willing to move the fight to the Middle East if an audience is allowed there.Joshua beat Andy Ruiz to regain the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles in Saudi Arabia in December.He is, however, due to put them up for grabs in a mandatory fight with the Bulgarian.Pulev has been waiting for a chance to face Joshua for almost three years now after a shoulder injury forced him out of a world title bout in October 2017.The fight should be Joshua's last before taking on WBC champion Tyson Fury in a lucrative all-British unification bout next year.Fury is set to defend his belt before Christmas before what UK media report will be a springtime clash at Wembley, assuming coronavirus crowd restrictions have been lifted by then.The Daily Mail reports that Fury's rematch with Deontay Wilder has been called off due to the "imminent expiration" of the American's contractual right to the third match between the pair, paving the way for the Gypsy King's bout with Joshua.Kubrat Pulev confirmed on Monday that he will face the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua in a title bout in London on December 12.Britain's Joshua was originally scheduled to fight Pulev on June 20, with a second date in July also mooted amid the coronavirus pandemic."It's official: Pulev vs. Joshua on December 12 in London," Pulev posted on his official webpage on Monday, adding that the date and place were final and the contract had been signed."There is no way back, no postponement, no rescheduling!...

I don't think today about the 20th and equal Roger on this great number, today is just a Roland Garros victory and that means everything to me," the world number two said."This love story I have with this city and this court is unforgettable."The final, expected by many to be another great clash in one of the sport's greatest rivalries, turned out to be a bit of a surprise as Nadal dominated throughout in a one-sided match with a flawless performance to score his 100th match win in Paris. He raised his game to an unbelievable level from the start, granting his opponent no error space as he answered every ball deep and heavy. Nadal only committed six unforced errors in the opening two sets altogether and maintained his form to produce a high-quality third set before sealing his victory against Djokovic. "Today you showed why you are the king of clay. Today was a tough match, I was outplayed by a better player today," said Djokovic after losing his third Roland Garros final to Nadal and failing to shrink the gap with Federer and the Spaniard for the most major wins. "He did surprise me with the way he was playing, the quality of tennis he was producing, the level. He's phenomenal. He played a perfect match, especially in the first two sets."Heading into the tournament, many were doubtful about Nadal's continuing dominance amid unfavorable weather conditions as well as his lack of usual preparation on clay courts due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Nadal, this was the toughest test he had ever faced at Roland Garros. But he came through those challenges with potentially his highest level of play in the final to win the tournament.Unforced errors in the more competitive third set gave Djokovic a glimpse of hope that he could turn the match around. However, the king of clay held on, breaking again in the 11th game and bagging the victory. Nadal and Federer, with their haul of 20 majors, now stand three clear of Djokovic, the last active player to beat the Spaniard at Roland Garros.Federer, who has been recovering from knee surgery and just confirmed his participation in the 2021 Australian Open, congratulated his friend."I have always had the utmost respect for my friend Rafa as a person and a champion," he tweeted. "As my greatest rival over many years, I believe we have pushed each other to become better players.""Therefore it is a true honor for me to congratulate him on his 20th Grand Slam victory.

I understand that now, more than ever."What he achieved in so many areas, pushing the limit in terms of the physical side, he really was a pioneer in being the fittest driver."Hamilton became a Mercedes-supported driver when he was 13 and embarking on his international karting career."I'm just unbelievably grateful to Mercedes for giving a young Black boy a chance when I was 13 years old and supporting me all the way," he said.By the time he succeeded Schumacher in the Mercedes F1 team in 2013 Hamilton was already a world champion after winning his first title with McLaren in 2008.On Sunday, Schumacher's 21-year-old son Mick presented Hamilton with one of his father's racing helmets. Hamilton was briefly speechless, but later explained it was not the first in his personal collection."I actually already have one of Michael's helmets," he said. "One of the really, really special moments for me was in Abu Dhabi in 2012 when I went over to the Mercedes hospitality and met with Michael."We exchanged helmets and that was, for me, a moment that I'll never forget. To stand with someone that I grew up watching on TV and have the honor of exchanging jerseys, or helmets ... It's what us sportsmen do and it's the highest sign of respect.""To have his family honor me today, I'm just incredibly humbled. His son is such a great, bright talent, a really genuine human being."I'm going to have two special helmets from Michael in my small living room."(Cover image: Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes is presented with the helmet of Michael Schumacher by Schumacher's 21-year-old son Mick after claiming the Eifel GP and equaling the record for the number of F1 victories in Nurbugring, Germany. /VCG)Lewis Hamilton heaped praise on Michael Schumacher for leading the way in Formula One and thanked Mercedes for gambling on a "young Black boy" following his record-equaling 91st Grand Prix win on Sunday.Speaking at length in the virtual news conference after claiming the Eifel GP, his seventh win of the season, the runaway series leader talked of his admiration and respect for the seven-time champion German whose records he is chasing."That number 91 is so big and, when it's so far away, it's hard for people to perhaps fully understand how hard it was for him to get those 91 wins," six-time F1 champion Hamilton said."To deliver, weekend in and weekend out, year on year, and to stay so in shape and be so precise ... I understand that now, more than ever."What he achieved in so many areas, pushing the limit in terms of the physical side, he really was a pioneer in being the fittest driver."Hamilton became a Mercedes-supported driver when he was 13 and embarking on his international karting career."I'm just unbelievably grateful to Mercedes for giving a young Black boy a chance when I was 13 years old and supporting me all the way," he said.By the time he succeeded Schumacher in the Mercedes F1 team in 2013 Hamilton was already a world champion after winning his first title with McLaren in 2008.On Sunday, Schumacher's 21-year-old son Mick presented Hamilton with one of his father's racing helmets. Hamilton was briefly speechless, but later explained it was not the first in his personal collection."I actually already have one of Michael's helmets," he said. "One of the really, really special moments for me was in Abu Dhabi in 2012 when I went over to the Mercedes hospitality and met with Michael."We exchanged helmets and that was, for me, a moment that I'll never forget. To stand with someone that I grew up watching on TV and have the honor of exchanging jerseys, or helmets ... It's what us sportsmen do and it's the highest sign of respect.""To have his family honor me today, I'm just incredibly humbled. His son is such a great, bright talent, a really genuine human being."I'm going to have two special helmets from Michael in my small living room."(Cover image: Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes is presented with the helmet of Michael Schumacher by Schumacher's 21-year-old son Mick after claiming the Eifel GP and equaling the record for the number of F1 victories in Nurbugring, Germany. /VCG)The ultimate anguish. The ultimate joy.This season, for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, had it all. And it ended in the only fashion that they deemed would be acceptable, with them back atop the basketball world.For the first time since Kobe Bryant's fifth and final title a decade ago, the Lakers are NBA champions. James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Lakers beat the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday night to win the NBA Finals in six games.And it was only fitting that James took the top honors as he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player honors for a fourth time."It means a lot to represent this franchise," James said, recalling what he told team owner Jeanie Buss when he arrived in Los Angeles in 2018: "I wanted to put this franchise back where it belongs. For me to be a part of such a historical franchise is an unbelievable feeling."Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who had to deal with the anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise â and against the Heat franchise that showed him how to become a champion.Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler â the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention. Rajon Rondo scored 19 points for the Lakers.With that, the league's bubble chapter, put together after a four-and-a-half-month suspension of play that started on March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic, is over. So, too, is a season that saw political sparring between the league and China, the death on January 1 of commissioner emeritus David Stern â the man who did so much to make the league what it is â and then the shock on January 26 that came with the news that Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other had died in a helicopter crash.The Lakers said they were playing the rest of the season in his memory.They delivered what Bryant did five times for L.A. â a ring, and the clincher was emphatic.Game 6 was over by halftime, the Lakers taking a 64-36 lead into the break. The Heat never led and couldn't shoot from anywhere: 35 percent from 2-point range in the half, 33 percent from 3-point range and even an uncharacteristic 42 percent from the line, not like any of it really mattered. The Lakers were getting everything they wanted and then some, outscoring Miami 36-16 in the second quarter and doing all that with James making just one shot in the period.Rajon Rondo, now a two-time champion and the first to win rings as a player in both Boston and Los Angeles â the franchises now tied with 17 titles apiece â was 6 for 6 in the half, the first time he has done that since November 2007. The Lakers' lead was 46-32 with 5:00 left in the half, and they outscored Miami 18-4 from there until intermission.Ball game. The 28-point halftime lead was the second-biggest in NBA Finals history, topped only by the Celtics leading the Lakers 79-49 on May 27, 1985.True to form, the Heat â a No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference that finished with a losing record last season, a team that embraced the challenge of the bubble like none other â did not stop playing, not even when the deficit got to 36 in the third quarter.A 23-8 run by Miami got the Heat to 90-69 with 8:37 left. But the outcome was never in doubt, and before long confetti was blasted into the air as the Lakers' celebration formally and officially began.The ultimate anguish.

"France are a great team. They have great players. It's not always possible to create opportunities."Pepe headed home what he thought was a 74th-minute opener when he got on the end of Bruno Fernandes' free-kick but was flagged offside.Ronaldo, chasing his 102nd international goal, was denied by a flying save from Hugo Lloris in added time.Mbappe fluffed France's best when Rui Patricio anticipated his gentle chip when one-on-one with the Portuguese stopper.Both sides are now on seven points, four ahead of Croatia, whose 2-1 home win over Sweden earlier on Sunday was the group's more entertaining match, with a calamitous late lapse from Pontus Jansson allowing the 2018 World Cup finalists to snatch the points in a soaking Zagreb.Defender Jansson dawdled under a high ball into the penalty area with six minutes remaining and allowed Ivan Perisic to nip in behind. The Inter Milan winger then squared the ball for Andrej Kramaric to tap in from close range.Sweden are stuck on no points after losing all three of their matches.Elsewhere, Italy stretched their unbeaten streak to 18 matches and held onto top spot in League A, Group 1 with a stalemate in Gdansk.New Juventus signing Federico Chiesa missed the chance to win the match for the dominant Azzurri from close range in the 11th minute.Roberto Mancini's side are one point ahead of the Netherlands, who also drew 0-0 with Bosnia and Herzegovina, ahead of their meeting in Bergamo on Wednesday.England manager Gareth Southgate said his side showed what they were made of after coming from behind to beat Belgium 2-1 and move top of League A, Group 2 earlier on Sunday.The Three Lions are on seven points, one ahead of the world's top-ranked side after Marcus Rashford's spot-kick and Mason Mount's deflected winner 25 minutes from time cancelled out Romelu Lukaku's early penalty."We are not going to face a more difficult game defensively," said Southgate. "That is the beauty of the Nations League, you get games against this level of opponent."It's a great experience for them and to go and win it, (it) should give them a sense of what might be possible in the next few years."Denmark are three points behind England in third after their simple 3-0 win over bottom side Iceland.In League B, Erling Braut Haaland showed what the rescheduled Euro 2020 will be missing after he slammed home a hat-trick to help Norway to a 4-0 thrashing of Romania.Haaland struck in the 13th, 64th and 74th minutes as Norway moved level on six points with group leaders Austria, 1-0 winners at Northern Ireland.Norway were knocked out of the Euros playoffs by Serbia on Thursday.Portugal and Italy kept hold of first place in their UEFA Nations League groups on Sunday with goalless draws against France and Poland respectively on a night of little drama, while England saw off Belgium to take the initiative in their pool.There was little to talk about at the Stade de France as a star-studded line-up of players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann failed to muster much of a spectacle in the League A, Group 3 match.One-thousand fans gathered in the cavernous stadium just outside Paris to watch France host the reigning European champions, but were treated to just four shots on target as two rugged defenses cancelled out each team's attacks."We didn't score a goal, but we weren't here to score goals," said Portugal coach Fernando Santos.

She did not need to look far for inspiration."It's quite interesting Simon, I actually got into it because of my dad. My father was actually one of the people who was the top most mechanic in the Nissan rally team that time which used to come from Japan to Kenya just to participate in our Safari Rally. so I used to follow him around, he used to take me around on his servicing, when the cars used to come, when they used to go testing, so that is I think when the first bug bit me," says Safina Khan, rally driver.Safina was totally hooked to the "dangerous sport" when she saw an all female crew take part in the iconic Safari Rally."The person who actually sealed the deal for me was when I saw Michelle Mouton and Fabrizia Pons participating in the Safari Rally and I said to myself hey if these ladies can take part in such a powerful machine they were driving an Audi, and a Lancia, Why can't I be part of this one day and the thing which helped me was the fact that I was interested in mechanics so I used to help my dad building the engines doing the servicing and stuff like that at a very young age so I said to myself all I have to do is just follow my passion and that is what I did."Sadly, her chosen career in rallying exposed Safina to ridicule and criticism in a male-dominated sport."But it was a very hard journey I had a lot of naysayers they turned round and said you are going to go and die these cars are going to roll, you will be nowhere to be seen and a woman your place is in the kitchen what are you doing out there that is a man's sport and I said to them no you know what, what the man can do we can do because in the long run we are all humans," Safina submits.Determined to beat all odds and gender discrimination, Safina literary forced her way into the sport."I actually stowed away in one of an auto-cross car that my dad was participating in, in Solai track in Nakuru, I hid the organizers did not see me and when they discovered I was already in the car and we are already on the circuit well its another thing that they had to stop the race just to tell my dad to get me out of the car but then like I said that time I was bitten. From that event I basically continued with school because my father put his foot down and said education first so i had to get back into school and do what I had to do."Upon finishing, school a call came through that changed her life."Then one day I got a call out of the blues from a lady called Michelle, she is also a Kenyan and she asked me whether I was interested in rallying. An our first car was actually a Subaru GC8 we formed a team called ladies luck rally team and we were both Kenyans participating in the circuit in  a subaru Imprezza we did our first rally .... in 1998 that's when we did our first Safari it was very hard. In those day's it was actually a 3,000km event.Since then, Safina has gone on to win 5 coupe de dames trophies in the Safari rally, an Award given for the highest finishing all female crew.She was also crowned as the Kenya Autocross champion in 2018. But her golden moment came when she heard the Kenyan anthem played in Uganda after a stunning performance from her team ladies luck."It was a very important race for us, we started off in the 30's and we actually finished in the top 5 among the top end cars, just me and my driver Michelle, we were the top placed Kenyans. you can imagine the feeling we had when we had our flag across our bonnet, the bonnet of our car, we were taken to the ramp and they played for us our national anthem we actually cried we had tears in our eyes. you know you feel so proud to be Kenyan and to be bringing home the trophies in an alien country or in another country. It's a feeling unknown. when you just hear the national anthem you feel nostalgic."For Safina, the return of the Safari Rally to the World Rally Championship renews hope for more sponsors to get involved in the sport as she eyes the Kenyan title in future. Motorsport has for long been a male dominated sport.

It's a feeling unknown. when you just hear the national anthem you feel nostalgic."For Safina, the return of the Safari Rally to the World Rally Championship renews hope for more sponsors to get involved in the sport as she eyes the Kenyan title in future. Lewis Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher's all-time record 91 Formula One wins on Sunday with an Eifel Grand Prix victory that catapulted the Mercedes driver closer to a seventh world championship.While the Briton triumphed at the Nuerburgring, the German circuit where Ferrari great Schumacher won five times, teammate Valtteri Bottas suffered a huge hit to his title hopes with a first retirement of the season.Hamilton, celebrating his seventh win of the season, is now 69 points clear of the Finn in the standings with six rounds remaining.Red Bull's Max Versteppen finished second, and took a bonus point for fastest lap, with Australian Daniel Ricciardo third for Renault in his first podium since 2018 when he was at Red Bull.(Cover: Lewis Hamilton of the UK and Mercedes GP looks on as he stands on the grid prior to the F1 Eifel Grand Prix at Nuerburgring in Nuerburg, Germany, October 11, 2020. /CFP)Lewis Hamilton equalled Michael Schumacher's all-time record 91 Formula One wins on Sunday with an Eifel Grand Prix victory that catapulted the Mercedes driver closer to a seventh world championship.While the Briton triumphed at the Nuerburgring, the German circuit where Ferrari great Schumacher won five times, teammate Valtteri Bottas suffered a huge hit to his title hopes with a first retirement of the season.Hamilton, celebrating his seventh win of the season, is now 69 points clear of the Finn in the standings with six rounds remaining.Red Bull's Max Versteppen finished second, and took a bonus point for fastest lap, with Australian Daniel Ricciardo third for Renault in his first podium since 2018 when he was at Red Bull.(Cover: Lewis Hamilton of the UK and Mercedes GP looks on as he stands on the grid prior to the F1 Eifel Grand Prix at Nuerburgring in Nuerburg, Germany, October 11, 2020. /CFP)Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic retained their French Open doubles title as they claimed their fourth Grand Slam as a pair with a 6-4, 7-5 victory against Desirae Krawczyk and Alexa Guarachi in the Roland Garros final on Sunday.Hungary's Babos and local favorite Kristina Mladenovic, who were withdrawn from the U.S. Open before the second round due to COVID-19 protocols, have now won four of the last 11 women's majors.It is Mladenovic's fifth women's doubles Grand Slam title after she also won the French Open with fellow Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia in 2016.Babos won all her women's doubles Grand Slam titles with Mladenovic.After an early trade of breaks, second seeds Mladenovic and Babos decisively stole 14th seeds American Krawzcyk and Chilean Guarachi's serve for 5-3 and bagged the opening set in 50 minutes.Babos served for the match at 5-4 after five games went against serve but the pair were broken again, only for Mladenovic to wrap it up with a forehand winner down the line after yet another break.Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic retained their French Open doubles title as they claimed their fourth Grand Slam as a pair with a 6-4, 7-5 victory against Desirae Krawczyk and Alexa Guarachi in the Roland Garros final on Sunday.Hungary's Babos and local favorite Kristina Mladenovic, who were withdrawn from the U.S. Open before the second round due to COVID-19 protocols, have now won four of the last 11 women's majors.It is Mladenovic's fifth women's doubles Grand Slam title after she also won the French Open with fellow Frenchwoman Caroline Garcia in 2016.Babos won all her women's doubles Grand Slam titles with Mladenovic.After an early trade of breaks, second seeds Mladenovic and Babos decisively stole 14th seeds American Krawzcyk and Chilean Guarachi's serve for 5-3 and bagged the opening set in 50 minutes.Babos served for the match at 5-4 after five games went against serve but the pair were broken again, only for Mladenovic to wrap it up with a forehand winner down the line after yet another break.In the words of boxing legend Rocky Balboa, "it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." For a lot of fighters, one solid hit in the form of a loss is enough to derail them. Ronda Rousey never recovered from Holly Holm; Chris Weidman, who was 13-0 in 2015, has gone a grim 5-2 since his loss to Luke Rockhold; Jose Aldo had his soul taken by a Conor McGregor 13-second KO following 10 years undefeated.In the UFC's current bantamweight division, Cory Sandhagen was one of the top prospects. He entered the UFC with a 7-1 record as a lightweight, but quickly went down to bantam and found himself on a five fight win streak over top guys in his weight class such as John Lineker and Raphael Assuncao. This put him in a championship eliminator against Aljamain Sterling at UFC 250 on June 6 this year.Sandhagen was tapped out in under 90 seconds. It seemed he hadn't planned at all for the smaller cage at the UFC APEX Facility and found himself immediately swallowed up by Sterling who grappled, took his back and then locked in a rear naked choke from a standing position, almost as if he were a human rucksack.He already has a loss on his record, but a unanimous decision is very different to this, the kind of fast, definitive and borderline embarrassing loss that can ruin a fighter, particularly when they are on such a commanding hot streak.His next fight, which took place today at UFC Fight Island 5 against Marlon Moraes, would show if this were a blip or a sign Sandhagen had already peaked. Having lost to then-champion Henry Cejudo at UFC 239 on June 8, 2019, Moraes knew he needed a solid win to get another crack at the belt. He got his win against the aforementioned Aldo at UFC 245 at the end of that year; sadly, that feat doesn't mean much anymore and it looked as if he had spent five rounds sparring with a human punch bag instead of actually fighting.It made sense to match him with Sandhagen and find out who is next in line once #1 Sterling finally faces new champion Petr Yan.Sandhagen, significantly taller and with a longer reach than his Brazilian opponent, began Round 1 by intentionally keeping a distance. Any time Moraes attempted a range-finding jab or one of his trademark football volley-esque leg kicks, he shimmied back. When Sandhagen did engage, it was to maintain this gap; he leaned into his jabs to keep his fist as far away from his body as possible.After two minutes he began engaging in earnest, only, again, due to his height and focus on keeping out of Moraes' danger zone, Sandhagen's leg kicks had him dipping so low, it was as if he were attempting the low sweep from Mortal Kombat. Moraes, not known for his patience, swung for the fences.Sandhagen avoided each and it looked like the round was in the can already, but with two minutes left, it started to look like a high-level ploy. Any time Moraes missed, Sandhagen would close in and start attacking, bringing him close enough for a brawl. Unfortunately, Moraes' reliance on hitting hard rather than hitting fast meant he took more damage than he gave.According to UFCstats.com, Moraes landed 12 significant strikes in the first frame, less than half of Sandhagen's 30. Worse still, Sandhagen's incredible variety meant an almost even spread between the head, body and legs with 11, eight and 11 respectively. Moraes landed two leg kicks and the rest of his offense went to the head.Going into Round 2, Sandhagen knew that his fight plan was working and also that Moraes' wasn't. This confidence was clear as he sprinted to the middle of the Octagon to begin. He peppered Moraes with tap-tap jabs and then followed with harder punches and even a front kick when the Brazilian tried to fight back.With 4:32 remaining in the round, Sandhagen hit a question mark kick that smacked Moraes directly above his right eye. As Moraes recovered, Sandhagen could be heard shouting "his orbital's broke," referring to the orbital bone around the eye that had just been hit and barely 20 seconds later, he hit that bone again with a beautiful spinning heel kick for a TKO win.Cool, calm and clinical. In just over six minutes, Sandhagen turned the Sterling loss from a possible derailment to barely even registering as a blip.In the words of boxing legend Rocky Balboa, "it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward."

However, the organizers' controversial decision to write off the campaign's achievement broke the 32-year-old and his compatriots' heart."We won everything we could with Bayern. I was the top scorer in all competitions I featured in and I think a player who achieves this would win the Ballon d'Or," a clearly frustrated Lewandowski told Polish reporters back in August.Like many others in the footballing world, he thought he has been robbed of the 2020 Ballon d'Or.Fortunately, nobody could rob Iga Swiatek of the tennis world's biggest trophy. The 19-year-old Polish girl, who arrived in Paris ranked 54 in the world, defied the odds to win the French Open after overwhelming Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin in the final on Saturday.As the youngest women's French Open winner since 1992, Swiatek became the first Pole to win a Grand Slam singles title, eclipsing the run of Polish legend Jadwiga Jedrzejowska, who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939.Lewandowski was among the first to offer congratulations as the whole Poland erupted into celebration. "What an amazing success, what a great story! Good job, Iga Swiatek," he beamed on Twitter.The exhilaration was shared by tennis star Agnieszka Radwanska, who is the first Polish player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam singles final in 2012, when he stormed into the Wimbledon Championships final and lost to Serena Williams."Congratulations, Iga Swiatek! A fabulous showing for tennis," Radwanska posted on Instagram.Poland's President Andrzej Duda also expressed his public endorsement. "Great thanks and congratulations for Iga Swiatek! A historic day for Poland, for Polish sport and for Polish tennis. Bravo!" he tweeted.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also followed suit, tweeting "Huge congratulations to Iga Swiatek, who has achieved today the success of her life and â I am convinced â just the first success in the Grand Slam. Amazing story written by this young girl on the Roland Garros courts! Paris is Polish today!"Seven-time Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander was equally optimistic about the teenager's bright future. "Iga looked so relieved but also calm, she is going to win so many more â you can see that in her demeanor throughout the whole finals," he said via Eurosport.He was echoed by former British No.1 Tim Henman, who told the Guardian: "Her mentality is so strong when she is so young. Those three elements, the physical, technical and mental are all so important and you see her athletic ability, too.""When you reflect on her mentality, how calm she's been, her sense of belonging she's had out on court, it's been incredible all the way through. When you add it all up â 28 games she lost to win a grand slam in seven matches â it's just been a complete domination. She's such a deserving champion."Facing a deluge of congratulatory messages, Swiatek exuded confidence and calm. "I know it's going to be crazy. I think I'm going to get used to that, it's not going to be a problem for me," the Warsaw native said in his post-game interview."I didn't have problem with, like, getting attention, with people surrounding me. I think it's going to be okay for me. I really appreciate all the support I got during whole two weeks. I know that the whole country was behind me and they all believed in me. I'm going to be happy and proud," she noted.Seven of the past eight grand slam titles have been won by players under the age of 23, and Swiatek knows that the new generation of tennis players need to be more ruthless and consistent if they want to achieve dominance in this sport."I know my game isn't developed perfectly," she observed. "Also I think the biggest change for me is going to be to be consistent. I think this is what women's tennis is struggling with.""That's why we have so many new Grand Slam winners because we are not as consistent as Rafa, Roger, and Novak. That's why my goal is going to be to be consistent. It's going to be really hard to achieve that," she added.Swiatek's path to the French Open titleFirst round: beat Marketa Vondrousova  6-1, 6-2Second round: beat Hsieh Su-Wei 6-1, 6-4Third round: beat Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-2Fourth round: beat Simona Halep 6-1, 6-2Quarterfinal: beat Martina Trevisan 6-3, 6-1Semifinal: beat Nadia Podoroska 6-2, 6-1Final: beat Sofia Kenin 6-4, 6-1When Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski missed out on the chance to win his first Ballon d'Or after the prestigious award was cancelled for the first time since 1956 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland was shocked.As one of the most recognizable Polish stars in the world, Lewandowski was favorite to receive the honor after netting incredible 55 goals in 47 games and helping Bayern win the UEFA Champions League, Super Cup, Bundesliga and German Cup last season.

His reaggravated heel injury somehow became an Archilles Heel for both the team and himself, unable to lift the trophy with a 4-1 in the series on Friday, but instead, losing to the Heat 108-111.Davis looked painful on the floor, clutching his lower right ankle, and stayed on the bench for the rest of the quarter. His heel problem was already obvious in Game 3, the first game the Lakers lost in the series, in which Davis had 15 points and five rebounds, his worst in this Finals. The Lakers still lead the series 3-2.

It is so often right now that it is crazy," said Swiatek, who captured her first tour title in the process."I don't know what's going on. It's overwhelming for me, it's crazy."Two years ago I won a junior Grand Slam (at Wimbledon) and now I'm here. It feels like such a short time," she said.Swiatek is the youngest women's French Open winner since Monica Seles lifted the trophy as an 18-year-old in 1992. She is the first teenage champion since Iva Majoli in 1997."It's crazy for me because I watched Rafael Nadal lift the trophy every year and now I'm in the same place," added Swiatek, the first woman to secure the title without losing a set since Justine Henin in 2007.Swiatek also became just the second unseeded women's Roland Garros champion in the Open era, joining Jelena Ostapenko who claimed a shock title three years ago.  She eclipsed the run of compatriot Jadwiga Jedrzejowska â the most outstanding Polish player of the interwar period â who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939. Swiatek was only the second Polish woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open era after Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon in 2012. She had never previously been beyond the last 16.Australian Open champion Kenin, 21, fell short in her attempt to become the first woman to capture two Slams in the same year since Angelique Kerber in 2016."I just want to congratulate Iga on a great tournament and a great match. You played really well," said Kenin.Swiatek, whose only previous tour-level final came at Lugano, Switzerland last year, dispelled any initial fear of nerves as she won 12 of the first 15 points to surge 3-0 ahead.However, Kenin has made a habit of fighting through tough situations in Paris and broke back when Swiatek served an untimely double fault allowing the American to level at 3-all.Swiatek, who bludgeoned her way into the championship match, conceding just 23 games in six rounds, secured a precious hold before Kenin lost her serve for the second time.Serving for the first set at 5-3, Swiatek dumped a tame backhand into the net on set point and Kenin immediately broke back, ripping a blistering backhand return. Kenin's resilience has been a staple of her success but she cracked again to present Swiatek with two more set points at 4-5, promptly dragging a backhand wide to hand the Pole the opening set.The sixth-ranked Kenin, who had never advanced as far as the quarter-finals on clay before this fortnight, broke to begin the second set.But an undeterred Swiatek responded the following game, smacking a backhand down the line to break once more before holding with ease to go 2-1 up.Kenin subsequently called for a medical timeout to receive off-court treatment on her taped left thigh, but she could not slow the momentum of her opponent as Swiatek broke for a fifth time.Swiatek won the next eight points to storm to the cusp of the title at 5-1, securing a historic triumph with a powerful cross-court forehand on her first match point."I was just mentally consistent. I just wanted to play aggressive as in previous rounds. It was really stressful for me so kind of hard," said Swiatek, who will rise to 17th on Monday."I don't know what made the difference. I won the match point and that is important enough."Polish teenager Iga Swiatek won her country's first Grand Slam singles title on Saturday as she defeated American fourth seed Sofia Kenin 6-4, 6-1 to become the youngest women's French Open champion since 1992.The 19-year-old Swiatek, the lowest-ranked at 54 woman to capture the Roland Garros title in the modern era, is the ninth first-time major champion in the past 14 Grand Slams."It had to be that another underdog won a Grand Slam in women's tennis.

She is the first teenage champion since Iva Majoli in 1997."It's crazy for me because I watched Rafael Nadal lift the trophy every year and now I'm in the same place," added Swiatek, the first woman to secure the title without losing a set since Justine Henin in 2007.Swiatek also became just the second unseeded women's Roland Garros champion in the Open era, joining Jelena Ostapenko who claimed a shock title three years ago.  She eclipsed the run of compatriot Jadwiga Jedrzejowska â the most outstanding Polish player of the interwar period â who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939. Swiatek was only the second Polish woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open era after Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon in 2012. She had never previously been beyond the last 16.Australian Open champion Kenin, 21, fell short in her attempt to become the first woman to capture two Slams in the same year since Angelique Kerber in 2016."I just want to congratulate Iga on a great tournament and a great match. You played really well," said Kenin.Swiatek, whose only previous tour-level final came at Lugano, Switzerland last year, dispelled any initial fear of nerves as she won 12 of the first 15 points to surge 3-0 ahead.However, Kenin has made a habit of fighting through tough situations in Paris and broke back when Swiatek served an untimely double fault allowing the American to level at 3-all.Swiatek, who bludgeoned her way into the championship match, conceding just 23 games in six rounds, secured a precious hold before Kenin lost her serve for the second time.Serving for the first set at 5-3, Swiatek dumped a tame backhand into the net on set point and Kenin immediately broke back, ripping a blistering backhand return. Kenin's resilience has been a staple of her success but she cracked again to present Swiatek with two more set points at 4-5, promptly dragging a backhand wide to hand the Pole the opening set.The sixth-ranked Kenin, who had never advanced as far as the quarter-finals on clay before this fortnight, broke to begin the second set.But an undeterred Swiatek responded the following game, smacking a backhand down the line to break once more before holding with ease to go 2-1 up.Kenin subsequently called for a medical timeout to receive off-court treatment on her taped left thigh, but she could not slow the momentum of her opponent as Swiatek broke for a fifth time.Swiatek won the next eight points to storm to the cusp of the title at 5-1, securing a historic triumph with a powerful cross-court forehand on her first match point."I was just mentally consistent. I just wanted to play aggressive as in previous rounds. It was really stressful for me so kind of hard," said Swiatek, who will rise to 17th on Monday."I don't know what made the difference. I won the match point and that is important enough."Gearing up for the Tokyo Olympic Games next year, China's top table tennis players wrapped up their competition at the national championships in Weihai, east China's Shandong Province, on Saturday.With top athletes from the national team, a total of over 300 players from across the country participated in the 10-day event which began on October 1. The championships consist of seven events -- the men's and women's team events, men's and women's doubles, mixed doubles event, and men's and women's singles events.During a battle between the current and former world number ones, Fan Zhendong retained his King's status to win the men's singles title with a 4-3 victory over Ma Long in the final on Saturday.

Our mentality improved after we took the second and third games," Ma said.Wang Chuqin and Wang Manyu won mixed doubles title after defeating Xu Xin and Sun Yingsha 4-1.The Wang's pair believed their secret to success was "better combination".

The referees only remove their masks to announce penalties. The NFL fined five coaches $100,000 each -- and their teams $250,000 -- for failing to wear masks properly in the early weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the New York Jets sent their team and coaches home on Friday as a precaution after a player received a presumed positive COVID-19 test result. The Jets, who are scheduled to host the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, will work virtually for the rest of the day and the player will be re-tested. The NFL, which is entering the fifth week of its 2020 schedule, has already pushed back a pair of games originally set for Sunday after a number of positive COVID-19 tests among players and personnel on multiple teams. As a result, the New England Patriots' home game versus the Denver Broncos has been pushed back to Monday, while the Tennessee Titans game against the visiting Buffalo Bills is scheduled for Tuesday. (With input from Reuters)Any coach who approaches a referee without wearing a proper face covering now can be slapped with a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. It is a response to complaints from the NFL Referees Association about coaches and other sideline personnel pulling down their masks to yell at officials from close range. "We have seen multiple occasions where head coaches have removed their masks to communicate with game officials during games," Perry Fewell, the NFL's senior vice president of officiating administration, wrote in the memo. "Doing so creates unnecessary, increased risk for the game official, the head coach, and others, and is inconsistent with the requirement that face coverings be worn at all times. ..."The league's COVID-19 protocols require everyone on the sideline to wear a face covering except for players who are actively involved in the game.

But Jimmy Butler and the Miami Heat delayed its appearance. The NBA Finals are not over, not after Butler and the Heat pulled off a virtuoso performance in Game 5 on Friday night.Butler had 35 points, 12 rebounds and 11 assists, and the Heat watched Danny Green's wide-open 3-pointer in the final seconds bounce off the rim on the way to beating Los Angeles 111-108 â cutting the Lakers' lead in the title series to 3-2.Game 6 is Sunday night.Duncan Robinson had 26 points for Miami, which used seven players. Kendrick Nunn had 14 points, Bam Adebayo 13, Tyler Herro 12 and Jae Crowder 11.

Anthony Davis scored 28 points, and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope had 16.The Lakers were seconds away from the title before the Heat rallied to save the season.Los Angeles broke out all the stops: Davis had shiny gold sneakers on, the hue similar to the Larry O'Brien Trophy, and the team made the decision earlier in the week to skip on the scheduled purple uniforms and wear the black ones designed and inspired by Kobe Bryant instead.They were 4-0 in those uniforms. They're 4-1 now.But Bryant, oh, how he would have loved this fight. Drama, all the way to the end.Robinson's 3-pointer with 3:13 left put Miami up by two, and started a stretch where the next nine scoring possessions from either side resulted in a tie or a lead change.Back and forth they went. Butler got fouled with 46.7 seconds left, then slumped over the baseline video boards, clearly exhausted. He made both foul shots for a one-point lead; Davis' putback with 21.8 seconds left got the Lakers back on top.Heat coach Erik Spoelstra used his last timeout before the ensuing possession, just to buy Butler a couple minutes of rest. Butler drove the lane, drew contact and made both with 16.8 seconds left for a 109-108 lead.The Lakers' mission at that point could not have been more simple: Get a basket, win a title.They couldn't do it. James found him all alone for a top-of-the-key 3-pointer which missed, and Herro finished it off with two free throws.Miami was up 93-82 with 10:17 left when James made his sixth 3-pointer of the night â on eight tries to that point.It was go time for the Lakers.James' 3 started a 17-3 run over the next 4:50.

opening 2022 World Cup qualifier on Friday.Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos also got on the scoresheet while star forward Neymar set up two goals in a totally one-sided encounter that sent Brazil top of the South American qualifying table.In a Corinthians Arena deserted due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bolivia showed almost no ambition as Brazil dominated throughout, with PSG's Neymar starting after overcoming a back problem.Inside the first minute, winger Everton volleyed wide from inside the six-yard box and three minutes later his cross was headed off-target by Marquinhos from a similar position.Bolivia couldn't get out of their half, or on the ball, as Coutinho and Everton created a slew of chances down Brazil's left.The pressure told on 16 minutes as Marquinhos headed home from an identical position to his earlier chance as full-back Danilo swung over a cross from the right following a short corner.Even a first half downpour couldn't dampen Brazil's thrust as Coutinho forced a diving one-handed save from goalkeeper Carlos Lampe with a deflected shot.At times it looked like a handball game with Brazil camped on the edge of Bolivia's box, and the visitors keeping 10 men behind the ball at all times.But on the half hour, left-back Renan Lodi got in behind the defense and his cross from the left was turned home from barely a yard out by Firmino.Lampe made a fine one-handed save from a Casemiro free-kick and then smothered a close range finish by Neymar.By the end of the first half, Bolivia had had less than 20 percent possession and their only shot at goal was a free-kick from 40 yards by Fernando Salidas that didn't even beat the wall.If there were still any doubts Brazil would stroll to victory, they were dispelled three minutes into the second period when a sublime pass from Neymar presented Firmino with a tap-in from six yards.On 65 minutes, a cross from Coutinho flew into the net off the unlucky Jose Carrasco's chest.Coutinho then got on the scoresheet heading home a cross from Neymar from six yards.Neymar's attempts to join retired great Ronaldo as Brazil's second highest scorer of all time were frustrated by an offside flag and an injury time save by Lampe.In the night's other match, Atalanta pair Duvan Zapata and Luis Muriel fired Colombia to a 3-0 win over Venezuela.Zapata slid in a Juan Cuadrado cross from inside the six-yard box on 16 minutes and a brace from Muriel had settled the match by half-time.Liverpool striker Roberto Firmino scored a brace as Brazil romped to a 5-0

coronavirus-delayed AFC Champions League after an agreement was reached on Friday between the Asian Football Confederation and the Qatar Football Association (QFA).The Asian football's showpiece event was originally scheduled for early March, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organizers to postpone it to October. However, as several countries still raised concerns over the deadly virus, the tournament was again delayed until November 18.Qatar proved its ability to provide a safe environment for elite competition after the country managed to host the West Zone games for the AFC Champions League without a hitch. Earlier this month, Iranian giants Persepolis were crowned Western champions in Doha after overwhelming Saudi powerhouse Al Nassr 5-3 on penalties. Persepolis will take on the Eastern representative in a single-leg final, which is set to be played on December 19. According to AFC, the venue for the final will be confirmed in due course."We are extremely grateful for the outstanding support of the QFA and are pleased that we can now build on the success of the AFC Champions League (West) while looking forward to the remaining exciting matches in Asia's premier club competition," said Dato' Windsor John, the AFC General Secretary."Everything from the arrival of the teams, the efficient immigration process, the rigorous health screenings, hotels with biosecurity measures, to the state-of-the-art training facilities and stadiums were of the highest possible standard as the AFC insisted that the welfare and well-being of the players, officials and match officials was our top priority," he added.Among four teams from the Chinese Super League, only Beijing Guoan had a single outing, pulling off a 1-0 win over Chiangrai United in Thailand back in February.

"Whitey earned his status as the ace of some of the most memorable teams in our sport's rich history.

I extend my deepest condolences to Whitey's family, his friends and admirers throughout our game, and all fans of the Yankees."Ford had suffered from the effects of Alzheimer's disease in recent years. His death was the latest this year of a number of baseball greats â Al Kaline, Tom Seaver, Lou Brock and Bob Gibson.On a franchise long defined by power hitters, Ford was considered its greatest starting pitcher. He posted the most wins in Yankees history and still owns the record for World Series victories.Not big and not overpowering, the wily left-hander played in the majors from 1950-67, all with the Yankees, and teamed with the likes of Mickey Mantle, Joe DiMaggio and Yogi Berra to win six championships.Ford won 236 games and lost just 106, a winning percentage of .690. He would help symbolize the almost machine-like efficiency of the Yankees in the mid-20th century, when only twice between Ford's rookie year and 1964 did they fail to make the World Series.Ford's death leaves Bobby Brown, who won four Series titles with the Yankees in the 1940s and '50s, as the last living link to prominent Yankees who played with both DiMaggio and Ford.

Sunday will be their 56th clash."This is the house of Rafa," said Djokovic. "I will have the motivation to win, I beat him here in 2015 but this will be the biggest challenge â playing Nadal on clay."Djokovic hailed Tsitsipas, who was appearing in the semi-final of a Slam for only the second time."Stefanos is a big player but after four hours he was tired. He gave me a lot of trouble. I looked calm on the surface but it was a different story inside," added Djokovic who will be in his 27th Slam final.Djokovic took a 5-1 career lead over Tsitsipas into the semi-final and showing no signs of the neck and shoulder injury which blighted his performance against Pablo Carreno Busta in the last eight, he secured the only break of the opener in the second game.Crucially, he saved all five break points he faced.That became seven from seven early in the second set and he made Tsitsipas pay, breaking for a 3-2 edge and backing it up with another for 5-2.The 22-year-old Greek, appearing in his first French Open semi-final, just couldn't make Djokovic crack.An eighth break point came and went in the second game of the third set with Djokovic breaking for 5-4.Having saved two more break points, Djokovic was unable to convert a match point in the 10th game, picked up a time violation and, unsettled by the call as well as disturbances in the crowd, was broken at the 11th time of asking.From the brink of a quick exit, Tsitsipas stayed alive, taking the third set 7-5.Djokovic squandered 10 break points in the fourth set as Tsitsipas, who had also been two sets down in his opening match against Jaume Munar, levelled the match.However, in a final twist and as the clock ticked closer to the four-hour mark, Tsitsipas faded away in the decider, dropping serve twice to hand Djokovic a 4-1 lead.He saved another match point but was powerless on the third as Djokovic fired a clean winner.For 34-year-old Nadal, his win over Schwartzman was his 99th at Roland Garros.He is into his 28th final at the majors and has not dropped a set in the tournament this year."It's always incredible to play here and this is a very special moment," said Nadal after a 10th win in 11 matches against Schwartzman who had shocked him in Rome last month."I played a couple of bad points in the third set but Diego is a very tough player. He probably makes more breaks on the tour than others.""It's different playing against Djokovic, Federer, Rafa, these guys. Is not easy playing them five sets because you have to play your best tennis maybe for three, four hours, five hours. Physically it's very hard," he admitted.(With input from agencies)Novak Djokovic set up a blockbuster French Open title showdown with Rafael Nadal on Friday after a dramatic five-set semi-final victory over Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas.World number one Djokovic, the 2016 champion at Roland Garros, reached his fifth final in Paris, defeating fifth seed Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1 in a roller-coaster of a contest where he had held a match point in the third set.Nadal, the 12-time champion, defeated Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0) to make a 13th final at the tournament.On Sunday, Djokovic can win an 18th major and become the first man in half a century to win all four Slams twice.Nadal, the world number two, can equal Roger Federer's all-time record of 20 Grand Slam title wins.Djokovic is one of only two men to have defeated Nadal at Roland Garros in 15 years.

coronavirus.Ibrahimovic, who went into quarantine two weeks ago when he first tested positive, must test negative twice before he can return to the Milan squad, whose next game is the derby against Inter at the San Siro on October 17.Brazilian defender Leo Duarte, whose last test was also negative, is also continuing his quarantine. The rest of the players are all negative, the club said. City rivals Inter have also been hit by COVID-19, with the club announcing on Thursday that midfielders Radja Nainggolan and Roberto Gagliardini had tested positive.The two new Inter cases come a day after it was revealed that Slovakia defender Milan Skriniar and Italy under-21 international Alessandro Bastoni had also returned positive tests after joining up with their respective national teams. Ibrahimovic first tested positive on September 24, prompting him to fire off a feisty tweet: "The COVID had the courage to challenge me. Bad idea." The 39-year-old has since posted on social networks a video of him training at home.In spite of his absence, Milan have made a decent start to the season, having climbed to second in Serie A after winning all three of their games and reaching the group stages of the Europa League.Ibrahimovic extended his contract with Milan by one year after a six-month stint last season.Zlatan Ibrahimovic looks likely to miss the Milan derby this month after his club AC Milan announced Thursday that the veteran Swede had again tested positive for coronavirus.Ibrahimovic, who went into quarantine two weeks ago when he first tested positive, must test negative twice before he can return to the Milan squad, whose next game is the derby against Inter at the San Siro on October 17.Brazilian defender Leo Duarte, whose last test was also negative, is also continuing his quarantine. The rest of the players are all negative, the club said. City rivals Inter have also been hit by COVID-19, with the club announcing on Thursday that midfielders Radja Nainggolan and Roberto Gagliardini had tested positive.The two new Inter cases come a day after it was revealed that Slovakia defender Milan Skriniar and Italy under-21 international Alessandro Bastoni had also returned positive tests after joining up with their respective national teams. Ibrahimovic first tested positive on September 24, prompting him to fire off a feisty tweet: "The COVID had the courage to challenge me.

I always knew that if I would be in a Grand Slam final, it would be at the French Open," Swiatek said on court after becoming the first Polish woman to reach the Roland Garros final in 81 years and the first at any major since Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon eight years ago.She managed to hit through the court well, both off the forehand and backhand, and painted the red clay with winners, amassing 23 during another typical performance at a tournament in which she also snapped top seed Simona Halep's 17-match winning run.Unable to put up much resistance, Podoroska decided to show more aggression and started coming forward to cut down the time for Swiatek to hit her big shots.Swiatek, who also plays in a doubles semi-final on Friday, kept up the tempo and raced to a 4-0 lead before nervous errors allowed Podoroska to avoid a second-set bagel with a break of serve.The Pole, who has lost only 23 games in six matches, broke back immediately, however, and ended Podoroska's ordeal on the first match point with an unreturned serve. Fourth seed Kenin, who beat Spain's Garbine Muguruza to win the Australian Open in February, proved too solid for the 30-year-old Kvitova who had not lost a set en route to her first French Open semi-final since 2012.A mixture of crafty shot placement, superb defense and some scorching backhand winners, combined with too many Kvitova mistakes, put Kenin in command and her only wobble came when she served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but was broken.When she got a second chance to serve it out at 6-5, however, the American could not be denied as Kvitova fired a forehand wide on match point â a shot that rather summed up the Czech's performance."I had tough matches these past two weeks. It's amazing to be in the final," Kenin said on court.

He measures 170cm (5ft 7in) and is the same height as Ken Rosewall, who won the last of his eight Grand Slam titles in 1972. Apart from the great Australian, no one of that height or less, has won one of the tennis season's four major tournaments â the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open â since 1968, when the sport allowed professionals to enter.Schwartzman is thriving in a world of giants â he is 41cm (1ft 3in) shorter than the tallest Top 50 player, Reilly Opelka, who is 211cm (6ft 11in) â but why is height such a big thing in tennis?  Who is Diego Schwartzman?Named after legendary soccer player Diego Maradona â another sporting superstar from Argentina â Schwartzman always knew he wasnât going to be the traditional height for a tennis player. His childhood nickname is El Peque â a Spanish slang term that roughly translates as "shorty" in English."I have worse problems than being 10 centimeters shorter than everybody else," Schwartzman has said in the past. "When I walk onto a tennis court, I don't think about how tall I am or how much bigger my opponent is. I know there is a difference, but so what?"He has won three ATP singles titles and reached a career-high singles ranking of 11 in June 2018. Before reaching the last four in Paris, his best Grand Slam result was getting to the quarter-finals of the US Open in 2017. He recently beat semi-final opponent Nadal in the Italian Open.  Why is height important in tennis?Itâs partly a question of physics. The taller a player is, the heavier they are and therefore the harder they can hit the ball. It generally means longer arms, which generate more power and afford extra reach, rotation and racket head speed. The crucial advantage, however, is on the serve. Hitting the serve from a greater height means the stroke can be hit harder and with a downward trajectory to make the ball bounce higher on the opponentâs side of the court. The extra height also gives taller players a great margin of error because they have more angles to play with from the point at which the ball is struck.  Have professional players got taller?Definitely. In 1968, when professionals were allowed to enter the major tournaments, the average height of a Grand Slam winner was 176cm (5ft 7in). By 2019, that figure had risen steadily to 186.5cm (6ft 1in). Rosewall was the first Grand Slam champion of the Open era and is also its shortest, the same 170cm height as Schwartzman. The tallest are Juan Martin del Potro and Marin Cilic, the 2009 and 2014 US Open champions respectively, who measure 198cm (6ft 6in).It is not just the champions, the situation is repeating itself across the professional tennis tour. At the end of the 1960s, the average height of a Top 20 player was 181.2cm (5ft 9in). By the end of last year it was 187.5cm (6ft 1in) and the figure is still rising. The average height of the current ATP Top 50 is 188.6cm (6ft 2in) and there are more players taller than 190cm â including two, Opelka and John Isner, topping 200cm (6ft 7in) â than ever before."I think players like me, around my height, are going to be extinct," says the recently retired David Ferrer, who measures 180cm (5ft 9in).The women's game is experiencing a similar trend towards taller players, beginning with Martina Navratilova. The Williams sisters, Petra Kvitova, Maria Sharapova â all 180cm (5ft 9in) or taller â have dominated recent decades in the way that Billie Jean King and Chris Evert dominated the 1960s and 1970s. Both were under 168cm (5ft 6in). How has Schwartzman managed to defy the general rule?By playing to his strengths. Shorter players have a lower center of gravity and better movement around the court. What Schwartzman lacks in power and reach, he more than makes up for in agility and guile. Taller players also tend to tire more easily, because of the extra weight they have to carry around the court, and Schwartzman's endurance is a big asset. Five-set matches, as he showed against the higher ranked Dominic Thiem in Paris, don't worry him.He is also known as one of the, if not the, best returners of serve â he breaks serve regularly in his matches. But the question is whether he can hang on to his own service games to win the big matches. So is there an ideal height for a tennis champion?There have been a wide range of heights of tennis champions. But the current "Big Three" of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are tightly bunched between 185cm and 188cm (6ft 1in). They have dominated for more than 15 years between them. They are in the sweet spot of being tall enough to have some kind of height advantage, but not too tall to hamper their speed around the court and their endurance.Many of the next generation of youngsters coming through â Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Matteo Berrettini and Daniil Medvedev among them â are over 190cm (6ft 2in), but work hard to ensure their movement is not compromised. Zverev played field hockey as a junior to improve his movement and changes of direction in a low-gravity sport. That may suggest the height trend is set to continue.But the final word can be left to Schwartzman, who told reporters after a French Open win over 208cm (6ft 8in) Kevin Anderson in 2018: "I read David and Goliath when I was young in the school, and I just try to think of that when I see Kevin or the guys who are two meters."It's a spirit that has been serving him well two years on.Video editor and graphics: Paula HarveyThe author is a former Level 4 tennis coach, who has worked with regional and national players in the UK. When Diego Schwartzman beat Dominic Thiem to reach the semi-finals of the French Open in a five-hour-plus epic, the Argentine came a step closer to tennis history. Not just because the 28-year-old had reached his first Grand Slam semi-final â against Rafael Nadal, the 12-time Roland Garros champion â but because Schwartzman would equal the record for the shortest player in the Open era to win a major were he to lift the trophy in Paris on Sunday.Schwartzman is the shortest player in the ATP Tour's top 50.

That may suggest the height trend is set to continue.But the final word can be left to Schwartzman, who told reporters after a French Open win over 208cm (6ft 8in) Kevin Anderson in 2018: "I read David and Goliath when I was young in the school, and I just try to think of that when I see Kevin or the guys who are two meters."It's a spirit that has been serving him well two years on.Video editor and graphics: Paula HarveyThe author is a former Level 4 tennis coach, who has worked with regional and national players in the UK.World number one Novak Djokovic advanced to the French Open semifinals after defeating Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta in four sets on Wednesday.Djokovic shrugged off physical issues affecting his neck and arm early in the match to advance with a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4 victory.The quarterfinal at Roland Garros was a rematch of this year's US Open fourth round in which Djokovic was disqualified for accidentally hitting a line judge with a ball in the throat.After the match, Djokovic, the 2016 champion, told reporters that he "definitely" did not feel great coming into the court on the day."A few things happened in the warm-up.

It was the first national diving competition since January this year.Three Rio Olympics gold medalists Chen Aisen, Shi Tingmao and Ren Qian along with world champions Wang Han and Zhang Jiaqi were joined with 150 other divers at the national event.Staged at the newly constructed Hebei Olympic Sports Center Swimming and Diving Hall, the event was the first leg of the Chinese diving national team's tryouts for the Tokyo Olympic Games which have been disrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic."To restart our tryouts for the Tokyo Olympics, we wiped out the points divers accumulated in previous tryouts and only had them for reference use," said Zhou Jihong, president of the Chinese Swimming Association."That aside, divers also have to adjust to the difficulties with switching venues and fierce nationwide competitions.

And it was still the case at this national event. Quan Hongchan, 13, from Guangdong Province delivered a stunning five-round performance at the women's 10-meter platform to claim the gold. She widened the gap against world champion Zhang Jiaqi after the latter had an average third-round diving and maintained her high-quality diving till the very end to top the podium.In a post-game interview, she said she had not thought of defeating a few world champions on the platform."I just follow my coaches' instructions to take the competition as training. To be bold and just go jumping," said Quan.World champion Zhang Jiaqi finished second with 409.10 points, a point enough to outrank foreign players in international competitions."I feel a little bit disappointed because I feel I have more experience and my techniques are much mature than her but I still lost," said Zhang, who was at the top of the podium four years ago at the same competition."I have accepted my defeat but I will keep competing."The star-dubbed men's 10-meter platform on Tuesday featured two Olympic champions as well as four world champions as the 20-year-old Lian Junjie came from behind to outscore Yang Jian in the last jump to finish top at the podium.It was the first time he jumped 409C action with a difficulty of 4.1 in formal competition as he only started to practice it in January."Starting in January, we've been training with the national team and the efforts seem to have paid off," said Lian."I only tried this action for a few times during tests but never in competitions.

I know she plays really aggressive so I needed to have a better first serve percentage and play aggressive myself; I did a great job overall," said Kenin, who won four of her five matches at Roland Garros in three sets."I guess I like winning in three sets. I know it's tough but I'm getting the job done."After a solid start on both sides, Collins served a woeful double fault to hand Kenin the first break of the match, and a 3-2 lead.She held serve and set up another break point at 4-2 but Collins saved it to stay in contention.Kenin was, however, solid on her service games and she bagged the opening set when her opponent's return sailed wide.It was the first time Kenin took a set against Collins in four encounters, and the fourth seed kept her momentum, breaking again for 3-2 in the second set as her unseeded opponent smacked a forehand long.But this time, Collins hit back to level for 3-3 and she started to threaten Kenin's serve, eventually breaking again to level.The comeback was short-lived, though, as Collins quickly fell 4-0 behind in the decider before taking a medical timeout, holding her midriff as she went off the court for treatment before Kenin easily won the remaining two games.(Cover image: Sofia Kenin in action against Danielle Collins during their quarter-finals match on Court Philippe-Chatrier at the French Open in Paris, France, October 7, 2020. /VCG)Fourth seed Sofia Kenin claimed her maiden French Open semi-final spot as she fought to a 6-4 4-6 6-0 victory against fellow American Danielle Collins on Wednesday.The Australian Open champion was kept on her toes for two sets by an opponent who had beaten her in their previous encounters before strolling through the decider to set up a clash with Czech seventh seed Petra Kvitova.Collins was bothered by abdominal pains in the third set, looking unable to give her maximum effort in the finale on court Philippe Chatrier."This is really special, I'm super happy.

He was one of my favorite players, if not my most favored when I was a teenager," Giroud said in reference to the trophy-laden AC Milan legend.  "I'll just carry on and see how far it goes," the Chelsea star added. Now the only player stands in front of him is Thierry Henry, who leads with 51 goals in 123 caps. Judging by Giroud's current fine form, it won't be long before he surpasses the former Arsenal icon.Giroud is accustomed to keeping a low profile and sometimes doesn't get the appreciation he deserves, but he showed the burning fire of ambition when asked whether he was targeting Henry's record. "There's no limit. You have to set yourself goals," observed Giroud. "Let's see when I reach 46, 47 goals."  It was also a historic night for Eduardo Camavinga. The Rennes starlet became the youngest debutant since 1914 last month with an appearance off the bench against Croatia. On Wednesday, Camavinga made history again as he was given his first start in national team color by Didier Deschamps. The youngster duly repaid his coach's trust by delivering an audacious overhead flick for the opener, thus becoming the youngest player to score for France in 106 years. Barcelona striker Antoine Griezmann, PSG talisman Kylian Mbappe, and Bayern Munich's Corentin Tolisso were also on the scoresheet, capping off a wonderful outing for France. Meanwhile, in Lisbon, Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo failed to get off the mark with a goal despite a lively performance against Spain in front of about 2,500 home fans in the stands. The clash served as a test for Portuguese authorities, as 5 percent of the capacity of the Jose Alvalade Stadium was filled, with attendants sitting apart from each other and sticking to social distancing rules. With supporters cheering him on, Ronaldo had a golden chance to break the deadlock just before the hour mark, but the Juventus superstar hit the crossbar with a powerful shot from inside the area.  Atletico Madrid's Joao Felix, who replaced Ronaldo in the 73rd, nearly notched a later winner at the death but fluffed his lines. Before the match, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) announced that Spain and Portugal have signed an agreement to push ahead with their joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup.Spain hosted in World Cup once in 1982, but Portugal has never staged a World Cup before. "Few things can generate more hope and anticipation than the opportunity to organize a World Cup, and we can't think of a better companion than Portugal," said RFEF president Luis Rubiales in a statement. Elsewhere, Germany midfielder Florian Neuhaus scored on his debut, but Turkey came back three times to earn a 3-3 draw. It was Germany's third stalemate in a row and the third straight time that they have failed to win after taking the lead. "I'm disappointed and frustrated. We have had this problem for a while, and the same thing happened in other games," said Germany coach Joachim Low. In other games, Croatia won 2-1 away in Switzerland, while Italy thrashed Moldova 6-0.

After I found rhythm and confidence," Djokovic said afterwards on Court Philippe Chatrier on another damp and chilly night."It was important to stay focused. Many players have said it before me: these four Grand Slams matter the most in tennis history.â"I had some neck and shoulder issues. I'm still in the tournament, so I don't want to reveal too much.

He had already won the world cross country championship five months earlier.Up to Wednesday Cheptegei only had the 18th quickest time over the distance with a best in Doha of 26min 48.36secs, over half a minute outside the record.But his performance in August boded well and he was assisted by some rapid pacemakers, notably the Kenyan Nicholas Kimeli who was a world finalist over 5,000 meters, and electronic timing along the track.Another factor for the fan of Manchester United was his footwear, Nike's carbon-plated Nike Vaporfly worn by Ethiopia's Gidey when she ran the earlier 5,000 meters in 14 minutes 6.62 seconds.The 22-year-old was lowering the previous mark of 14min 11.15 held by her compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba since 2008 by over four seconds.Gidey put up the run of her short career a year after taking 10,000 meters silver at the world athletics championships in Doha.With two pacemakers helping her record bid until the 3,000 meters marker Gidey maintained a ferocious pace to etch her name in athletics' record books."I'm happy," said Gidey. "I dreamed about this record for six years. I want to thank Valencia for giving me this chance.âUganda's Joshua Cheptegei smashed the 10,000 meters track world record and Ethiopia's Letesenbet Gidey set a new mark for the women's 5,000 meters on a heady night of athletics in Valencia on Wednesday.All the talk in the run-up to the meet was of Cheptegei's assault on Kenenisa Bekele's time of 26min 17.53sec established in 2005 in Brussels.The 24-year-old 10,000 meters world champion surpassed expectations, running the distance in 26mins 11.00 seconds to cement his standing as the new middle-distance maestro.This was his third world record this year.In February he claimed the world 5 kilometers road record in Monaco.Then, after a period of coronavirus lockdown in his native Uganda, he returned to Monaco and, in his first race back, wiped almost two seconds off Bekele's 16-year-old track world record time over the 5,000 meters as he clocked 12min 35.36sec.He becomes only the 10th athlete to concurrently hold the 5,000 meters and 10,000 meters world records.Cheptegei served notice of his class when he took silver at the 2017 world championships in London when he was still just 20.Last year he went one better, collecting gold in Doha.

We will not comment more on his state. Tonda, let's go!" Bohemians 1905 club said on Twitter.The club later said that Panenka tested positive for the novel coronavirus.Many of the world's greatest players have attempted Panenkas in big matches.

coronavirus-postponed Tokyo Olympics will be slashed by $280 million, organizers said Wednesday, touting a scaled-back, less flashy Games, with cuts to everything from staffing to pyrotechnics.But the final cost of the event -- officially budgeted before the pandemic at 1.3 trillion yen ($12 billion) -- remains unclear because additional expenses caused by the postponement have not yet been made public."Tokyo 2020 believes that this work will help to create a model for future global events including forthcoming Games amid the new normal in which we now live," organizers said in a statement after a presentation to the International Olympic Committee Executive Board. They said they would put out an updated budget, including additional costs linked to postponement and coronavirus counter-measures, by the end of the year. Plans for a lower-key event were unveiled in late September, with measures including fewer free tickets, scrapping athlete welcome ceremonies, and savings on banners, mascots and pyrotechnics. The final shape of the Games remains unclear, with questions including whether spectators will be allowed -- including foreign visitors -- yet to be resolved. The 2020 Games were postponed earlier this year as the deadly new coronavirus spread around the globe, and are now set to open on July 23, 2021. (With input from AFP)The cost of the coronavirus-postponed

players, coaches and non-sporting staff to adapt to the huge losses suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a club source said on Wednesday. Staff have been notified by the club of the need to reduce costs after posting a loss of 97 million euros ($113.98 million) in their annual financial report, released on Monday. The employees, including players, have been asked to nominate a representative over the next two weeks to represent them in the negotiations over the changes to their salaries, added the source. Like every major sporting competition, La Liga faced huge disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pausing for three months mid-season before completing the final rounds of fixtures without fans which hit income from ticket sales and merchandise. Barca's accounts on Wednesday made for grim reading, showing a 14 percent drop in revenue from the previous year and the doubling of their net debt to 488 million euros. The club enacted a temporary pay cut of 70 percent at the end of March in the height of the pandemic, lasting the duration of Spain's national state of alarm, which ended in June. Barca's financial troubles also led them to spend the close season lightening the biggest wage bill in European football, offloading Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal for next to nothing, while selling Arthur Melo for 72 million euros and Nelson Semedo for 30 million. They only brought in three players, Miralem Pjanic, Francisco Trincao and Sergino Dest for a combined 112 million euros. They failed to make any extra additions before the transfer window shut on Monday, despite showing interest in Manchester City defender Eric Garcia and Olympique Lyonnais forward Memphis Depay. Meanwhile, Spanish club Valencia did not sign any players in the transfer window due to a 100 million euros fall in revenue as a result of the coronavirus, despite letting eight key squad members leave in the close season. (With input from Reuters)Barcelona have begun a

James scored 28 points as the Los Angeles Lakers moved to within one win of a 17th NBA championship on Tuesday with a 102-96 victory over the Miami Heat.Humbled by Miami in game three on Sunday, James and the Lakers came roaring back in a hard-fought defensive battle that was finely balanced until Los Angeles pulled away in the closing minutes.The win leaves the Lakers 3-1 up in the best-of-seven series, meaning they can clinch the championship with victory in game five in Orlando on Friday."It felt like both teams were desperate, understanding the situation they had put themselves in," James said afterwards."Trying to get every extra possession, execute offensively, not to make mistakes defensively, that's what it was all about."James started slowly but clicked in the second half to lead the scoring while providing eight assists and hauling down 12 rebounds.Anthony Davis meanwhile finished with 22 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with a vital 15 point contribution.Caldwell-Pope's tally included a three-pointer and a layup in the closing stages that put the Lakers seven points ahead with two minutes remaining.Davis then drained only his second three-pointer of the night with 39.5 seconds left on the clock to give the Lakers a 100-91 lead and effectively seal the contest.Butler, the 40-point hero of Miami's win on Sunday, was restricted to 22 points, frustrated throughout by a commanding defensive display from Davis."He challenges me every night, I challenge him every night," James said of Davis. "We have to do things to help our team win, defensively, and offensively, and he did that tonight â he was spectacular."Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the game had been decided in key moments in the closing stages."There was some moments of truth there at the end, and probably the bottom line is they won those moments of truth," Spoelstra said."It came down to making plays. They just made more plays and more shots to seal it."An attritional contest saw defenses on top throughout, with Miami containing the threat of James and Davis for long periods.James in particular struggled to generate his usual rhythm throughout the first half, giving up five turnovers and scoring just eight points.The Lakers looked to have built a head of steam towards the end of the first quarter, edging into a 27-22 lead after a Kyle Kuzma three-pointer and a driving layup from Alex Caruso.But Miami responded swiftly at the start of the second quarter, transforming a five-point deficit into a 33-29 lead after Jae Crowder's three-pointer.Butler, meanwhile had started smoothly, going five-from-five in the first quarter to move into double figures.Despite Miami's defensive efforts, the Lakers were still able to carve open a series of good looks, only for off-target shooting to let them down.Nevertheless the Lakers had inched into a two-point lead at half-time at 49-47.In the third quarter, James' shooting from distance improved, his first three-pointer of the night coming with a 29-foot effort to put the Lakers ahead at 55-54.A Danny Green bucket was followed by a driving layup from James and the Lakers had suddenly moved into a 59-54 lead.James made another long-range three shortly afterward to put the Lakers 62-57 up with 6:44 left in the third.Davis's first three-pointer of the game from 28 feet put the Lakers seven points clear with two minutes left in the third.The Los Angeles big man closed the quarter with four free throws to leave the Lakers five points clear heading into the fourth.The Lakers maintained that advantage for much of the fourth quarter.Tyler Herro's three-point jump shot cut the Lakers lead to one point at 76-75, but three free throws from Markieff Morris followed by a superb fadeaway from James stretched the Los Angeles cushion to six points midway through the fourth.Butler raised Miami's hopes after tying it at 83-83, but the Lakers pulled away with Caldwell-Pope's three-pointer transition followed by a layup to make it 95-88 with two minutes left on the clock.Rajon Rondo's layup was then followed by a Davis crucial three-pointer with 39.5 seconds left which sealed the win. LeBron James scored 28 points as the Los Angeles Lakers moved to within one win of a 17th NBA championship on Tuesday with a 102-96 victory over the Miami Heat.Humbled by Miami in game three on Sunday, James and the Lakers came roaring back in a hard-fought defensive battle that was finely balanced until Los Angeles pulled away in the closing minutes.The win leaves the Lakers 3-1 up in the best-of-seven series, meaning they can clinch the championship with victory in game five in Orlando on Friday."It felt like both teams were desperate, understanding the situation they had put themselves in," James said afterwards."Trying to get every extra possession, execute offensively, not to make mistakes defensively, that's what it was all about."James started slowly but clicked in the second half to lead the scoring while providing eight assists and hauling down 12 rebounds.Anthony Davis meanwhile finished with 22 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with a vital 15 point contribution.Caldwell-Pope's tally included a three-pointer and a layup in the closing stages that put the Lakers seven points ahead with two minutes remaining.Davis then drained only his second three-pointer of the night with 39.5 seconds left on the clock to give the Lakers a 100-91 lead and effectively seal the contest.Butler, the 40-point hero of Miami's win on Sunday, was restricted to 22 points, frustrated throughout by a commanding defensive display from Davis."He challenges me every night, I challenge him every night," James said of Davis. "We have to do things to help our team win, defensively, and offensively, and he did that tonight â he was spectacular."Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the game had been decided in key moments in the closing stages."There was some moments of truth there at the end, and probably the bottom line is they won those moments of truth," Spoelstra said."It came down to making plays.

On my level, it's impossible to keep that level of consistency," said Swiatek, who broke the 159th-ranked Trevisan six times."I just stayed, like, really down-to-earth and really positive. I did that pretty well," she said.World number 131 Podoroska, who had never won a Grand Slam main draw match before the tournament, became the first qualifier in the Open era to reach the women's last four at Roland Garros.Swiatek, ranked 54th, is also through to her first major semi-final and cited the success of Osaka, who captured her third Grand Slam title last month, as a factor in her breakout performance."It was inspiring," Swiatek said of Osaka's return to form in New York after an indifferent 18 months for the Japanese star."I also know I can do better sometimes. I just kept working. Naomi is a good example of a player that just did the right work, and result was the effect of that."Podoroska stunned third seed Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-4 and joined exclusive company as only the third female qualifier to make the last four of a Grand Slam.Podoroska will now attempt to become the first qualifier in history to advance to the final of any of the four majors.Alexandra Stevenson reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1999 while Christine Dorey achieved a similar run at the 1978 Australian Open. "My dream is to be number one. That will never change," said Podoroska, whose only other Grand Slam appearance came at the 2016 US Open.""I don't want to wake up," added Podoroska, the first Argentine woman to reach a major semi-final since Paola Suarez in Paris in 2004. Gabriela Sabatini, the 1990 U.S. Open winner, is the country's only women's Grand Slam singles champion.Meanwhile, Argentine and 12th seed Diego Schwartzman defeated U.S. Open champion and third seed Dominic Thiem in a five-hour epic to reach the Roland Garros semi-finals, his first ever Grand Slam last-four appearance.The 28-year-old Schwartzman triumphed 7-6 (7/1), 5-7, 6-7 (6/8), 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 and will face either 12-time champion Rafael Nadal or Italian teenager Jannik Sinner for a place in the final.It was one marathon too many for Thiem, the runner-up in Paris for the last two years, who had needed five sets and three and a half hours to down world number 239 Hugo Gaston in the fourth round.Schwartzman's success came on the same day that compatriot Nadia Podoroska, the world 131st, reached the last-four of the women's singles."Dominic is one of the great players. He is my best friend and I have a lot of respect for him," said Schwartzman. "So this win is very important for me. In the second and third sets, I was going a little crazy and I was screaming at myself because I had so many chances."But, come on, I deserved to win tonight," added Schwartzman who defeated Nadal in the Rome quarter-finals on the eve of the French Open.Thiem had been attempting to reach a fifth successive semi-final in Paris.However, despite crunching 65 winners to his opponent's 47, he committed 81 unforced errors in a match which featured 19 breaks of serve and at five hours and eight minutes was the second longest of the tournament.Iga Swiatek said she drew inspiration from U.S Open winner Naomi Osaka after sweeping into the semi-finals of the French Open on Tuesday by ending the run of her opponent, Italian qualifier Martina Trevisan.The Polish teenager followed up her emphatic win over top seed Simona Halep by defeating Trevisan 6-3, 6-1 to set up a meeting with Argentina's Nadia Podoroska."I just knew that I'm not going to play as perfect as with Simona.

In the second and third sets, I was going a little crazy and I was screaming at myself because I had so many chances."But, come on, I deserved to win tonight," added Schwartzman who defeated Nadal in the Rome quarter-finals on the eve of the French Open.Thiem had been attempting to reach a fifth successive semi-final in Paris.However, despite crunching 65 winners to his opponent's 47, he committed 81 unforced errors in a match which featured 19 breaks of serve and at five hours and eight minutes was the second longest of the tournament.The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) announced on Monday that the Chinese cities of Weihai and Zhengzhou will host the upcoming #RESTART series in November.The event series, which will represent the return of international table tennis after a coronavirus-forced hiatus since March, includes ITTF's three signature events â the Women's World Cup, Men's World Cup and Finals.According to the ITTF, both the Women's World Cup (November 8-10) and Men's World Cup (November 13-15) will be held in Weihai, east China's Shandong Province.With a 4,000-seat capacity, Weihai Nanhai Olympic Center will host the doubles events.

"Roger this morning just confirmed publicly he'll be here," said Tiley in a video conference on Sunday. If Federer shows up at the Melbourne Park by then, it will mark his Grand Slam comeback after a prolonged injury break. In February, the 20-time Grand Slam champion had an arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, which led to him skipping the Dubai, Indian Wells, Bogota, Miami and the French Open. In June, he made a follow-up decision, announcing he would be missing the rest of the season due to a setback during rehabilitation and an additional arthroscopic procedure that followed. "I plan to take the necessary time to be 100 percent ready to play at my highest level," said Federer in a statement on Twitter back then. As revealed by his coach Severin Luthi in a September's interview, Federer has been committed to making a return at Grand Slam tournaments next year and there are plans to begin to take to the court in early October. The last tour-level tournament Federer played was the Australian Open in January this year, where he lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the semifinals. The 2020 Australian Open was the only Grand Slam tournament of the season that was not affected by the coronavirus pandemic; however, going forward, the event has to gear up with all necessary safety measures against the COVID-19."Bubbles" in cities across Australia will be established to accommodate players arriving early, providing them with a safe environment leading up to the Grand Slam."(Players) will have two weeks of quarantine that they will do in cities around Australia, and for those two weeks, we're creating a bubble from the hotel to the courts in a training environment," said the tournament's director Craig Tiley. "By then, we expect the border to be completely open, and we can move from city to city and then come down to Melbourne for the Australian Open for the last two weeks of January."According to Tiley, the tournament will allow up to 50 percent of the public for games. This is significant progress in comparison with this year's U.S. Open, which was played without fans, and the ongoing French Open allows only a handful of spectators.It will also pose a big challenge for tournament organizers as the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, accounts for 90 percent of Australia's 894 COVID-19-related deaths, and is witnessing a recent rise in the number of cases. (Cover image: Roger Federer of Switzerland plays a backhand in his semi-final match against Novak Djokovic of Serbia on day eleven of the 2020 Australian Open at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, January 30, 2020. /VCG)After an injury setback that kept him out for most of the 2020 season, Roger Federer will finally return to competitive tennis at the 2021 Australian Open, slated to start on January 18, 2021. According to the tournament's director and CEO of Tennis Australia Craig Tiley, the Swiss tennis great confirmed he is participating.

"I've worked really hard during the time off and I feel eager to compete and represent this incredible club." The arrival of left-back Telles from Porto for 13.5 million pounds ($23.85 million) is arguably even more important to aid a United defense that has conceded 11 goals in three Premier League games to start the season. "He is a player we have been tracking for some time and his performances over the past few years are exactly what we are looking for," said Solskjaer on the Brazilian international. Thomas Partey has been a long-term target for the Gunners, who have reportedly matched his 50-million-euro buyout clause to bolster their threadbare midfield options. The Ghanian has made 188 appearances for the Spanish giants and was part of the Atletico sides that reached the 2016 Champions League final and beat Arsenal on the way to winning the Europa League in 2018. Uruguayan international Lucas Torreira is expected to go the other way from Arsenal to Atletico on a season-long loan deal. Arsenal have made an impressive start to the season, winning three of their opening four Premier League games, as they aim to return to the Champions League next season for the first time in five years. However, the Londoners have been short in central midfield with Mesut Ozil and Matteo Guendouzi, who has joined Hertha Berlin on a season-long loan, frozen out by Mikel Arteta. Premier League table-toppers Everton signed center-back Ben Godfrey for a reported initial fee of 25 million pounds. Europe's giants busy on transfer final day. Juventus secured one of the hottest properties in Italian football as Federico Chiesa joined from Fiorentina on a two-year loan deal worth 10 million euros with an obligation to buy if certain conditions are met for a further 40 million. English defender Chris Smalling returned to Roma on a permanent deal from Manchester United for 15 million euros after impressing during a loan spell last season. French midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko has also returned to Serie A, joining Napoli on loan from Chelsea. Bayern Munich added a trio of new players as Douglas Costa returned to the Allianz Arena for a second spell on loan from Juventus. The European champions also signed former PSG striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting on a one-year deal and Bouna Sarr from Marseille. However, Barcelona's financial problems meant they could not agree deals for Lyon's Memphis Depay or Manchester City defender Eric Garcia, as the Catalan club revealed 97 million euro losses for the past season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Manchester United swooped for Edinson Cavani, Alex Telles and Amad Diallo on Monday, but Arsenal are expected to complete the biggest deal of transfer deadline day with the arrival of Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey. United were under the spotlight to respond to a humiliating 6-1 home defeat to Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday. Dutch international midfielder Donny van de Beek had been the only addition to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad of the window prior to Monday. Cavani, 33, has been a free agent since leaving Paris Saint-Germain in June and signed a one-year deal with the option for a second season. The Uruguayan scored 200 goals in seven seasons in the French capital to become the club's all-time top goalscorer. "Manchester United is one of the greatest clubs in the world, so it is a real honor to be here," said Cavani.

It will also be his 11th in a row in Paris. He had a heart-stopping moment in the first set when he stretched for a forehand and was unable to avoid seeing the ball accidentally hit a line judge. The incident came just weeks after he was defaulted at the U.S. Open for swiping at a ball which felled a line judge standing behind him, but he was not penalized this time. Djokovic will next face Spain's 17th seed Pablo Carreno Busta, who claimed a 6-2 7-5 6-2 victory over 22-year-old German wildcard Daniel Altmaier. Meanwhile, Stefanos Tsitsipas reached the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for the second time as he brushed aside Grigor Dimitrov 6-3 7-6(9) 6-2. 19-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner, the first man to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals on debut since 12-time champion Rafa Nadal in 2005, will take on the King of Clay on Tuesday.  U.S. Open winner Dominic Thiem will also be in action on Tuesday, facing Rome finalist Diego Schwartzman for a place in the semi-finals. On the women's court, American fourth seed Sofia Kenin recovered from a wobbly start to reach the quarter-finals with a 2-6 6-2 6-1 victory over Franceâs Fiona Ferro. (With input from agencies)Novak Djokovic racked up his 35th win of 2020 and a place in the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the 14th time with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 win over Russia's Karen Khachanov on Monday. The world No.1, chasing a second title in Paris and 18th career Grand Slam, has yet to drop a set in the tournament, losing just 25 games in four rounds. "It was a tight match and I am happy to win in straight sets," said the Serb, who has now reached 47 quarter-finals at the Slams.

a rare scene as most sports leagues in the country still limit the audience to a moderate amount. First played in 2007, the charity basketball game was led by the country's iconic basketball legend Yao Ming's YAO Foundation and was aimed at promoting the development of physical education in China's rural regions as well as reuniting society through sport. This year, it set out with a more important mission as it was deliberately staged in Wuhan to pass on the "spirit of sports" and inject energy and passion into the city and local people. Medical staff who worked on the frontline fighting the coronavirus were part of the lineup and a special ceremony was held before the game to pay tribute to the heroes who fought COVID-19. Celebrities such as China's first Winter Olympics gold medalist Yang Yang, renowned news commentator Bai Yansong, actor and philanthropist Pu Cunxin attended the event to leverage their influence and show their support to the cause. The Yao Foundation Charity Game originated from a post-game talk Yao Ming had with former NBA guard Steve Nash, with Nash proposing charity games as a way to raise funds for China's various youth charities. Ten of these games have been held since the first in 2007. "You feel the sense of achievement when each year's Charity Game successfully concludes," said Yao Ming. "As it goes however, I realized that it transformed into some responsibilities and something you can't live without."In 2012, the Yao Foundation Hope Primary School Basketball Season, a project aimed at providing more teenagers in underprivileged regions with the opportunities and resources to play basketball was launched. As of 2019, the foundation had sent out 2,240 volunteers, and almost 1.15 million schoolchildren in rural areas have benefited from the program.The focus on prioritizing children's physical education and development through sports also got passed on to the charity game as, starting in 2013, a special third quarter was designated to feature children players from primary schools. Zhang Jiacheng, the remarkable one-armed teenage basketballer, joined other primary school kids in the Sunday's game and took the event to a climax with his impressive basketball skills. In the end, the Chinese Star Team led by the Chinese national basketball head coach Du Feng overcame the special team comprised of medical staff together with foreign players and entertainment stars 122-107. (Cover image: China's basketball national team player Kyranbek Makan celebrates after scoring during the Yao Foundation charity game in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, October 4, 2020. /VCGBasketball and other sports stars, medical workers, celebrities as well as local children contributed to a memorable charity basketball game on Sunday night in Wuhan to together boost the city's confidence in the post-pandemic era. More than 7,500 cheered the players on at the stadium -

And football, as I said, is a bridge between China and the rest of the world. Everyone plays football."Expanding on that theme, Liu said: "China is still open. And the development of Chinese football needs help from external stakeholders like the AFC (Asian Football Confederation), FIFA and also other federations as well, and other leagues as well.""We are definitely going to carry on with that kind of partnership, working with all the international governing bodies, brands and stakeholders," he added.China are 76th in the FIFA rankings and their chances of reaching the Qatar 2022 World Cup are in the balance, underlining how far they have to go to reach the top.But speaking in Suzhou, where the Chinese Super League is in a "bubble" to thwart the coronavirus, Liu said that failing to qualify will not deter the country from its long-term goals."To win a spot (in Qatar) means a lot to the Chinese, to the country and also the Chinese football community because that boosts the confidence and gives motivation to every stakeholder and to the football community to contribute more to the development of Chinese football," he said."If we fail, you might have a short-term setback, but the president of the central government understands football and that developing football is a process."Along with building a football infrastructure and overhauling grassroots, school and youth systems, the CSL is a crucial part of the determination to be a superpower in the sport.The league made headlines in recent years when a series of well-known foreign players â along with coaches â arrived on generous contracts and for inflated transfer fees.However, the CFA has since introduced measures such as a salary cap so that the largesse is redirected towards developing young Chinese players."We want to be one of the top leagues in Asia, for sure, which we probably already are, but the benchmark is not supposed to be big spending," said Liu. "It's about sustainability."Liu conceded that Oscar and other overseas stars, such as fellow Brazilians Hulk and Paulinho, have boosted the CSL's profile."But has that (expensive foreigners) helped the development of the local players? That's our question mark," he said.Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman picked up where he left off last season with two goals in a 4-0 home rout of Atletico Madrid on Wednesday as the holders got the defense of their Champions League campaign off to a winning start.Coman, whose header settled last season's Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) just 59 days ago in Lisbon, scored Bayern's opening goal, created their second and claimed their fourth behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena."We played very well, I am very happy with my two goals," Coman told Sky Sports."The winning goal in last season's final is a good motivator, but it's in the past now and we have fresh goals this season." Coman saved his best for last with a superb effort, turning the Atletico defense inside out before firing home on 72 minutes.Goals by midfielders Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso, who produced an unstoppable long-range strike from outside the box, added to Atletico's misery in Munich.The defeat was the joint heaviest Atletico has suffered under Diego Simeone, rivaling the 4-0 drubbing dished out at Dortmund almost exactly two years ago.Real Madrid made an embarrassing start in the Champions League on Wednesday as Shakhtar Donetsk pulled off a shock 3-2 win away to 13-time winners Real Madrid in their Champions League Group B opener on Wednesday, despite the Ukrainian side missing 10 players due to injuries and COVID-19.Strikes from Tete and Manor Solomon, either side of a Raphael Varane own-goal, gave the Ukrainian champions a shock lead at the interval and while Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior pulled goals back, Madrid fell short.Fede Valverde thought he had grabbed an equalizer in injury time but his deflected shot was ruled out after VAR showed Vinicius was offside.La Liga champions Madrid, meanwhile, reflected on a second consecutive home defeat after losing 1-0 at their Alfredo di Stefano stadium to promoted Cadiz on Saturday, further denting their confidence ahead of the 'Classico' at Barcelona in three days' time."In the first half we were not worthy of this competition," said Madrid midfielder Modric."It's obvious we need to improve, we lacked confidence today, especially in the first half, but we have to move on, we can't waste any time regretting what has happened."Coach Zidane had insisted ahead of the game that he was not looking to the trip to Barca's Camp Nou but rested several big names against Shakhtar, choosing not to risk captain Sergio Ramos and starting without Toni Kroos and attacking talisman Karim Benzema."I think Madrid underestimated us but we showed our football and our style," said Shakhtar's Korniienko.Romelu Lukaku scored twice, including a last-gasp equalizer, to rescue a 2-2 draw for Inter Milan in their Champions League opener against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday.Lukaku put Inter ahead after 49 minutes in the San Siro only for the Bundesliga club to hit back with a 63rd-minute Ramy Bensebaini penalty and a Jonas Hofmann strike six minutes from time.But Lukaku had the last word sending the ball in from close range in the final minute.Manchester City came from behind to make a winning start in Champions League Group C on Wednesday with a 3-1 victory over Porto at the Etihad Stadium."If I'm being honest, we are struggling at the moment," said City's German midfielder Gundogan."Fernandinho went off at the end, we have players playing in different positions. I am not 100 percent there because I had Covid, we are not all at the same moment."That is the challenge for this season, it's not going to end for a while," he added.Liverpool proved they can cope without Virgil van Dijk as Nicolas Tagliafico's own goal sealed a 1-0 win at Ajax in the opening game of their Champions League campaign on Wednesday (October 21).Critics have claimed Liverpool will struggle without Van Dijk, but Brazilian midfielder Fabinho filled in impressively alongside Joe Gomez at the heart of the defense."It was a good enough performance to win the game, which at moments was pretty wild. It was not one of our sunny shiny world class football days. It was not perfect but the boys fought like crazy," said a more satisfied Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp afterwards.(With input from agencies)Australia's Adam Scott, the winner of 14 PGA Tour titles, withdrew from the U.S. PGA Zozo Championship on Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19. The 40-year-old from Adelaide was going to make his first start since sharing 38th at last month's U.S. Open. Instead, he will begin a self-isolation period under health and safety protocols. Scott will be hoping to get well in time to compete at the Masters, which was moved to November 12-15 in this year's coronavirus-disrupted schedule. Scott, ranked 15th, took his most recent U.S. PGA triumph in February at Riviera. American Jim Herman, the first alternate, replaced Scott in the Zozo field, which tees off Thursday in the opening round at Sherwood Country Club. Also missing from the Zozo field is world No. 1 Dustin Johnson, who tested positive for COVID-19 before last week's CJ Cup at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. Johnson, still feeling low on energy, plans to play next at the Houston Open the week before the Masters. Since the PGA Tour restarted in mid-June following a COVID-forced shutdown, officials have made several attempts to bring back fans but each time they aborted efforts over health and safety concerns. The next two events on the PGA Tour schedule, the Bermuda Championship and Houston Open, plan to allow a limited number of fans. (With input from agencies)Manchester United posted a 23-million-pound ($30 million) loss for the financial year to June 30 as revenues fell due to the coronavirus pandemic and a lack of Champions League football. The fresh spike in COVID-19 cases across Europe is likely to further delay the return of supporters, hurting income from matchday ticket and catering sales, as well as museum tours for the bigger clubs. "Our top priority is to get fans back into the stadium safely and as soon as possible," said United Executive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward. Premier League clubs last week rejected plans put forward by Liverpool and Manchester United for radical changes to the English game's structure and finances and said they would conduct their own review. The Red Devils' wage bill fell by nearly 50 million pounds because player wages fell after the club failed to qualify for the Champions League and because high earners such as Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku were offloaded.United, who have made a mixed start to the new English Premier League season on the pitch, said revenue in the year ended June 30 fell by 19 percent to 509 million pounds, with some fixtures being delayed beyond that date. It gave no financial forecast for the current year.Meanwhile, net debt rose by 10 percent to 474.1 million pounds at the end of June compared with the end of March.The 20-time English champions said the impact of the coronavirus crisis on revenue has been partially offset by lower matchday costs and reduced travel due to the three-month suspension of matches from March to June. (With input from agencies)The virtual World Press Briefing (WPB) for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games kicked off on Monday.The four-day conference, held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has attracted over 400 representatives to tune in including those from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), National Paralympic Committees (NPCs), International Federations (IFs), and worldwide media, among other organizations.Organized by the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee (BOCOG), the online press briefing is an opportunity for stakeholders to familiarize themselves with the ongoing preparations leading up to the Games. Taking into considerations the inability to carry out on-site tours, the conference will take advantage of simulation technology to present the construction and progress, spatial layout, and vehicles and personnel flow designs of the venues. Fifteen functional areas including media operations, venue constructions, registrations, accommodations, transport as well as securities will be touched upon. "Quality services for media organizations are an integral part of our work. We give high priority to media operations and will honor our bid commitments. We have done and will continue to do everything necessary to meet the pre-Games and Games-time needs of the media for Games coverage," Zhang Jiandong, executive vice president of the BOCOG said in his address.Zhang went on to express confidence in Beijing's smooth preparations for the Games despite the challenges brought by the coronavirus and vowed to provide "comprehensive, efficient and convenient" media services.This world press briefing is the first under the watch of Lucia de Montanarella, who was named IOC Media Operations chief in January."I think that the commitment of Beijing 2022 trying to deliver high standard services and facilities to the media is testified by the table that we see, with the top management of BOCOG participating at the opening of this world press briefing," Montanarella said during her opening remarks."It means a lot to the worldwide media to know that BOCOG gives the interests of the media such a high priority in their organization."(Cover image: Beijing 2022 World Press Briefing is held online in Beijing to brief the stakeholders worldwide about the ongoing preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics, Beijing, October 19, 2020. /Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee)(With input from Xinhua news agency)On Chinese social media platforms, video uploaders usually would like to give the title "Foreigners are less series" to some parkour footages. That reflects few of the netizens know there is also a group of people in China playing parkour, and this sport could be aesthetic but not only thrilling.Mucun, born in the 90s in Chongqing, southwest China, is a full-time extreme sports filmmaker, mainly shooting parkour films. Through his works, people could see many aspects of Chinese parkour.During the college stage, Mucun's major had no relation to sports, but he's interested in street dance and other pop cultures. Once for adding a weapon to his breaking dance arsenal, he went to kungfu society to learn somersault, but then, he was attracted by the alumnus who were also playing parkour there.Having an introverted nature, Mucun just did parkour exercise silently and gradually got in touch with China's core parkour athletes in the following years. At the same time, he started to record the playing and tried to make it better.Putting a sports camera on an athlete's body is a general method of taking parkour shots, but that will easily make the audience dizzy. Thus, an eligible parkour cameraman should know about both â how to play parkour and how to get clear images.Sometimes, shooting parkour film could be, to a certain degree, much tiring than just playing it, as the videographer has to run nearly the same route for many times while controlling the camera, paying attention to terrain, machine, and passengers at the same time.But for Mucun personally, the hardest thing is to communicate with athletes, as most of them have formal jobs, parkour is only their hobby, and it's difficult to organize a project with everyone's schedule suitable. Furthermore, when the shooting comes into a challenge, he has to decide whether to persuade the athlete to continue or not."I'm not a person who's good at communicating, and for these years, I have experienced a lot of up and downs on it, fortunately now, I have some faithful friends to cooperate with," Mucun said.As there's rare full-time parkour filmmakers in China, Mucun plays the roles of producer, director, cinematographer, video editor, and special effects maker in most of his projects, and the loneliness makes his career develop slow.While working alone, it still has benefit as he learns many operations of diverse camera equipment during the process. Now, the main types of his work are pure parkour skill show, documentary, and parkour action movie. Besides, he also did some vlogs and films of other extreme sports.To improve his shooting quality, Mucun now attends professional roller skating class regularly. Even though he has quite flexible work, he often gets up at 5:00 a.m. to edit video and arranges his schedule with full activities to 10:00 p.m.Since his first parkour film Super Tramp winning the Banff China Outdoor Film Fest's Best Cinematography Award, Mucun walks on the road of parkour filmmaking more and more confidently.

For Xu Mengtao, a Chinese aerial skier, turning 30 is just a new start to challenge the impossible, to set new records, and to pursue gold and glory at the Winter Olympics.Editor's note: The article is an edited version of an article which was first published on a WeChat official account named Gong Yi Kan Shi Jie. The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.Given that some major U.S. media and politicians made groundless claims that the novel coronavirus originates in China, blamed and slandered China, even asked for an apology from China, then I have every reason to ask 10 questions for the United States about its origin too. Better still, unlike the U.S., I did a lot homework and will base my questions on international media coverage of COVID-19.Question 1Since the director of the U.S. Centers of Disease Control, Robert Redfield admitted that some Americans seemingly dying from flu were tested positive for the novel coronavirus, can I conclude that those people actually died from the novel coronavirus? Among the 34 million influenza patients, with a death toll of 20,000, how many were misdiagnosed?When did the misdiagnoses start? And did it actually start from August 2019? These questions are so vital that the world is waiting for an explanation from the United States.Question 2When there were some misdiagnoses admitted by U.S. CDC, I'm scratching my head â isn't the U.S. that owns the best medical technologies in the world? Why did that happen?As the ground glass opacity (white patches) can be easily seen in CT scans of the lungs of patients with the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, it should have been an easy thing to separate the cases of COVID-19 and H1N1 flu. But why were there so many misdiagnoses?Well, that reminds me of the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's request of controlling all messaging regard to the coronavirus. Why does the White House call for messaging control? Does the U.S. need to hide something? Are they plotting some conspiracy?Question 3Why did the U.S. withdraw from the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 2001? Why did it try to prevent a monitoring mechanism for the execution of the Convention? Is it standing in the way of developing biological weapon for the U.S.?If not, why are there new biological laboratories in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan? Are those labs for biochemical warfare? It's impossible that they are keeping viruses as pets. If the U.S. is aiming at provoking a biochemical war, who would be the first target then? Also, how about the swine flu outbreak in China last year? The odd thing is that it broke out in different places simultaneously instead of breaking out separately. Why were drones used to poison the pigs? Was the U.S. behind all that? I heard that it was the pork speculators. But that theory makes no sense â since the swine flu killed millions of pigs in China during the same period of time, pork speculators would suffer great loss instead of profits.The best possible answer to that was foreign meddling. I was among those who wondered if the U.S. had anything to do with that and hoped for an explanation.Question 4The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, located on Fort Detrick, Maryland, was shut down in July 2019. Was it because there was a virus leakage incident?Just one month later, there was an influenza outbreak across the country. Were those two things related in any way?Were the misdiagnoses simply cooked up to cover up such secrets? Did that also become a motive for the U.S. to shift the blame to other countries by labeling them as the origin of the novel coronavirus?Was that an epic coincidence or a dirty secret in disguise? Why did the U.S. erase huge number of English news reports on the internet covering the shutdown in March 2020? Is there anything to hide, or is there anything to worry about?Question 5At the 7th Military World Games (October 18-27, 2019) held in Wuhan, why did the U.S. team (369 members) win ZERO gold medal? Did that even look like a reasonable record for the world's leading military power? Did your government do it on purpose?Was anyone among the 369 participants ever (mis)diagnosed with influenza? Was it possible they were carriers of the novel coronavirus?The best thing for the U.S. now is to stop burying its head in the sand and give the 369 people PCT tests to see if they are infected.Question 6Why did the U.S. hold Event 201, a global pandemic exercise in October 2019? Why was the CIA deputy director participating it? Is it because the U.S. has foreseen a highly-infectious virus is about to cause a pandemic? One month later, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were detected in China and there was a pandemic three months later. Probably, it's not just a coincidence.Question 7Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran all reported that many of their first COVID-19 confirmed cases had no exposure history with China but showed connection with the United States. How come?Genetic research shows that the type of novel coronavirus found in China belongs to Group C, but Group A and Group B viruses â Group C's parental and grand parental viruses â are both found in the United States. Why? A Japanese patient was diagnosed with influenza in Hawaii but was tested positive for COVID-19 when he returned to Japan. How to explain that?Some COVID-19 cases in the U.S. had no connection with China whatsoever. So where does it come from?Question 8You've got no reason to deny that the 1918 Pandemic originated within your territory. But you let Spain bear the blame for as long as a century. Don't you feel shame on that?History seems to repeat itself. So, is the U.S. playing the trick again and attempting to label the novel coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus"?Question 9The 1918 Pandemic, causing 1 billion infections, with a death toll "estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million... one of the deadliest epidemics in human history," according to wikipedia, was proven originating in the U.S., but the U.S. has never apologized to the world. So far, the origin of the novel coronavirus is still unknown, but the United States is requiring China for an apology, how ridiculous is that! Just to remind the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic killing 300,000 people also originated in the U.S., and also the same for HIV AIDS. So why not confess to the world?Question 10In movies, the U.S. is fond of playing the role of the world savior. The image of Captain America is one of its most popular symbols. However, in reality, in the face of a disaster like COVID-19, where is Captain America?The U.S. is not doing enough to protect its citizens at home or on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It even attempted to make Japan responsible for Americans on Diamond Princess. How does the U.S. have the brass to do all these and accuse China of being irresponsible?While China bought the world valuable time to battle COVID-19, the U.S. accused China of being passive and lacking transparency. Well, when the White House instructed the CDC to stop tallying the people tested for novel coronavirus, did that count as transparency? When the U.S. government advised its people not to wear masks, was it not being passive? Just too many questions call for the U.S.'s explanations.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.)The 7th Military World Games took place in China's Wuhan from October 18 to 27. In this video, people around the world expressed their feelings about this sports feast.It was yet another bittersweet moment for me as I completed my role in covering the 7th Military World Games.I knew nothing about the games and admittedly had not heard of it prior to attending, but now I takeaway with me something more."Friendship through sports" is the motto of the games, and this really shined through in Wuhan, China. I saw it with my own eyes and felt it with my heart how new friends and connections are forged not just between the army of different countries but also within a country.The military games is, after all, a multi-sport event â 27 sports, in fact. A military Olympics indeed it was. It's the scale of this event and the sense of a "big family" that differentiates it from other individual sports games, many athletes told me.A few things stood out to me in my reporting.First, many of the international athletes I've spoken to have competed worldwide, but it's their very first time in China. So, it was nice to hear what they think and have to say about the country.Second, many of the athletes have their own lives and jobs outside of the military.Cecilia Sjoeholm from Sweden is one of them. She works as a part-time chef in the Swedish Armed Forces."It has given me friendship, and that's the most important thing. I would not have done it for 10 years if it wasn't for my Swedish friends, people I love, and my friends in the naval pentathlon team from around the world. They're friends forever, and that's why it makes this sport so special," she told me.I've seen how the females compete in the naval pentathlon, and boy, it isn't easy. It features five events: an obstacle course, life-saving swimming, utility swimming, seamanship, and an amphibious cross-country race."The core skill in naval pentathlon is the physical strength, the mental stability which is very needed out in the sea when it could be very cold, rainy, you're wet and tired,"  Swedish team captain Joakim Hiertner said.Another naval pentathlon athlete from Poland, Edyta Korczak told me,  "It makes me feel like I have another family. I can compete with them, but we can be best friends. This is the best thing about sports."Military capabilities and sports skills aside, it's also about the way different countries approach the sport.It may be 23-year old Bianca Caruso's first time in China, but she has competed worldwide and with the Chinese for a couple of years now."I think Chinese are really humble sailors. They are really quiet, always focused on what they are doing. I think what we can learn from them is for sure because we Italians are... kind of jokers," she told me.Likewise, Hu Rong from the sailing competition management committee said there is much that the Chinese can learn from international athletes."It's like their love for the sport comes from within, and they do things with feeling. When they align their boats, the 470s, they do it with attention to detail," Hu Rong said. "We Chinese can also learn how to just simply enjoy the process of competing from the international athletes that and their flexibility in changing roles on the boat."Truly, many life lessons can be gained from sports. For example, I learned from Hu Rong that with sailing the most important skill required is adaptability."This is the number one thing I teach my students because when you have the ability to adapt well, you can change your techniques to navigate different environments. In sailing, adaptability can make up for what you lack in physical strength," she said.Meanwhile, a sport you might not have linked to military sports is golf. Hence, the reason I pitched this story.Nicolas Calvet, a golfer from France, told me that golf has many worthwhile life lessons that can be applied to in one's life and job."Golf has given me a lot, personally and in the job because it teaches you to be really humble and to be honest with yourself," Calvet said. "If you make a mistake, it's nobody's fault but yours. And in the military role, if you can't just look at yourself and say that's me; I'm this, and I have this; you can't go anywhere."I am not sure, but I don't think many other sports allow you to spend over 4-5 hours competing with your small group of teammates.As Arjan De Haas from the Netherlands said, "You can talk about their family, about their homes, what they do at home. We're all in the army, but we're in different parts of the army. So, it's nice to talk about it."As the Games come to a close, I think it's important to take a step back and ponder why is there a need to gather military personnel on the field of sports?According to Major Jan-Henrik Baeck, a board member of the International Sports Military Council (CISM), the most important thing for soldiers to have a platform to meet is that they set up new networks."You set up new connections with other people that you have not reached before," Baeck said."For instance, when I go to a competition, I meet some people from China and Korea, and two years later, I'm in an international mission, and I reach my same buddies that I've reached before, and we are on speaking terms directly. So, this is one of the best things with this community."Now, how can I end this piece without mentioning the Athletes' Village! A place where I called my second home in the past two weeks.To be sure, I don't live there, but almost 10-thousand athletes, coaches and officials from over 100 countries did.It was pretty embarrassing that people I met who saw me at some of the games said to me at the village, "Hey Lynn how are your interviews going?" and proceeded to ask others around us if I have interviewed them yet. Well, I call it devotion to the job!My respect for sportsmen and women just went up a notch. Sports can truly shape a person's life for the better as many athletes have told me, and can bring about friendship and camaraderie on and beyond the field.I may not be a professional athlete who travels around the world, but I have my job where I can explore and bring these stories to all of you.And this alone is enough for me. I had a great time covering the 7th Military World Games and I have, along the way, gained many friends globally and learned from their stories.Also, I'm not sure if this already exists, but wouldn't it be nice to have a Journalist World Games perhaps? Gathering journalists of the world in the field of sports? Every profession needs an outlet to let loose and showcase one's talent and passion, after all.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), signed an order on Monday to reward the Chinese athletes and coaches that participated in the 7th Military World Games in Wuhan, central China.Xi pointed out that the Chinese athletes and coaches, as representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force, had fought all out in the competition, sharing friendship and safeguarding peace while vying for sporting achievements and pursuing sportsmanship. Their performances have won honors for the country as well as for the PLA.Xi emphasized that the historic breakthrough by the Chinese delegation in the 7th Military World Games was achieved with the PLA Sports Delegation keeping the instructions of the CMC in their mind and with the goal of "first-class competition and first-class performances."The order called for the Chinese athletes and coaches to cherish the honor without being arrogant, and to look to achieve greater glories in the future. The order also called on the entire army to learn from the Military World Games' Chinese participants, as well as fighting for the goal of strengthening the PLA while striving to develop a world-class army.The 7th Military World Games, the biggest ever "Olympics for the military," closed on Sunday after 10 days of competition, as hosts China collected 133 golds and 239 medals in total, the first time a country has earned over a 100 gold medals.Held from October 18 to 27, the quadrennial event attracted a record number of participants, with nearly 10,000 officers and soldiers from 109 countries competing in 27 sports.Read more:7th Military World Games closes in ChinaAfter a historic 10 days of competition in Wuhan, central China, the 7th Military World Games wrapped up with an exciting closing ceremony with the theme of friendship. Watch my vlog for a closer look at the special night.It all began on one cloudy day in May 2015 when the central Chinese city of Wuhan dropped a bombshell announcing that it had won the bid to host the 2019 Military World Games â a grand gathering of thousands of soldiers from around the world and second only to the Olympics in terms of scale.There were fears that Wuhan might not be up to the task of staging China's most important international sporting event since 2008. In addition, there were serious concerns over whether there would be a clear social and economic rationale for the event that goes beyond simply hosting a limelight-hogging extravaganza.The unyielding support, cooperation and dedication from all levels of government had raised the hopes of the Wuhan organizers, but a race against time to develop and upgrade the city's infrastructure dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the never-ending construction projects grew louder.Fast forward four years and the tables have turned. The 2019 Military World Games concluded gloriously after bedazzling the world with sporting brilliance, unprecedented geographical reach, unwavering promotion of peace and friendship, and unrivaled spectacle of opening and closing ceremonies.Within a span of 10 days, the highlights flowed thick and fast. Under the motto "Share friendship, build up peace," a record 9,308 military personnel from 109 countries and regions graced the stage in Wuhan in a record 27 events. China achieved its best-ever gold medal haul of 133 on the back of thorough preparations, steely commitment and virtuoso performances. With 67 Olympic and world champions turning out for the jamboree, seven world records were smashed and 85 International Military Sports Commission (CISM) affiliated records were broken. CISM President Herve Piccirillo, who was a living embodiment of jollity and cheerfulness at the closing gala on Sunday, showered praise on Wuhan, saying the hosts "have excellently completed the mission" and the Military World Games will leave the city "unparalleled tangible and intangible heritage for the future generations." It evidently helped that so many locals were extremely zealous about the Games, which were truly omnipresent as special banners and flags found their way into every nook and cranny of Wuhan. It was the first time all competitions for the Games were staged in a single city, and to the pleasant surprise of the organizers, the tickets to a host of events became the hottest commodity in Wuhan. The organizers said more than 600,000 tickets were flying off the shelves. The atmosphere within the 5G-powered venues was second to none. From the intensity of the Naval Pentathlon at Mulan to the thrill of the Parachuting at Hannan and the zest of the Orienteering at Jiangxia, exhilarated crowds packed out almost every venue. For the memorable moments in the Wuhan Sports Center, at the Yishan Golf Club or on East Lake, the buzz stood comparison with any sporting event ever held in China.That's due in no small part to over 250,000 volunteers, who are frequently the unsung heroes when it comes to the crunch. The sense of warmth, intelligence, proficiency and humility they brought to long days of performing ordinary tasks in their eye-catching white-and-green uniforms was noteworthy and highly commendable. Their firm belief that they were part of something bigger rubbed off on the rest of the city.By any measure, Wuhan has delivered on its promise of fostering international cooperation and building peace through sport. As Piccirillo said, "Beyond the Games, it is all the Chinese people who are spreading this message of solidarity and peace."Moreover, the newly-built Athletes' Village, stretching over 565,000 square meters, earned rave reviews and successfully served as a bridge between a swathe of different cultures. Sports fields were noted for some endearing interactions among soldiers who merrily traded lapel pins that were made as mementos of each Games. Wuhan also deserves praise for meticulous attention to detail in planning and obsessive focus on efficiency. The smooth performance of its various transport systems provided more than enough insurance during the fortnight when the huge deluge of visitors descended on the metropolis.One thing Wuhan did exceptionally well was to carry out a roadmap that was underpinned by a responsible fiscal strategy. Instead of hosting the Games as an end in itself, the organizers put top priority on its long-term sustainability. From the very beginning, creating a post-Games legacy was at the heart of their planning.  The major infrastructure of the Games was designed and located with future housing and commercial development in mind. Even the Main Media Center, where all furniture and equipment were on loan from contractors, will be turned into a multipurpose gymnasium featuring an indoor ice rink, a fencing hall and an archery training center.Wuhan is fully capitalizing on the opportunity to leverage the Games to accelerate its extraordinary metamorphosis from an economic backwater into an international hub for business and tourism.There is no doubt that hosting the Games significantly bolstered Wuhan's profile and provided timely momentum for the city to start and finish projects that had been deliberated upon for years, including the world's longest double-deck suspension bridge, Yangsigang Yangtze River Bridge, Asia's largest underground urban complex in Optics Valley Square, and multiple new subway lines that spread out throughout the town.The impressive numbers back up that claim. According to Xinhua, over the past three years, Wuhan renovated 1,300 kilometers of its urban roads and saw its metro network reach 330 kilometers in total length. Meanwhile, a staggering 360,000 trees were planted.With its newfound international recognition, proven ability to stage massive sporting events and enormously positive impact on the Chinese psyche, Wuhan has even been touted as one of the potential candidates to host the 2032 Olympics. As described by Piccirillo, "The multiple venues built in line with highest standards in the world can serve any future international sports event that Wuhan may step up to host."For Wuhan observers and local residents, this rosy picture was far beyond their wildest dreams a decade ago. Basking in the success of the 7th Military World Games, Wuhan has immensely elevated its global status, and the social, economic and cultural impacts of the event will reach far beyond the lifespan of two weeks.Today, Wuhan is no longer in the shadows. The days are gone when the city's majestic Yellow Crane Tower and luscious hot dry noodles were almost unheard of outside China. The world is starting to take notice, and this is exactly the kind of publicity that money can't buy.Wuhan, the capital city of central China's Hubei Province, said goodbye to the 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games, the first international military multi-sport event held in China, with a closing ceremony on Sunday night.Col. Dorah Mamby Koita, Secretary General of the International Military Sports Council, presented the Fair Play Award to Col. Bertrand Gebuhrer, chief of the French delegation during the closing ceremonies of the World Military Games Sunday. The award is presented in recognition of sportsmanship, fair play and contributions to promoting the ideals and values of CISM.The 7th CISM Military World Games concluded in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, on Sunday.Team China, also the largest sports group at the Games, topped the medal table with a total of 133 gold medals, 64 silver medals and 42 bronze medals.CGTN takes you through a brief history of the Chinese delegation in military sports.1951 In September, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) founded its first professional sports team, which included football, basketball, volleyball, track and field, swimming, lifting, gymnastics, and other sports as branches. The name, the August First Team or Bayi in Chinese, is because the PLA was founded on August 1, 1927.1978PLA observers attended the 32nd Congress of the International Military Sports Council (CISM), marking China starting its official military sports ties with the world.1981For the first time, the August First military pentathlon team participated in the 30th World Military Pentathlon Championship, and finished eighth among the 13 participating teams. 1982In December, the PLA founded its military sports team based in one of the competitive sports training centers for soldiers. The team focused on five events: shooting, military pentathlon, horse riding in modern pentathlon, fencing and triathlon (including cycling).2016-2018Institutional reforms that aimed at managing and optimizing sports resources implemented according to the PLA deepening reform plan.Under the newly launched Military Sports Training Center, a total of 29 discipline teams were set up. They included shooting, track and field, swimming, basketball, skiing, military pentathlon, and also added military-focused disciplines such as naval pentathlon, aeronautical pentathlon, and orienteering.Clayton Kershaw, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts â the Los Angeles Dodgers stars all shined.Nothing out of the ordinary there, even if the setting was surreal.Baseball's best team during the pandemic-shortened season showed off its many talents in the first World Series game played at a neutral site, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.With the seats mostly empty, Kershaw dominated for six innings, Bellinger and Betts homered and the Dodgers chased a wild Tyler Glasnow in the fifth inning and coasted home in the opener.A crowd limited by the coronavirus to 11,388 at Globe Life Field, the new $1.2-billion home of the Texas Rangers, marked the smallest for baseball's top event in 111 years.Los Angeles hopes to go home with a title that has eluded the Dodgers since 1988 but tried to guard against focusing ahead."It's hard not to think about winning. It's hard not to think about what that might be like," Kershaw said. "Constantly keep putting that in your brain: tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow. And then you do that three more times, and you can think about it all you want."A regular season star with an erratic postseason history, Kershaw looked like the ace who so often stars on midsummer evenings with the San Gabriel Mountains behind him at Dodger Stadium. With these games shifted, the 32-year-old left-hander wound up pitching not far from his off season home in Dallas.The three-time Cy Young Award winner allowed one run and two hits, struck out eight and walked one. He induced 19 swings and misses among his 78 pitches â more than his three previous Series starts combined."You can appreciate and totally see why he's heading to the Hall of Fame one day whenever he's done," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.Kershaw threw nine balls in the first, when he stranded a pair of runners, then threw just nine more over the next three innings."He had a game plan to try to really quiet down things from there and he executed," said Kevin Kiermaier, who ended Kershaw's streak of 13 retired in a row with a fifth-inning homer on a hanging slider that cut the Rays' deficit to 2-1.Kershaw, a five-time ERA champ, improved to 2-2 in the World Series and 12-12 in postseason play, a shadow of his 175-76 regular season record. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts did not pitch him after Game 4 of the NL Championship Series last Thursday."I think we were going to stay away from him in Game 7 just for this particular reason," Roberts said.Game 2 is Wednesday night. The Dodgers, who posted the best record in the majors during the shortened season and showed off all their stars in Game 1, plan to throw a collection of pitchers started by Tony Gonsolin against Rays ace Blake Snell.Eight of the last 10 teams to win Game 1 went on the title, all except the 2016 Indians and 2017 Dodgers.Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP who began the opener with a career .114 batting average in 12 World Series games, had put the Dodgers ahead in the fourth with a two-run homer off Glasnow, having no trouble driving a 98 mph pitch into the Dodgers bullpen in right-center.Bellinger, whose seventh-inning homer put the Dodgers ahead in Game 7 of the NL Championship on Sunday, shuffled his feet, tapping gently as he crossed the plate and celebrated by toe tapping teammates while dancing back to the dugout, a sign he remembered popping his right shoulder during raucous revelry two nights earlier.He capped his evening by leaping at the 6-foot center field wall in the ninth, robbing Austin Meadows of a possible home run."I said it today before the game: If I hit one I'm not touching anybody's arm," Bellinger said. "I'm going straight foot, and it was pretty funny."Betts, brilliant throughout October but slumping at the plate, added his first postseason homer for the Dodgers, an opposite-field solo shot to right in the sixth off Josh Fleming.Betts had two hits, scored two runs and stole two bases in the four-run fifth, when Corey Seager swiped one as Los Angeles became the first team to steal three bases in a Series inning since the 1912 New York Giants in Game 5 against Boston."That's a weak spot of my game, holding runners," Glasnow said. "Has to be something I focus on more in the future. "Betts became the first to hit a home run, steal two bases and score twice in a Series game."Stolen bases are a thing for me. That's how I create runs and create havoc on the basepaths," he said.Los Angeles is in the Series for the third time in four years but seeking its first title since the Kirk Gibson- and Orel Hershiser-led team of 32 years ago. Coming off an unusual LCS of games on seven straight days, the Dodgers planned an all-bullpen outing for the next game.Tampa Bay was held to six hits. Its only previous Series was a five-game loss to Philadelphia in 2008.Glasnow was chased after 4 1/3 innings with an ominous pitching line that included three hits, six runs, six walks and eight strikeouts. He threw a career-high 112 pitches and became the first to walk six or more in a series game since Edwin Jackson of St. Louis in Game 4 of 2011. Glasnow went to three-ball counts on 12 of 23 batters.Los Angeles expanded its lead to 4-1 in the fifth, when Cash left Glasnow in to face left-handed-hitting Max Muncy with runners at the corners. Muncy hit a one-hopper to first baseman Yandy DÃ­az with the infield in, and Betts beat a strong but slightly offline throw with a headfirst slide past catcher Mike Zunino.Will Smith finished Glasnow with an RBI single, and Chris Taylor and pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez followed with run-scoring singles off Ryan Yarbrough for a 6-1 lead.Justin Turner and Muncy doubled on consecutive pitches in the sixth.Pinch-hitter Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs in the seventh against Victor Gonzalez, who snagged Zunino's line drive and doubled Brosseau off second base for an inning-ending double play.After a regular season played without fans, MLB resumed selling tickets with a limited amount for the NLCS at Globe Life and kept that up by allowing about 28 percent of capacity to be filled at the 40,518-seat ballpark, where the roof was open. The crowd was widely dispersed throughout and was the smallest for the Series since 10,535 attended Game 6 between the Pirates and Tigers at Detroit's Bennett Park in 1909, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.An overwhelming majority of fans wore Dodger blue."They're everywhere. They always come out," Kershaw said. "And so for as much as a game as we would have liked it to have been at Dodger Stadium and the 56,000 chanting, after everything that's gone on this season, to have 10-, 11,000 people in the stands and a good bit of them being Dodger fans is pretty cool."Clayton Kershaw, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts â the Los Angeles Dodgers stars all shined.Nothing out of the ordinary there, even if the setting was surreal.Baseball's best team during the pandemic-shortened season showed off its many talents in the first World Series game played at a neutral site, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.With the seats mostly empty, Kershaw dominated for six innings, Bellinger and Betts homered and the Dodgers chased a wild Tyler Glasnow in the fifth inning and coasted home in the opener.A crowd limited by the coronavirus to 11,388 at Globe Life Field, the new $1.2-billion home of the Texas Rangers, marked the smallest for baseball's top event in 111 years.Los Angeles hopes to go home with a title that has eluded the Dodgers since 1988 but tried to guard against focusing ahead."It's hard not to think about winning.

According to ESPN, Bjorkgren signed a multi-year deal with the Pacers.Bjorkgren, 45, was the assistant under Nick Nurse, named the NBA Coach of the Year last season in the Toronto Raptors. He also had years of experience coach NBA D-League teams."We are very pleased and excited to have Nate as our new coach. This was an extensive and thorough search, and when we reached the conclusion, we felt strongly Nate is the right coach for us at the right time. He comes from a winning background, has experienced championship success, is innovative, and his communication skills, along with his positivity, are tremendous. We all look forward to a long, successful partnership in helping the Pacers move forward," said Kevin Pritchard, president of basketball operations of the Pacers, in a statement."I am honored to take on the role as head coach of the Indiana Pacers. This is something I have prepared for during my career. I want to thank Kevin, Chad (Buchanan), Kelly (Krauskopf), Larry Bird, Donnie Walsh, and Herb and Steve Simon for this opportunity. I also want to thank Nick Nurse for giving me my first professional coaching job 14 years ago. I'm looking forward to working with this great team to achieve our goal as NBA Champions."Bjorkgren's creative thinking began to draw attention after he suggested Nurse use "Box-1 defense" on Stephen Curry in Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the Raptors and the Golden State Warriors last year. The ingenious move worked as Curry failed to even take one attempt in the last quarter of G2. In the end, the Raptors defeated the Warriors 4-2 to win their first NBA Championship in franchise history.Of course, that does not mean Bjokgren's new job will be easy at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Pacers made the NBA playoffs for the fifth straight time in the past 2019-20 season and were eliminated for the fifth time in a row. Moreover, they were swept out in both 2019 and 2020.The Pacers wanted breakthroughs, and they were capable of getting it if they were healthy â injuries had been haunting the team for years. Meanwhile, Bjorkgren may have a better chance of leading the Pacers to achieve a breakthrough if he can help Victor Oladipo find the best himself back. The 28-year-old two-time All-Star guard still has one year left of his contract with the deal, and he already rejected the four-year, 80-million-U.S.-dollar contract extension offer by the Pacers. If he can fully recover from injury and reproduces his incredible performance two years ago in the new season, it will benefit both himself and the Pacers.The Indiana Pacers have appointed Nate Bjorkgren as their new head coach, announced the team on Tuesday.

The English top league was said to have five candidates and it's unclear which of the "Big 6" will be left behind.Kleinman said that the financiers are trying to raise a $6 billion funding package and are negotiating with JP Morgan. FIFA reportedly backed the plan but has denied any involvement."FIFA does not wish to comment and participate in any speculation about topics which come up every now and then and, for which, institutional structures and regulatory frameworks are well in place at national, European and global level," said a spokesperson of the global football governing body.Kleinman's source described the plan as "potentially the most important development in world club football for decades."If the reports about the plan are true, in order to compete with the UEFA Champions League, which is also the most valuable football event in the world, the European Premier League will offer hundreds of millions of pounds of fees for founding teams. Its games will take place during the seasons of other national leagues and each team will play at least 30 games on a format of round-robin home and away fixtures.

rule violation after a World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal dismissed charges brought against her for registering four "whereabouts failures."The 22-year-old, who won gold at the World Championships in Doha last year, was charged and provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) in June.According to World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules, any combination of three whereabouts failures â filing failures or missed tests â within a 12-month period by an athlete constitutes an anti-doping violation.Athletes guilty of whereabouts failures could face two-year bans or a minimum of one year depending on the degree of fault.In Naser's case, the disciplinary tribunal upheld three of the four AIU charges against her â a filing failure effective Jan. 1, 2019 and two missed tests, on March 12 last year and January 24 this year.However, the tribunal found in Naser's favor with regard to a third alleged missed test on April 12, 2019, which resulted in the charges being dismissed because her three whereabouts failures did not occur within a 12-month rolling period."This was a case very much on the borderline and we hope the athlete will learn from the experience and heed the AIU's warnings," the tribunal said in a statement.(Cover image: Salwa Eid Naser wins the women's 400 meters final at the IAAF World Athletics Championships in Doha, Qatar, October 3, 2019. /VCG)World

Weihai, east China's Shandong Province, between November 8 and 10.This rule change is no good news for China, which sent Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha to attend the event. Chen and Sun are the No. 1 and No. 3 seeds based on their current world rankings. Meanwhile, China's biggest rival Mima Ito from Japan, is the No. 2 seed. That means Chen and Ito will be in different divisions, but there's no telling which division Sun will end in.If Chen and Sun meet before the final match, one of them has to go, and that will be in Ito's favor. Both Chen and Sun hold an advantageous record over Ito in the past competitions. The last time Chen met Ito happened at the Qatar Open in March. Chen came back from a 1-0 trail and defeated Ito 4-1 in the women's singles final match, winning the gold and claiming her fourth straight victory over Ito.Sun does not fear Ito either. She achieved a 3-2 win over Ito, coming back from a 2-0 trail at the ITTF Team World Cu last year. Sun also beat Ito 4-1 in the ITTF German Open in last October. Ito even shed tears after the loss.All three will make their singles World Cup debut in November, and each of them is eying for the first tile of the event in her career. The competition for Olympic attendance in Tokyo is extremely intense among Chinese players. Both Chen and Sun need good performance at the World Cup for their favors.The International Table Tennis Federation (ITTF) announced this week that players would not be separated at the draw of the coming Women's World Cup in Weihai, east China's Shandong Province, between November 8 and 10.This rule change is no good news for China, which sent Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha to attend the event.

As the event is the first since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, the coach said the squad is focusing on their weaknesses, including by increasing strength training. "We work on the weakness or weak events, such as vault or floor exercise, everything will not happen overnight, but the team works hard together every day."Reflecting on his coaching accomplishments around the world, the 52-year-old said he enjoyed coming back to China and was honored to have a chance to guide the Chinese women's squad. "This great team has a lot of good traditions, we just have to keep building on physical ability."The Beijing native also shared several aspects of his approach to coaching. "I think there is no magic word to any sport," the World Cup winner said. "The hard work has to be done every single day. I think the hard part is keeping the athletes healthy, and also enjoying their hard work. I think that's the art of coaching."Coach Qiao is also looking to help the women's squad earn medals for China. When asked what he want to be remembered for most as a coach, he answered he wanted his athletes to learn skills to sustain them through life. "I can educate our next generation to not only learn the skills of gymnastics or winning gold medals, but also skills for life."China's National Gymnastics Championships continues in south China's Guangdong Province. Before the event started, Qiao Liang, the head coach of the women's national team, talked with CGTN's Sports Scene about the team's preparations, as well as his coaching philosophy and his expectations for the contest in the city of Zhaoqing."The hard work in the foundation of this team, we have a strong, good supporting system, and also we have wonderful coaches," Qiao said.

Deng finished the climb in 6.987 seconds, but Niu was even faster to reach the summit in 6.819 seconds. Both beat the world record (7.088 seconds) for women's speed climbing set by Aries Susanti Rahayu from Indonesia. However, since there were no officials from the International Federation of Sport Climbing to monitor the event because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the performance of Niu will not be recognized as a new world record.At the beginning of this month, snooker legend Stephen Hendry came out of retirement after eight years and accepted an invitational tour card to compete on the World Snooker Tour for at least the next two seasons. Previously, the seven-time world champion, who is nicknamed "King of Crucible" and "Emperor of Snooker," spoke to Sports Scene's Wang Dong.The 51-year-old retired in 2012, having slipped out of the World Championship at the quarter-final stage, and also making a 147 break in the event that year. Hendry felt that he might have played longer, but he left public because he wasn't playing well enough to win. "For me, the whole pleasure of playing snooker is to win, when I didn't have the success, I didn't enjoy that much," Hendry said in the interview.Even though the Scot has been away from playing on the main circuit, he has remained around the game as his passion remains in the sport. He's working as a commentator and ambassador for snooker around the world, especially in China. He emphasized that China is one of his favorite places and a big part of his career. He also gave thanks to all his Chinese fans for their support, saying he was flattered by the nickname "Emperor of Snooker."Hendry returned as a player on the 2020 World Seniors Snooker Championship in August, and a link-up with renowned coach Stephen Feeney has spurred him on to have another crack at the main tour. After receiving the invitational tour card, his return seems more realizable this time.When asked his assessment of current players, the snooker legend praised Ding Junhui, who is considered the most successful Asian player in history. "Ding and O'Sullivan have the best cue ball control", the Scot said. "I love Ding as a player, his game is incredible. He should have already won the World Championship because he has everything in his game, but I question if he has the hunger."He also shared his thoughts about Ronnie O'Sullivan's record-breaking success over him. "I wouldn't be happy, I have to be honest if Ronnie broke my record, but he still has to win another two," Hendry said of "The Rocket." The 44-year-old regained the title in Sheffield and is now only one behind Hendry's record seven world titles.Yan Xiaonan is one of the only two ranked Chinese female mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). She currently ranks 10th under the dominance of UFC women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili and, next month at UFC 253, Yan will face Claudia Gadelha from Brazil, with a victory likely to earn her a championship ticket.To earn her #10 position, the 31-year-old beat Poland's Karolina Kowalkiewicz by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night Auckland on February 23 this year.Yan's half-year-older opponent Gadelha comes into the fight on a shorter break, having just won her last fight against Angela Hill by split decision on May 16 at UFC Fight Night in Jacksonville, Florida.'Zhang didn't submit Jedrzejczyk, and I want to achieve that'Yan Xiaonan was the first female Chinese fighter to enter the Octagon. She signed a four-match contact with the UFC and had her first fight on November 25, 2017 at Fight Night Shanghai, eight months before current women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili.During the past four years, Yan has bagged five unanimous decision wins over Kailin Curran, Viviane Pereira, Syuri Kondo, Angela Hill, and Karolina Kowalkiewicz; Zhang also has five wins in this time, but with two submissions and one split decision. Yan's current record is significantly slimmer than that of Zhang, however. Yan is currently on 12-1 with one no contest, while Zhang is 21-1 and undefeated in her last 20. Both of them have a knock out (KO) rate of around 45 percent, but Yan's style has been more focused on striking in recent years.If Yan wins this fight, she would be a championship contender and could take part in the first UFC "China Derby" with Zhang.When asked about whom she'd like to fight the most, Yan said it's Joanna Jedrzejczyk: "Zhang Weili didn't submit her, and I want to achieve that."The fight between Zhang and Joanna is already considered the best female fight in MMA history by many. Zhang won a split decision after five fierce rounds against Joanna and, ever since that incredible victory, Zhang has become a superstar in China. Zhang and Yan both have sanda backgrounds, but when asked about their difference, Yan showed a smile and said, "Zhang's figure is more like Gadelha, and I'm taller.""For Zhang's next fight, which is probably to be made with Rose Namajunas, I think Zhang will win as Rose is not as strong as Jedrzejczyk. And if I win my fight with Gadelha, I think the China Derby will happen soon," Yan said when asked about what she expects from her future.Zhang is already an active champion, but she can't rest on her laurels with another Chinese contender rising through the ranks. Yan said, "I'm well prepared any time, but only if Dana White gives me an opportunity."'Gadelha is a BJJ black belt, I'm striking level 10'Yan Xiaonan passed a 14-day quarantine after coming back from Auckland and has trained consistently since. About the fight against Gadelha, she feels very confident, "I met her twice when I was training in Las Vegas, and I've also watched many videos of her fights. I know her very well." "My Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) coach is from Brazil, and he'd always like me to fight against her, so, we're preparing everything well, especially the strategy that my BJJ coach set for me," Yan added.Yan's coach Ruy Menezes is one of the first generation of BJJ practitioners in China. He got a black belt from the Gracie Family in 2002 and came to China for the first time in the following year. Ruy began to teach Jiu-Jitsu in Beijing in 2009, and he trained China's first UFC fighter Zhang Tiequan, as well as Li Jiangliang, Yan Xiaonan, and many other mixed martial artists.But due to the pandemic of COVID-19, he has been staying in Brazil and may not go to the UFC 253 to be the cornerman for Yan."Recently, my conditioning coach has trained me a lot on my explosive power and one-punch KO ability, but my head coach told me the most important thing is to win the whole match," Yan said."Gadelha is BJJ black belt, much higher than me, and she will definitely try to drag me to the canvas since the very beginning, but people said my standing skills are 'level 10'," the former professional sanda athlete said with a laugh."Gadelha has very good stamina and defence, she'd never been submitted, even after facing Jedrzejczyk twice. For this fight, I'll still focus on the entirety of match, as well try to find a KO opportunity, I believe I can do it."'Usually I'm quiet, but "Fury" in the Octagon'Yan said she's very excited about having the chance to fight a top-10 fighter but also worried about her team's safety due to traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The host venue for the fight has not been decided yet but probably in the Fight Island, but her team was asked to go to the United States next week, then go to Abu Dhabi from there by UFC private flight. They won't quarantine in the U.S."The condition out of China is worse than here, but professional sports are like this, athletes cannot take long rests, and my life has to go ahead," Yan said in a matter-of-fact way.Compared with Zhang, Yan is much less outgoing. She speaks simply, but that doesn't mean she isn't confident: "Every athlete trains to become the champion, if I don't want to be the champion, I wouldn't be an athlete."At the end of the interview, Yan was asked which of her nicknames she likes the most, and she said it's "Fury" and explained, "Usually, I'm quiet and do not like speak, but when I get into training and stand in the Octagon, I'm crazy, like being injected with chicken blood (Chinese proverb about getting invigorated).

I just love the stage!"After a shutdown of exactly five months due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) restarted on the afternoon of June 20. But, like most of the other recently rebooted professional sports leagues in the world, there was no audience at the venue â even the cheerleaders could only perform via an LED screen beside the court.Around two million messages were left by the audience on the Tencent Sports app during their livestream of the game between the Nanjing Monkey Kings and Zhejiang Lions showing people were excited for the return of basketball, but the two on-site commentators still had to ask each other "do you feel excited?" and try to create a positive vibe in the otherwise silent arena.On one hand, playing games behind closed doors is disappointing for fans who wanted to see the game live in the area, but on the other, the situation has led to the CBA regularly broadcasting their games in virtual reality (VR) â like what the NBA has been doing since 2014 â giving the home audience an immersive experience.By cooperating with China Mobile's Migu Video, the CBA lets the audience watch game live in VR, either on their smartphones or with a special headset, from different angles provided by 16 camera stands. The technology also allows fans to show their broadcast themselves in real-time on courtside screens.At the moment, it is easy for a league to broadcast live games in VR, but the penetration of VR devices in the target audiences is still low around the world due to reasons such as the high expense and often inconvenient user experience.Nevertheless, if holding live events behind closed doors becomes a common practice in the post-pandemic age â a period which may last for a relatively long time â will the large-scale application of 5G technology and the live streaming industry's boom on digital platforms combine to make virtual viewing a major component of modern sports?Traditional sports becoming eSportsDuring the pandemic, the world's major professional sports leagues had to pause, and so sports TV channels could only broadcast old games and events. Because of this, livestreams of eSport equivalents became a realistic alternative for fans.Because sports evolved from games, many video games can simulate real sports to a high degree, and some of them also have eSports leagues, like EA Sports' FIFA series, which is a yearly must-buy for a lot of gamers.In fact, some of the more expensive sports, have already been using simulators for a long while. Formula One (F1) is a major example of this, and as racing â in terms of both simulation and arcade styles â is a major genre of video games, F1 games are easily accepted by diehard fans and a wider audience too.F1 Virtual Grand Prix launched an official global league in 2017 and, during the pandemic, many F1 racers joined to stay busy but also keep their skills sharp. And by competing online, many developed closer bonds with their fans.According to an article released by the Ministry of Sports on June 22, F1 Virtual Grand Prix eSports series eclipsed 30 million views on TV and digital platforms combined during the COVID-19 lockdown.The number evidently cannot compete with the trillions of cumulative viewers for the real F1 Grand Prix series in 2019, but it's still a significant result for eSports.Basketball game NBA 2K got a peak number of around 14,000 simultaneous viewers in a live competition which was held with real NBA stars on March 31. FIBA used this as the basis for setting up the international FIBA eSports Open 2020 which was held for the first time ever from June 19 to 21.While it is true that it is becoming more popular for professional leagues to move their offline contests online, when sports lose their physicality, to a large extent, they also lose their essence.Smart sports equipmentMost sports events and exercises must be played with specific equipment, and currently, more and more fitness equipment, whether found in professional gyms or at home, can be combined with video games, like some treadmill and spinning bikes that connect with screens and turn users' workout data into virtual scenes.To get in on the trend, some video game developers are also creating motion sensing peripherals to push their players into getting physical.To give a recent example, Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventure on the Switch platform has become a smash hit during the pandemic, as people can use its ring-shaped peripheral to play a game and keep fit at the same time.Combining exercise with video games dates back to expensive American gyms in the 1980s. But now, motion sensing apps for yoga, dancing, running, cycling and other solo exercises are very common worldwide.However, on an industry-wide level, as sports are all about being "Faster, Higher, Stronger" and differ from exercise by being based in competition and confrontation, to create authentic experiences, sports game developers should consider creating products that allow people to do head-to-head or team sports in small, isolated spaces.Playing sports with X-realityIn the world of Steven Spielberg's 2018 movie "Ready Player One", people from all around the world can use custom avatars to play with and against each other in the same virtual world by using wearable technology.To a certain degree at present, that is already possible: people can walk on omni-direction treadmills or be suspended in midair on wires to expand their active range in a virtual world, and also some helmet or armor-like clothing can let you feel vibrations, heat and wind.This method of playing sports fits the post-pandemic age, but at the moment, it can only be realized in large, public areas such as the shopping malls, arcades and amusement parks due to the size and cost of the equipment.But, even if this were to become readily accessible on a consumer level, it still raises a question: Are gamers satisfied with just simulating traditional sports?A Japanese company has created an innovative team game called HADO with augmented reality (AR) technology. Through the headset's screen, players can see a game world and their human opponents at the same time, and by doing gestures while wearing the arm sensor, players can perform attacking and defensive moves with virtual fireballs and shields.During the pandemic, HADO launched a new project called HADO Xball, which is like a reality show happening behind closed doors. Inspired by Asian hip-hop culture, the players move around like dancers or stuntmen on the set of a martial arts movie and the audience, watching the livestreams from anywhere, can give energy to their favorite players by shaking their phone, increases the interactivity between users and making the impact of "the twelfth man" more direct than ever possible in real world sports.The potential of X-reality is huge, and the market is burgeoning too as the technology is already used in some areas to improve productivity, and many electronic equipment manufacturers such as Apple intend to put AR glasses on sale in the next few years.Chinese mobile company Huawei also launched a cross platform real time Kung Fu game experience powered by Huawei 5G. In the advertisement video, a Kung Fu master equipped with all kinds of sensors remotely fights head-to-head with an eSports gamer.As the slogan of Huawei 5G Kung Fu Showdown is "The pain feels real in 5G," perhaps one day soon, people can get the feeling of playing real sports in the virtual world.(Cover photo designed by Li Chenqi)Zheng Guohua is a 17-year-old middle-distance runner from Tumed Left Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. For the past four years, she has been coached by her father Zheng Long.Father and daughter get up at 4 a.m. every day to train on the road. Dad rides a motorbike and wears flashlights to light up his daughter's predawn route.Because he wants her to maintain her physical condition during the bitter winter months, Long came up with the ingenious idea of building a "home gym" â from discarded items such as used tires and wire.She is very thankful for what her father has done for her.When she's tired of training, she seeks inspiration from his motto, "You can get superman rewards only by making superman efforts."Guohua has won a lot of races and has a best time of 2:28 in the 800 meters â an improvement of 33 seconds over the last three years.Father and daughter have also raised over 6,000 yuan by selling bricks that they picked up on the street. The family, which has a monthly income of just 4,000 yuan, sent all of it to a local charity during the COVID-19 pandemic.(Video Editor: Li Chenqi)Wasps will play in the Gallagher Premiership final against newly-crowned European champions Exeter Chiefs, Premiership Rugby announced on Wednesday.The announcement came after the club received no additional positive cases in the latest round of Covid-19 testing."Everyone at Premiership Rugby is delighted to confirm Wasps' place in the Final after the latest round of tests as part of our PCR COVID-19 screening programme," a statement from Premiership Rugby read in part.Wasps' participation was in serious doubt after the club confirmed four more positive tests on Monday, in addition to the seven reported last Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 11.This means that Challenge Cup winners Bristol Bears, who were comprehensively defeated by Wasps in the semi-final nearly two weeks ago, will not have to replace them in the game.Wasps group chief executive Stephen Vaughan thanked Rugby Football Union (RFU), Premiership Rugby and Public Health England officials for their "clarity and assistance" throughout the entire process."As a club, we are delighted that we can now take our rightful place in this Saturday's Premiership Rugby final. To all of our fans and well-wishers, thank you for your many messages of support, this final is for you."The Premiership final, which will be a rematch of the 2017 final won by Exeter, is set to take place on Saturday, October 24, at Twickenham.(With input from agencies)Wasps will play in the Gallagher Premiership final against newly-crowned European champions Exeter Chiefs, Premiership Rugby announced on Wednesday.The announcement came after the club received no additional positive cases in the latest round of Covid-19 testing."Everyone at Premiership Rugby is delighted to confirm Wasps' place in the Final after the latest round of tests as part of our PCR COVID-19 screening programme," a statement from Premiership Rugby read in part.Wasps' participation was in serious doubt after the club confirmed four more positive tests on Monday, in addition to the seven reported last Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 11.This means that Challenge Cup winners Bristol Bears, who were comprehensively defeated by Wasps in the semi-final nearly two weeks ago, will not have to replace them in the game.Wasps group chief executive Stephen Vaughan thanked Rugby Football Union (RFU), Premiership Rugby and Public Health England officials for their "clarity and assistance" throughout the entire process."As a club, we are delighted that we can now take our rightful place in this Saturday's Premiership Rugby final.

The game against Paris Saint-Germain wasn't smooth sailing yet even a loss wouldn't have tainted their reputation as clearly being the best club team in Europe as they had steamrolled everyone on their way to the final, including the now infamous 8-2 mauling of FC Barcelona.When Hans-Dieter "Hansi" Flick was appointed as Bayern manager on November 3, 2019, a "new manager bounce" was expected. After all, the side had been floundering under Niko Kovac, so the only way could be up; what nobody really expected was for Bayern to bounce up into the stratosphere.Since Flick arrived last year, the team have won 39 games, lost only three times and drawn exactly once, and the Champions League victory joined a romp through the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal (German league cup) to bring the team a historic treble.Flick's aggressive style of play and the overall team consistency made Bayern look like they would rule the roost for years to come, and normally they would, but this is 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned football on its head and, for Bayern, that has played out in a heavily foreshortened season.There was less than a month between their Champions League win last season and the start of this new one and Bayern Munich's fatigue has showed, most notably in a shock 4-1 loss to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim on September 27. Not only that but last week, the team had two games in 48 hours: a DFB-Pokal game on October 15 and then a Bundesliga game on October 17.This would be fine if Flick had a squad he could rotate through but this summer's transfer window has sapped the Bayern bench. The main loss is midfield maestro Thiago who has moved to Liverpool. Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho returning to their home clubs doesn't help in that area either, especially when the big signings â Leroy Sane, Douglas Costa, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting â are all attackers. Plus, Serge Gnabry, the team's second highest scorer behind Robert Lewandowski last year, has been ruled out of the game due to testing positive for COVID-19.This puts Bayern at a severe disadvantage in tonight's game against Atletico Madrid; not because of the type of weakness but simply because it is a weakness. If there's one manager in all of football who loves to exploit the flaws of opponents, it's the cruel and callous Diego Simeone.Atletico's previous Champions League campaign shows how tactically villainous he can be. Against defending champions Liverpool, once his team took the early lead in the first leg, Atletico played to maintain it by any means necessary. Ten men behind the ball, cynical fouls, possession for the sake of possession; his Atletico will do anything to grind out a result. And now, with the arrival of ex-Barcelona man Luis Suarez, Simeone has a player as notoriously black hearted as himself.After that sensational defeat of Liverpool, Atletico went on to lose to RB Leipzig in the knockout quarterfinals, demonstrating that their tactics are an all-or-nothing gamble. Against a massive side like Bayern Munich, it's a risk, but it could also be their key to victory.When Bayern Munich won last season's Champions League in August, it was something of an inevitability. The game against Paris Saint-Germain wasn't smooth sailing yet even a loss wouldn't have tainted their reputation as clearly being the best club team in Europe as they had steamrolled everyone on their way to the final, including the now infamous 8-2 mauling of FC Barcelona.When Hans-Dieter "Hansi" Flick was appointed as Bayern manager on November 3, 2019, a "new manager bounce" was expected. After all, the side had been floundering under Niko Kovac, so the only way could be up; what nobody really expected was for Bayern to bounce up into the stratosphere.Since Flick arrived last year, the team have won 39 games, lost only three times and drawn exactly once, and the Champions League victory joined a romp through the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal (German league cup) to bring the team a historic treble.Flick's aggressive style of play and the overall team consistency made Bayern look like they would rule the roost for years to come, and normally they would, but this is 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned football on its head and, for Bayern, that has played out in a heavily foreshortened season.There was less than a month between their Champions League win last season and the start of this new one and Bayern Munich's fatigue has showed, most notably in a shock 4-1 loss to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim on September 27. Not only that but last week, the team had two games in 48 hours: a DFB-Pokal game on October 15 and then a Bundesliga game on October 17.This would be fine if Flick had a squad he could rotate through but this summer's transfer window has sapped the Bayern bench. The main loss is midfield maestro Thiago who has moved to Liverpool. Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho returning to their home clubs doesn't help in that area either, especially when the big signings â Leroy Sane, Douglas Costa, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting â are all attackers. Plus, Serge Gnabry, the team's second highest scorer behind Robert Lewandowski last year, has been ruled out of the game due to testing positive for COVID-19.This puts Bayern at a severe disadvantage in tonight's game against Atletico Madrid; not because of the type of weakness but simply because it is a weakness. If there's one manager in all of football who loves to exploit the flaws of opponents, it's the cruel and callous Diego Simeone.Atletico's previous Champions League campaign shows how tactically villainous he can be. Against defending champions Liverpool, once his team took the early lead in the first leg, Atletico played to maintain it by any means necessary. Ten men behind the ball, cynical fouls, possession for the sake of possession; his Atletico will do anything to grind out a result. And now, with the arrival of ex-Barcelona man Luis Suarez, Simeone has a player as notoriously black hearted as himself.After that sensational defeat of Liverpool, Atletico went on to lose to RB Leipzig in the knockout quarterfinals, demonstrating that their tactics are an all-or-nothing gamble. Against a massive side like Bayern Munich, it's a risk, but it could also be their key to victory.Context is important. In the build up, Manchester United vs. Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) was considered a big game. The zillionaire champions of France vs. the resurgent English bronze medalists. The realpolitik on the night was very different: an empty stadium under a downpour on a chilly Parisian October night set the tone from the very beginning.Limp and lifeless, for the duration â but especially the early goings â this blockbuster fixture could have been passed off as a pre-season friendly. PSG manager Thomas Tuchel had an excuse as most of his star players were out with injuries. What can't be excused was how he seemingly did nothing to mitigate that on the field.PSG's formation is akin to an accordion. Playing in a 4-3-3 formation, that back four tend to stay rigid in front of their goalkeeper, becoming a back seven when necessary. Those three midfielders who dropped back then usually spring forward and push up the pitch to slightly beyond the halfway line where the front three of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel di Maria wait deep. They like to play with space; di Maria to fire in crosses, Neymar and Mbappe to use their incredible pace.This works when you have a full squad firing on both flanks. Without midfielders Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes out due to injury and Marquinhos, technically a center-back but a genuine box-to-box maverick, unavailable also, PSG had practically no service going forwards.To make matters worse, Manchester United looked like they had forgone the concept of formations altogether. Their 3-4-1-2 does leave plenty of space around Bruno Fernandes â the "1" â but their focus on overloading man-to-man defense created scenarios where Fernandes, Scott McTominay, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof and Axel Tuanzebe would smother Neymar and, in the process, leave roughly a third of the pitch for PSG to play in.This bizarre combination, played out a low-effort slow motion, eliminated almost all attacking link-up play so it's not a surprise that the first two goals came from dead ball scenarios and individual errors. In the 20th minute, Anthony Martial was fouled in the box by Abdou Diallo giving United a penalty. Fernandes took it with a hop, skip and a kick into the bottom right corner â only to have it saved by goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Navas, however, was off his line so it was taken again. Fernandes took it with a hop, skip and a kick into the bottom right corner and made it 1-0.Ten minutes into the second half, PSG got a corner and Neymar fired it into the United box. Martial, the closest to Neymar and completely unhurried by opponents, leapt up, closed his eyes and headed it into his own goal while badly trying to defend.At 1-1 and with half an hour left, the game began to look like a real match. Idrissa Gueye and Ander Herrera getting swapped out for Moise Kean and Rafinha lit a spark in PSG and they started to pose a genuine threat going forward; Manchester United's substitution of Alex Telles for Paul Pogba ended up being a game changer.As play opened up in the final stretch, Marcus Rashford found himself with acres of space around the PSG box and had several attempts on goal. The one trend that remained is that these were either individual efforts or clumsy attempts at link-up play. In both cases he was repeatedly snuffed out by Diallo and Presnel Kimpembe.As the clock ticked down and this agonizing display looked to be headed to a 1-1 draw, Pogba, who had been active from the moment he came on, played a short cross to Rashford who turned, ran into the gap between Danilo Pereira and Pablo Sarabia and smashed it diagonally into the bottom left corner.With only three minutes to go, Rashford won the game for United in Paris, just as he did one year ago with the extra time penalty that knocked PSG out of the 2018/19 tournament. Not an exciting or entertaining victory, but an important one for United nonetheless. With current Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig in the same group, Rashford's goal could be crucial in getting his side through to the knockouts.Context is important.

I will only take part in a tournament when I am 100% fit. "At the moment, it looks like I can make my comeback at the Australian Open in January."While he has made significant progress in his recovery, he said he is still not at the point where he can train as usual. "Not yet, more than two hours with the racket are not possible at the moment," said Federer, who is currently ranked fourth in the world and saw Rafa Nadal equal his Grand Slam haul with a 13th French Open title this month. "But I've been working on my stamina and strength absolutely without pain for a while. There will be no further operations."Federer is often asked about his retirement plans, but the Swiss said he would keep playing as long as he was enjoying it. "I have been thinking about ideas for about five years," he said.

It isn't just the date that's strange to see, so is the line-up for tonight's match day 1, which includes teams such as Istanbul Basaksehir from the Turkish Superlig, Rennes from France's Ligue 1 and Ferencvaros from Hungary's Nemezti Bajnoksag I (never heard of it either), all of whom are making their Champions League debut or return after decades away.The most reassuring sight is Manchester United of the English Premier League taking on perennial Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Both veterans of the Champions League, the sides have only ever faced each other once before in the tournament: in the 2018/19 season, PSG won the first leg 2-0 then lost the second to United 3-1.Manchester United's qualification for this Champions League campaign was practically decided in the final game of the season. Having spent the 2019 portion of the Premier League balancing wins, losses and draws, the Red Devils went unbeaten from February 1 onwards, eking their way up the table to third place. They also put together a commendable run in the Europa League, where they got knocked out in the semifinal by eventual winners Sevilla.PSG on the other hand have become a perennial competitor in the Champions League ever since they got taken over by the Qatar Sports Investment group. They reached the final of the foreshortened 2019/20 season but were beaten by Bayern Munich.Typically, the finalists should be the favorites when going up against a team that came up from the Europa League, however the manner in which PSG so recently lost could make Manchester United think their opponents are there for the taking. Les Parisiens spent most of the second half acting bratty, playing for fouls and, when they did concede, very clearly mentally crumbled.Not only are they unlikely to have built mental fortitude in barely eight weeks, manager Thomas Tuchel has said he has just 11 healthy players. While he will be pleased that his strike team of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar are fighting fit, confirmed out of this game are regular starters Juan Bernat, Mauro Icardi, Thilo Kehrer, Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes and Julian Draxler, Marquinhos and Danilo Pereira are expected to start on the bench.Another player missing from the PSG squad is Edinson Cavani, who transferred to Manchester United in the summer transfer window. While he has recently been dealing with his COVID-19 quarantine and not part of the squad in France, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also missing captain Harry Maguire, Marcus Rojo and Phil Jones from his standard line up.This would suggest United go into this as the favorites, but their record in the 2020/21 Premier League season has been appalling. A 3-1 loss to Crystal Palace and a spectacular 6-1 capitulation to Tottenham Hotspur sandwich a 3-2 win over Brighton, a game that officially ended 2-2. The referee then decided to restart it because of a VAR decision and award Manchester a penalty officially listed as taking place 10 minutes into added time. Only their 4-1 win over Newcastle last week counts as anything genuinely positive.PSG, whose season started with four games in 10 days, began with two shock losses to Lens and Marseille but have since righted the ship and won the following five by an aggregate of 16-1. The momentum is on their side and if they can put together a team of second stringers to go alongside their world class forwards, they should be able to handle Manchester United, but if United truly give it their best, they could force PSG to break.(Cover image: PSG's Kylian Mbappe and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford during their Champions League game at the Parc des Princes, Paris, France, March 7, 2019. /Getty)Not even two whole months since last season's final in Lisbon, the UEFA Champions League is back.

The momentum is on their side and if they can put together a team of second stringers to go alongside their world class forwards, they should be able to handle Manchester United, but if United truly give it their best, they could force PSG to break.(Cover image: PSG's Kylian Mbappe and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford during their Champions League game at the Parc des Princes, Paris, France, March 7, 2019. /Getty)Champions League and Europa League prize money will be reduced over the next five seasons, as Europe's football governing body UEFA grapples with the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to reports. The Times of London reported that UEFA had informed its member associations that it lost 514 million British pounds ($664 million) following the reduction in both television and sponsorship income after delays in the knockout stages last season, the report said. The two competitions were suspended in March when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the global sporting calendar and resumed only in August after the top leagues in Europe wrapped up their respective seasons. The knockout phase was staged behind closed doors at neutral locations and each round's tie was also reduced to a single fixture instead of the usual home-away format. Last season's forecast had 1.95 billion euros ($2.3 billion) set aside for the 32 teams in the Champions League group stage. The report added that English clubs can expect to see TV and prize money drop by about 4 percent. The ongoing pandemic has made tremendous and profound impact on European football, as a number of listed giants hit hard in the stock market recently.Cristiano Ronaldo's positive COVID-19 result last week prompted Juventus' stock price to dip to a six-month low, while the shares of Manchester United, which boasts most Chinese fans in the world, has dropped by 27 percent from the yearly high back in February, alongside the team's poor performances on the pitch.(With input from Reuters)Champions League and Europa League prize money will be reduced over the next five seasons, as Europe's football governing body UEFA grapples with the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to reports. The Times of London reported that UEFA had informed its member associations that it lost 514 million British pounds ($664 million) following the reduction in both television and sponsorship income after delays in the knockout stages last season, the report said. The two competitions were suspended in March when the pandemic wreaked havoc on the global sporting calendar and resumed only in August after the top leagues in Europe wrapped up their respective seasons. The knockout phase was staged behind closed doors at neutral locations and each round's tie was also reduced to a single fixture instead of the usual home-away format. Last season's forecast had 1.95 billion euros ($2.3 billion) set aside for the 32 teams in the Champions League group stage. The report added that English clubs can expect to see TV and prize money drop by about 4 percent. The ongoing pandemic has made tremendous and profound impact on European football, as a number of listed giants hit hard in the stock market recently.Cristiano Ronaldo's positive COVID-19 result last week prompted Juventus' stock price to dip to a six-month low, while the shares of Manchester United, which boasts most Chinese fans in the world, has dropped by 27 percent from the yearly high back in February, alongside the team's poor performances on the pitch.(With input from Reuters)Former Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney said on Monday that he had tested negative for the coronavirus but must self-isolate for 10 days after coming into contact with a friend who tested positive. "Just received the news that my COVID-19 test has shown I do not have the virus," Rooney wrote on Twitter.

Retrospective punishment can only be considered if an incident was not seen at the time. The verdict has raised further controversy about the decision on the day made by referee Michael Oliver and video assistant referee (VAR) David Coote."Pickford on Van Dijk is a clear challenge that endangers a player with excessive force and should have been deemed a sending-off. A red card should have been issued," former Premier League referee Mark Halsey told BBC. "Why it got missed only the PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Board) can tell us that. It's amazing the statement has come out that they didn't recognize it as a red card, serious foul play challenge. I'm astonished," he added. The stance was supported by another former referee, Mark Clattenburg. "Michael Oliver should have been told to look at his monitor by VAR David Coote. Had Oliver done so, I'm sure he would have sent off Jordan Pickford for his challenge on Virgil van Dijk," he told Daily Mail."I've also heard it claimed Pickford could not be dismissed because Van Dijk was offside â rubbish. Oliver had not blown his whistle by the time Pickford lunged in, so he could still have been punished," he observed. "VAR confirming later Van Dijk was offside does not nullify a red. The bottom line is, Coote should have sent Oliver to his monitor. Given Van Dijk was injured, the referee had plenty of time to review the incident." Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was equally incensed, but his major concern right now is how to deal with Van Dijk's absence."A few things are clear, so he now will be out for a while, that's clear," said Klopp in a press briefing. "We don't want to set any timeframe, to be honest, because each player is different and each individual is different.""So we feel now in this moment extremely, extremely for him because most of us have been in a similar situation and we know that these situations are absolutely rubbish. You don't need it but you have to get over it and Virgil will get over it, 100%, and today is already the first day, if you want, of the recovery," he added. Former defender Jamie Carragher noted that Klopp's side must look to sign a replacement in the January transfer window. "The big question you're looking at now is, can Liverpool win the league without Van Dijk there? I think it blows the title race wide open," the veteran told Sky Sports. "Liverpool have to go into the market in January and not just because of Van Dijk's injury. They were weak in that area anyway.

I also want to thank the Blue team for giving us such a great show. This fantastic event showed great potential for Chinese golf."The 18-year-old Yin Ruoning, who had just turned professional last year and made history by winning three successive tournaments at the start of her professional career, was a member at the Feng's team. She made an eagle at the 13th hole to win her team the second point during the singles match Saturday as the first full point of the week for the Shanghai teenager. "Maybe I'm best suitable for singles. I lacked for a little bit of chemistry yesterday," said Yin. "Shanshan told me to forget that and to focus on today. I played great on the whole and was happy to win a point."The Blue team was captained by one of the country's golf trailblazer Liang Wenchong, and made up six male pros and seven female amateurs who are also elite students from top universities to reach a good balance. The coronavirus pandemic left the sports world idle in the first half of this year. With many professional golf tournaments still on hold, the organizers recognized the opportunity to build a platform that allows the country's rising young stars to test their mettle against some top talents."We always want to organize quality tournaments for the next generation of Chinese golfers, but the question has been how best to do this," said Li Hong, managing director of the China LPGA, co-host of the event. "This year we invited many amateurs who are student-athletes of prestigious universities. The idea was to connect the amateurs to the professional players.""It's unprecedented. Feng Shanshan is staying in China due to the pandemic, and Liang Wenchong was very glad to come too. It's a special opportunity because of the pandemic."Liang Wenchong, three-time winner on the Asian Tour, spoke highly of the event for its effort to connect the amateurs to the professional players and revealed that by talking with the young amateur players, he can feel the difference between them and his generation of Chinese golfers."I was excited when I heard about the Sina Cup. It's special and Feng Shanshan is also here. It's not easy to host such an event now. Many of our male golfers did not even have an event to join this year, and this is a great chance to warm up."Liang echoed Feng's idea for young golf players to balance the sport and the academic life in the early stage instead of placing too much pressure on becoming a professional golfer."The amateurs are all outstanding people, not only as golfers but also as talented students in prestigious universities," said the 42-year-old Liang, who made his best result at the 2010 PGA Championship with a tied-eighth finish."They balance sports and the academic life and are great examples to parents who are thinking about encouraging their kids to play golf."(Cover image: Feng Shanshan lifts the trophy while celebrating with her team's players after winning the inaugural Sina Cup golf tournament in Beijing, China, October 17, 2020. /SINA)China's 10-time LPGA Tour winner Feng Shanshan led a special squad at the Beijing Shadow Creek Golf Club last week to claim the inaugural Sina Cup as she praised the event for showing great potential of Chinese golf talents.Backed by Sina.com, a media titan in China, the inaugural Sina Cup was first of its kind in the country to feature professional golfers and amateurs, male and female in the two-day Ryder Cup-style tournament.  Feng's team was comprised of six female pros, all from the China LPGA Tour and seven male amateurs, many of whom are elite students from prestigious overseas universities.After going into the singles matches on Saturday with an 8-4 lead from the foursome and fourballs sessions on Friday, Feng's team proved too strong for the other side to seal the victory 17-7."I'm really proud of my players who played incredible from day one," said Feng, the current world No. 26 who had her maiden experience as a captain at the event. "As a captain, I did nothing important except for the logistics. I also want to thank the Blue team for giving us such a great show. This fantastic event showed great potential for Chinese golf."The 18-year-old Yin Ruoning, who had just turned professional last year and made history by winning three successive tournaments at the start of her professional career, was a member at the Feng's team. She made an eagle at the 13th hole to win her team the second point during the singles match Saturday as the first full point of the week for the Shanghai teenager. "Maybe I'm best suitable for singles. I lacked for a little bit of chemistry yesterday," said Yin. "Shanshan told me to forget that and to focus on today. I played great on the whole and was happy to win a point."The Blue team was captained by one of the country's golf trailblazer Liang Wenchong, and made up six male pros and seven female amateurs who are also elite students from top universities to reach a good balance. The coronavirus pandemic left the sports world idle in the first half of this year. With many professional golf tournaments still on hold, the organizers recognized the opportunity to build a platform that allows the country's rising young stars to test their mettle against some top talents."We always want to organize quality tournaments for the next generation of Chinese golfers, but the question has been how best to do this," said Li Hong, managing director of the China LPGA, co-host of the event. "This year we invited many amateurs who are student-athletes of prestigious universities. The idea was to connect the amateurs to the professional players.""It's unprecedented. Feng Shanshan is staying in China due to the pandemic, and Liang Wenchong was very glad to come too. It's a special opportunity because of the pandemic."Liang Wenchong, three-time winner on the Asian Tour, spoke highly of the event for its effort to connect the amateurs to the professional players and revealed that by talking with the young amateur players, he can feel the difference between them and his generation of Chinese golfers."I was excited when I heard about the Sina Cup.

No time frame has been put on his absence by the club but an injury of this nature could force him on the sidelines for several months and even miss the remainder of the campaign.In an Instagram post on Sunday night, the defender said: "I'm now fully focused on my recovery and will do everything I can to be back as quickly as possible. In football, as in life, I believe everything happens for a reason and it's important to try and keep level headed whether going through the highs and lows."According to Sky Sports, Pickford, who escaped a red card from the referee, attempted to make contact with Van Dijk but has yet to speak to him directly.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is yet to speak publicly about the huge blow of losing one of his most reliable players but he questioned why no action was taken against Pickford during his post-game press conference on Saturday."For me it was a clear penalty that I saw. Then obviously we saw the flag went up, so offside. I still thought it was worth a look on the foul but that didn't happen," said Klopp. "We have no power there, we just sit here and you discuss it with me. You have to ask other people about that, not me. What can I say?"Statistics from the BBC show that Van Dijk has missed just one Premier League game since joining Liverpool. He played all 38 Premier League games in 2018/19 as Liverpool conceded just 22 goals. In his 95 Premier League starts for Liverpool, they have conceded just 78 goals and kept 44 clean sheets.In 2019, he was awarded the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA)'s Player of the Year and also became the first defender to pick up UEFA's Player of the Year award.Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most severe injuries suffered by players and it requires a recovery period of six to nine months.

"But I am happy that this is the way I finished the tournament and it is a really special tournament for me.""I know I have a really good chance to qualify, but still it is not 100 percent yet," Rublev continued to say. "This year, I didn't expect that I would have a chance, so in the end nothing is going to change for me... Even if I don't make it, the season was really good for me anyway. If I make it, it is really good news."(With input from agencies)Ezzeldin Bahader, an Egyptian grandfather, was recently recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest professional player. He will celebrate his 75th birthday on November 3.Israeli Isaak Hayik, 73, previously held the record.The recognition came following a game he played on October 6, where he missed a penalty kick and his team lost 2-3 to El Ayat Sports club in the Egyptian third division league.Bahader made his debut in March, in which he scored a goal from the penalty spot, and was planning on to claim the title that same month. When the pandemic started and halted global sports, he had to wait until recently to achieve his dream. Bahader previously told media he was 75, which he attributed to "rounding up." According to him, sponsors and publicity were attracted to his team, thanks to his fame.The previous amateur player had his grandchildren attending Saturday's match, chanting "Come on, grandpa" from the touchline."I dream of being able to break my own record one more time, just to make the competition a little harder," Bahader said, though he is now out of the contract.(With input from agencies)Ezzeldin Bahader, an Egyptian grandfather, was recently recognized by Guinness World Records as the world's oldest professional player.

Mohamed Magdi Afsha opening goal inside five minutes and a second-half penalty from Ali Maaloul gave the eight-time winners the win.However, the result might have been different had the hosts converted their chances, including a penalty just before halftime. Al Ahly goalkeeper Mohamed El-Shenawy had fouled Ivorian forward Gbagbo Laurent in the penalty area but he subsequently denied Badie Aouk from the spot.Victory saw Al Ahly coach Pitso Mosimane get his first win against the Moroccan club in his sixth attempt. The previous five games saw the club he managed, Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa, lose four times and draw just once.After the game, Mosimane paid tribute to the players, particularly El-Shenawy for his penalty save, but was cautious about early conclusions that the team was already in its 13th final."I'm happy with the result, but I would have been much happier had we scored more goals. We have won nothing yet and must now focus on the return leg till we achieve our target and reach the final."Wydad coach Miguel Gamondi said he was disappointed in the result as it was a home defeat but added that they will do what they can to overturn the deficit."The early goal complicated the game and missing the penalty was even more heartbreaking. We felt exhausted after playing a huge number of games in the domestic league."The second leg will take place next Friday at the Cairo International Stadum in Cairo.The second semi-final, another Morocco v Egypt tie, will take place later on Sunday between Moroccan champions Raja Casablanca and Zamalek.(With input from agencies)Egyptian side Al Ahly boosted their chances of advancing to the CAF Champions League final after securing a win away against Wydad Athletic Club in their semi-final first leg.Al Ahly won 2-0 at the Complexe Mohamed V in Casablanca on Saturday.

Though he did not score the goal himself, Bassogog gave himself an excellent present for his 25th birthday.This game was not as peaceful as its scoreboard. In the 9th minute, Zall's Liu Yi and Jianye's Fernando Karanga bumped into each other when they competed for a header. Both shed blood. Liu changed a new jersey and had to wear head protection. In the second half, Zall's Song Zhiwei kicked the ball to one of Jianye's players when the game was stalled, almost causing strife. As a result, Song was given a yellow card.Later, Song also committed a foul on Dourado by kicking him down on the ground, but he got away with it. Zall's Eddy Gnahore broke into Jianye's box into Jianye's box and was taken down there in the 64th minute, but no foul was called.The two teams will meet again on October 23.'Shanghai Derby' ends 0-0The CSL defending champions Shanghai SIPG failed to win the "Shanghai Derby" against Shanghai Shenhua in the championship group.

He believes this separates the UFC from other combat sports leagues, and from the world of contemporary boxing in particular, by keeping competition high and preventing fighters from getting padded resumes.For fans, this is a good thing. For fighters, less so â especially fighters in the position of Brian "T-City" Ortega. Ortega had an undefeated streak of 14-0 with one No Contest that lasted from 2010 to 2018. His loss to then-UFC men's featherweight champion Max Holloway at UFC 231 on December 8, 2018, was due to a doctor's stoppage. It was an anticlimactic end to his hot streak, not so much because of the loss itself, but because it would be the last round Ortega would fight for almost two years.Ortega took almost a year to recuperate from his injuries. During that time, he got into a heated rivalry with Jung Chan-sung, better known to MMA fans as The Korean Zombie (TKZ). Even though it was revealed that it was orchestrated by TKZ's translator Jay Park, it drew a lot of attention, and a fight was signed for UFC Fight Night: Busan on December 21, 2019.An ACL tear forced Ortega to pull out on December 4. That should have been the end of the feud: The trash talk had been revealed to be a put-on, and Ortega was out of action. However, several days later, in an ESPN interview, TKZ said he thought Ortega was ducking him.Certain people in MMA don't take kindly to that sort of banter. Conor McGregor found out the hard way with Khabib Nurmagomedov in the cage, Leon Edwards found out with Jorge Masvidal backstage at UFC Fight Night London, and Jay Park found out when Ortega walked up to him in the crowd and slapped him at UFC 248 on March 7 this year. The hype was now real, and there could only be one fight for Ortega's return.That fight took place at UFC Fight Island 6 on October 18, 2020. After almost two years on the shelf, and with a point to prove, all eyes were on Ortega. The two men are known as brawlers, so it was expected that Ortega would start fast. Instead, Round 1 was almost entirely a feeling out process with Ortega using his jab to set up harder strikes that found their target later into the round.The chess match ended a minute into Round 2 when TKZ sprinted over and tried punch combinations on Ortega's chin. Ortega said he wanted to be "unrecognizable" in this fight, and he showed it. Instead of being drawn into a slugfest, he maintained his composure and built on the jab and jab feints of Round 1 with takedown attempts and feints. TKZ, usually a bulldozer, now looked timid, unsure when to pull the trigger to avoid caught in Ortega's excellent jiujitsu. With barely 60 seconds remaining, he reverted to type and tried another bullrush, only to find himself on the receiving end of a pinpoint reverse elbow.TKZ survived the round, and the remainder of the fight proved "Zombie" isn't just a nickname. It was given to Chan because he's notoriously resilient, but following that second round elbow, he really became dead inside. Even when he had Ortega pinned against the cage, his head was still, and his feet were flat.From there, the only differences in rounds 3, 4 and 5 were how much damage Ortega inflicted on TKZ and how far ahead of him he pulled in terms of points. TKZ only wanted to apply pressure and swing for the fences. Meanwhile, Ortega mixed all his skills to run rings around TKZ and pulverize him. In Round 3, he chased TKZ across the Octagon, hunting for a takedown, only to release when he was expected to pull down and instead cut TKZ open with a punishing right hook.In the final round, TKZ was so confused by Ortega's offense that he found himself getting hit by simple right and left straights. When the final bell rang, it was no surprise that Ortega won by unanimous decision (50-45, 50-45, 50-45). What was surprising was how good Ortega was. It didn't matter that he didn't get a tune-up fight; he didn't need one. He hasn't been gone for 22 months, he's been preparing for 22 months, and now he's better than ever.One thing UFC president Dana White is particularly proud of is ensuring nobody in his organization gets a "tune-up" fight.

Sichuan rookie Zhu Songwei went 1-7 from the field to finish with five points in 20 minutes.After another newbie, Zheng Qilong of the Jiangsu Dragons, scored 20 points in Saturday's season opener, many expected Zhu to have a similar performance. Zhu, 23, averaged 19.6 points and 7.6 rebounds in the Chinese University Basketball Association and had been nicknamed the "Kevin Durant of Shantou University."However, the CBA is a different world. Hu missed six shots, over half of which were wide open. He also committed four fouls and when he was on the court, Sichuan was the losing side. One game could never define Zhu's career but it's a reminder he needs to work harder to adapt to the league.Shenzhen established a safe lead from the beginning with a 15-2 run. Sichuan managed to slim the deficit to single digits more than once but their defense lacked consistency. After the first quarter, Shenzhen finished every quarter leading by 10+ points before taking the win.Dai Huaibo leads Jilin over NanjingThe Jilin Northeast Tigers beat the Nanjing Monkey Kings 105-97 on Sunday. Though Jilin's Jiang Yuxing fouled out early in the fourth quarter, Dai Huaibo carried the team on his shoulders by dropping a game-high 27 points. Dai's constant attack on Nanjing's paint helped Jilin lead 29-10 in free throw attempts.Having missed the playoffs last season, Nanjing went through great changes during the offseason. They hired a new general manager, Huo Nan, appointed a new head coach, Zvjezdan Misimovic, and landed 13 new players.Nanjing saw five of their players reach double-digit points but the team also turned the ball over 21 times, giving Jilin too many opportunities for easy points via fast break. Meanwhile, the 31 fouls they committed also meant Nanjing's players need to get more familiar with each other defensively.Beijing pockets win for Bayi's absenceThe Bayi Rockets, who were scheduled to play the Beijing Ducks on Sunday, did not show up in the arena. Therefore, Beijing was awarded a 20-0 win. There's no official announcement whether Bayi will continue to miss the rest of their games this season.Wang Zhelin is outnumbered by ShanxiThe Shanxi Loongs defeated the Fujian Sturgeons 99-92. Though Fujian's ace center Wang Zhelin put down 32 points and 18 rebounds, both game highs, he could not carry his team to victory alone.Despite Wang's incredible performance, Fujian only saw three of their players reach double-digit points â Huang Yichao (13) and Xu Mingzhi (11). The team's other ace, Chen Linjian, was 1-6 in FGs to score only two points.By contrast, six of Shanxi's players reached double-digits in scoring. Zhou Zhandong had 12 points, four rebounds, nine assists and three steals. His orchestrating added great mobility to Shanxi's offense which Fujian found difficult to contain.In the last two games on Sunday night, the Zhejiang Lions pocketed a big win over the Shanghai Sharks. The Lions' star pair Sun Minghui and Hu Jinqiu together put down 72 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists.

The 23-year-old from Brooklyn became the unified lightweight champion and managed to do what few in boxing thought he could do â outbox perhaps the best technician in boxing.Lopez (16-0) added the three titles held by Lomachenko (15-2) to the belt he won last year to become the undisputed 135-champion.Lopez was favored 119-109, 117-111 and 116-112 on ringside scorecards in a bout held without fans at the MGM Grand conference center. The Associated Press had Lopez winning 117-111.Lopez proved faster and stronger than the 32-year-old Lomachenko, who won two Olympic gold medals as an amateur and was regarded as one of the top pound-for-pound fighters as a pro. Surprisingly enough, he was also the better boxer and proved he could close the show by bloodying Lomachenko's eye in the 12th round."I had to dig deep, man," Lopez said. "I'm a fighter, I've got to dig in deep."Lomachenko, ordinarily a slow starter, was too slow this time as he gave away rounds early as he tried to figure out the style of Lopez. By the time the fight got competitive in the eighth round he was too far behind to come back."He's been in a 14-month layoff," Lopez said. "I knew it was going to take him a long time to catch up."Lomachenko, who lost only once in nearly 400 amateur fights and had only one loss as a pro, thought he did better than the scorecards indicated."Definitely I am not agreeing with the scorecards," he said.The fight was the biggest since the pandemic began and would have been a pay-per-view event in normal times. But with no fans it was televised on ESPN, providing boxing with a bigger showcase than it would have gotten otherwise.Lomachenko was a 4-1 favorite but looked rusty early as he tried to solve the style of Lopez. He threw punches only sparingly the first half of the fight, landing just 31 punches in the first seven rounds, before finally picking up the pace in the eighth round."I think the first half of the fight he got more rounds than I did but in the second half of the fight I took over," Lomachenko said. "I was much better."Punch statistics showed Lopez landed 183 of 659 punches while Lomachenko was credited with 141 of 321. In the 12th round Lopez outlanded Lomachenko 50 to 19 and opened up a cut that sent blood flowing down his face and prompted referee Russell Mora to stop the fight with 10 seconds left to have the ring doctor look at it before resuming.Lopez was told by his father in the corner before the 12th round that he was ahead and not to risk anything. But he came out strong and beat Lomachenko to the punch."I didn't know if they had him up on the scorecards or not," Lopez said.Lopez did his trademark backflip in the ring after the unanimous decision was announced.Lopez became the youngest fighter to become a four-belt champion in only his second title fight. He had sought the fight against Lomachenko, angering the Ukrainian with his brash tactics."I love to fight and I can bang too," Lopez said.

skaters from Africa, the Americas, Asia and Oceania, the International Skating Union (ISU) announced on Friday.That will make Tianjin the second city on the Chinese mainland to stage the renowned Four Continents Championships, which was held in Beijing back in 2003. The annual event was scheduled to take place in Sydney, Australia, before the world championships next year, but was called off by the

either a positive test or close contact with someone who has tested positive.Also, Mauro had just completed a five-game ban for using performance-enhancing substances.In addition, 12 players from the Jaguars practice squad were placed onto the COVID-19 reserve list after one tested positive, prompting the closing of the team training facility.The reserves are together and apart from active players

showed up wearing her regular No. 5 jersey with the team at a pre-season charity match in Tianjin on Saturday.Having spearheaded the team for their 12th CVL title without conceding a single match last season, Zhu had listed Tianjin as her top choice for the upcoming new season, which is scheduled to take off in a tournament format in Jiangmen, southeast China's Guangdong Province on November 12. "Thanks to our last season's cooperation, I've developed really good relationships with my teammates as well as the club. I look forward to my future cooperation with the team," said Zhu, who won her first domestic league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) with Tianjin last year.Before joining Tianjin last season, the 25-year-old Chinese spiker had an incredible ride at the Turkish women's volleyball club Vakifbank Istanbul for three seasons, sweeping a haul of trophies, including the esteemed FIVB Club World Championships and CEV Champions League. She pressed the pause button for her overseas journey last year, joining Tianjin Bohai Bank and playing at China's domestic volleyball league all for one goal in mind â 2020 Tokyo Olympics.That goal also plays a crucial factor in her choice to stay with the Tianjin team. The coaching staff Zhu works with at the Tianjin Bohai Bank, many of them are part of the national team's coaching squad. And some of Zhu's teammates at Team Tianjin, such as Yao Di and Li Yingying, are also national team players who will fight with Zhu in Tokyo.Lang Ping, the head coach of China's women's national volleyball team, has been considerate in giving advice upon Zhu's joining of Tianjin."Coach Lang told me to follow the team's instructions and finish training and all kinds of tasks as planned by the team. At the same time, I should go and communicate whenever I have sustained an injury," said Zhu."She also encouraged me to reach a level of communications with the team where we are familiar with each other's needs."Due to her right wrist's injury, Zhu has taken an eight-week-long break and thus missed out on the Chinese Women's Volleyball Championships which concluded earlier this month. Working on getting back on court, Zhu is optimistic about her recovery and has tremendous trust on the club's physiotherapist Daniel Wai Hong, who is also the therapist with the national team."I will gradually get back my form through each game and work with Daniel to make plans. He can really help me achieve many impossible tasks, and I think I will be fine," said Zhu.Tianjin Bohai Bank claimed league championship last season, and with Zhu, it is on course to their 13th league title. However, Zhu has set her vision beyond securing another domestic crown."Everything is for the Olympics, no matter it is the game or the training," said Zhu. "We need to work on our weaknesses through this domestic league competition as well as the training session leading up to the Olympics."(Cover image: Zhu Ting stand with teammates during a preseason charity volleyball game of the 2020-2021 Chinese Volleyball Super League in Tianjin, China, October 17, 2020. /VCG)China's women's national volleyball team captain and superstar spiker Zhu Ting will continue representing Tianjin Bohai Bank for the Chinese Volleyball Super League (CVL)'s new season as she showed up wearing her regular No. 5 jersey with the team at a pre-season charity match in Tianjin on Saturday.Having spearheaded the team for their 12th CVL title without conceding a single match last season, Zhu had listed Tianjin as her top choice for the upcoming new season, which is scheduled to take off in a tournament format in Jiangmen, southeast China's Guangdong Province on November 12. "Thanks to our last season's cooperation, I've developed really good relationships with my teammates as well as the club.

He broke into Beijing's goal area after a series of quick passes with Pelle and RÃ³ger Guedes. Having drawn the most attention of Beijing's defenders, Hao passed the ball to Jin Jingdao, who made it 2-0 for Shandong.Beijing received a penalty too in the 49th minute after Bakambu fell in the box. However, judging by replay, no one touched him at all when he was competing for the ball with Shandong's goalkeeper Wang Dalei. Bakambu made the penalty himself.Then in the 69th minute, Bakambu scored his second goal of the game by heading Li Lei's cross into the net. The game ended in a draw, but Shandong's players were not happy about the process's result. The foul on Bakambu was not the only thing that upset Shandong. At least three referee calls against them in the second half did not make sense to the team."Is this how you want to play it?

I believe I now am ready to coach," said Payton in a phone interview on Thursday. "A lot of young NBA players are a voice away from reaching their true potential. I would like to join an NBA staff where I can help coach, mentor and guide players toward the hard work, focus and determination needed to become a reliable contributor to a team's success."As a guy who played 17 years in the league and has worked as a commentator in TNT and NBATV for years, Payton has his own views of the game. "My rookie year was a rude awakening to the type of talent and competition on the NBA level. That summer and every year after I worked extremely hard to get better at all facets of my game. (Coaches) Tim Grgurich, George Karl, Eric Hughes were the extra voices that helped me become an All-Star, NBA champion and a member of the Hall of Fame."The Seattle SuperSonics (today's Oklahoma City Thunder) selected 20-year-old Payton from Oregon State University with the second overall pick in the 1990 NBA Draft. It took him four years refining himself from a young hot head into an All-Star. In the 10 seasons between 1993 and 2003, Payton was nine-time All-Star (the All-Star Weekend was can celled in the compressed 1998-99 campaign), nine-time All-NBA Team, nine-time All-Defensive First Team and Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) in 1996. He is the only DPOY point guard in NBA history.Payton's nickname "The Glove" became increasingly popular after he took Kevin Johnson apart in the Western Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns. Johnson later praised him in the following way: "You think of guys with great hands, like Maurice Cheeks and Derek Harper. Gary is like that. But he's also a great individual defender and a great team defender. He has all three components covered. That's very rare."Unlike many great defenders, Payton also had first-class offensive skills and was a top five orchestrator in the 1990s. He was a sharp slasher and a post-up master. Moreover, Payton and Shawn "Reign Man" Kemp made the most explosive alley-oop in league history before Chris Paul and Blake Griffin.The other signature of Payton's game was his trash talk. He had countless ways of "discussing" with every member of the opponent's family tree once he stepped onto the court and, more importantly, Payton never shut up. Here are some of the words we could write in a proper report:"Get someone out here who can guard me!" Payton to the bench of Stanford Cardinal."Man, you won't even be in the league next year." Payton to Jamie Feick of the Charlotte Hornets."Paper." Payton to John Stockton of the Utah Jazz every time he made a shot in front of the NBA All-Time assist and steal leader in one game in 1996.

Payton to Kenny Anderson of the New Jersey Nets."You gonna go home and cry." Payton to Jason Kidd in their old days in Oakland.Let's hope his players have strong character when Payton becomes a coach.Another Hall of Fame point guard has expressed interest in coaching an NBA team: Gary Payton told Yahoo Sports that he's passionate about and available to join a coaching staff."I have had conversations in the past about coaching, but the timing wasn't right. I believe I now am ready to coach," said Payton in a phone interview on Thursday. "A lot of young NBA players are a voice away from reaching their true potential. I would like to join an NBA staff where I can help coach, mentor and guide players toward the hard work, focus and determination needed to become a reliable contributor to a team's success."As a guy who played 17 years in the league and has worked as a commentator in TNT and NBATV for years, Payton has his own views of the game. "My rookie year was a rude awakening to the type of talent and competition on the NBA level. That summer and every year after I worked extremely hard to get better at all facets of my game. (Coaches) Tim Grgurich, George Karl, Eric Hughes were the extra voices that helped me become an All-Star, NBA champion and a member of the Hall of Fame."The Seattle SuperSonics (today's Oklahoma City Thunder) selected 20-year-old Payton from Oregon State University with the second overall pick in the 1990 NBA Draft. It took him four years refining himself from a young hot head into an All-Star. In the 10 seasons between 1993 and 2003, Payton was nine-time All-Star (the All-Star Weekend was can celled in the compressed 1998-99 campaign), nine-time All-NBA Team, nine-time All-Defensive First Team and Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) in 1996. He is the only DPOY point guard in NBA history.Payton's nickname "The Glove" became increasingly popular after he took Kevin Johnson apart in the Western Conference Finals against the Phoenix Suns. Johnson later praised him in the following way: "You think of guys with great hands, like Maurice Cheeks and Derek Harper. Gary is like that. But he's also a great individual defender and a great team defender. He has all three components covered. That's very rare."Unlike many great defenders, Payton also had first-class offensive skills and was a top five orchestrator in the 1990s. He was a sharp slasher and a post-up master. Moreover, Payton and Shawn "Reign Man" Kemp made the most explosive alley-oop in league history before Chris Paul and Blake Griffin.The other signature of Payton's game was his trash talk. He had countless ways of "discussing" with every member of the opponent's family tree once he stepped onto the court and, more importantly, Payton never shut up. Here are some of the words we could write in a proper report:"Get someone out here who can guard me!" Payton to the bench of Stanford Cardinal."Man, you won't even be in the league next year." Payton to Jamie Feick of the Charlotte Hornets."Paper." Payton to John Stockton of the Utah Jazz every time he made a shot in front of the NBA All-Time assist and steal leader in one game in 1996.

Everything I did was authorized."He is currently quarantined at his home in Turin after travelling from Portugal in an air ambulance. "I am continuing my quarantine, I am alone, my family is on another floor, we can't be in contact and it will be like that at least for the next 10 days," the 35-year-old added. Local health authorities in the Piedmont region said that prosecutors had been informed of the departure of Ronaldo and other Juve players to join their respective national teams while the Italian champions were in isolation following two COVID-19 cases among the team's non-playing staff. Juventus said on Thursday that Ronaldo, who claims to not have the "slightest symptom", returned to Italy in a "medical flight authorized by the competent health authorities". The entire Juve team were back in isolation on Wednesday evening after U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie tested positive. Both McKennie and Ronaldo are in quarantine and must test negative before rejoining their teammates. Under UEFA rules a player must provide evidence that he is no longer sick a week before a European match. Ronaldo, who will miss Juve's Serie A match with Crotone and their Champions League opener against Dynamo Kiev on October 20, must test negative on October 21 to play against Barcelona and old foe Lionel Messi a week later. (With input from agencies)Cristiano Ronaldo shot back at Italy's sports minister on Friday by denying that he broke the coronavirus protocol adopted for the country's football after returning from international duty while positive for the disease. On Thursday Minister of Sport Vincenzo Spadafora said that Portugal captain Ronaldo had broken protocol after he left isolation with his club Juventus to join up with his national team and then returned to Italy following his positive test. "I never broke the protocol," Ronaldo said during an interview on Instagram, "I followed all the protocols and I will continue to follow them, my conscience is clear ...

"In the next couple of years, I'm sure we'll get the best out of him."Meanwhile, United skipper Harry Maguire is keen to play on and overcome his poor recent displays for club and country but could miss the Newcastle game with a knock, Solskjaer added.Maguire endured a torrid time in United's 6-1 thrashing by Tottenham Hotspur before the international break and sustained an injury before being sent off in England's 1-0 Nations League defeat by Denmark on Wednesday.But Solskjaer backed the 27-year-old, who also featured in England's 2-1 win over Belgium, to give his critics a fitting response if he is fit enough to play this weekend."When Harry is part of the England team that beats number one-ranked Belgium it's a normal day. Then you get the headlines when you get a sending off, that's football. You have to deal with it," Solskjaer told reporters."Harry has got great resilience. He knows he will bounce back. He wants to play and work his way out of the last couple of games he's been criticized for."But he picked up a knock just before he came off the other night so we'll have a look at him today."United's defeat by Spurs left them in 16th place with three points from as many matches and Solskjaer said his players were ready to turn their fortunes around."We know we've started the season badly and that game ended really badly... we know we have to perform better but we've now had two weeks to think about it, work on it," Solskjaer said.Manchester United have triggered a one-year option on Paul Pogba's contract, extending the France midfielder's deal until June 2022, British media reported on Friday.The 27-year-old returned to United from Juventus in a then world-record deal worth 89 million pounds (114.93 million U.S. dollars) in 2016 but Pogba has suffered with inconsistent form and injuries at Old Trafford amidst constant speculation over his future.The reports said United's decision to extend his contract was taken before Pogba said on international duty with France that he would love to play for Real Madrid one day.United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brushed off those comments from the Frenchman, who would have been out of contract next June, during his news conference on the eve of Saturday's Premier League clash at Newcastle United."Paul's our player, he's going to be here for another two years and sure he's focused on doing his best for us and we want to see the best for Paul," Solskjaer said.

Races have been held with teams operating in isolated bubbles and with regular testing.The total number of races was cut to 17 from the record 22 originally envisaged and the first eight races of the season were held without spectators.

shrugged off any lingering fatigue to score twice in his second game in 48 hours as Paris Saint-Germain defeated 10-man Nimes 4-0 on Friday to take over top spot in Ligue 1.The France forward struck the opener on 32 minutes at the Stade des Costieres and netted again late on as a weary Nimes folded following the early dismissal of center-back Loick Landre.Alessandro Florenzi scored PSG's second on 77 minutes and Pablo Sarabia notched a fourth for the reigning champions as PSG climbed above Rennes on goal difference after a fifth successive win."I spoke with Kylian yesterday, he told me that he felt good and that he absolutely wanted to play," said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel."He's the guy who can always make a difference and he did just that."New signings Moise Kean and Rafinha made their PSG debuts with a host of players missing following the international break and just four days ahead of the visit of Manchester United in the Champions League.Ander Herrera, cleared to return after a positive Covid-19 test, drew the first in a series of superb saves from Nimes goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet having replaced the injured Paredes.But Mbappe gave PSG the lead after he was played through by Rafinha, rounding the advancing Reynet before slotting in his third league goal of the campaign.  Everton loanee Kean should have added a second but was denied by an alert Reynet, with Idrissa Gueye and Florenzi also testing the Nimes keeper.Florenzi rattled the post twice in the second half, with a volley and header, but the Italy defender eventually gave PSG room to breathe as he nodded in Sarabia's header back across goal.Mbappe promptly grabbed his second of the night with another nerveless finish after Sarabia shredded a tiring Nimes defence.The Spaniard then caught out the hosts from a quickly-taken free-kick to smack in a fourth through the legs of Reynet two minutes from the end. Earlier, Rennes extended their unbeaten start to the Ligue 1 season despite drawing 1-1 at bottom side Dijon.Lille or Lens could overtake PSG and Rennes with victory in Sunday's Derby du Nord, the first such fixture in over five years.(With input from AFP)Kylian Mbappe shrugged off any

Beginning with the cancellation of the 2020 world championships slated early this year in Montreal, the Grand Prix Final, which has been originally scheduled for December 10 to 13 in Beijing as one of the test events for Beijing 2022 has also been postponed. This Wednesday, Skate Canada, the second stop of the six-event Grand Prix series was also scrapped due to the health and safety concerns over the COVID-19. Lucky to remain on the calendar, the Cup of China will become the only event for ISU to stage in China this year. It will also be the 18th year for China to host the event served as one leg of ISU's figure skating Grand Prix series. "Due to the coronavirus pandemic this year, our skaters had few competition opportunities. That made our team only look forward to and cherish the upcoming Cup of China," said Zhao Hongbo, head coach of the Chinese figure skating team. "The Chinese team is now working hard to make preparations in Beijing. All the skaters will try their best in Chongqing."Thanks to the ISU's decision to downsize this season's Grand Prix events to more localized events with mainly domestic skaters and skaters who train in the host country to participate, the Cup of China has seen a sharp decrease in the number of this year's participants. It will only feature one group of skaters in each competing category, which means only four free skating pairs, six male skaters, six female skaters together with five ice dance pairs will compete at the Cup of China. At the ladies' group, only China's ace female skater Chen Hongyi has automatically qualified and confirmed her participation. China's two young female skates Lin Shan and Zhu Yi are expected to participate at Skate America as they are currently training overseas.(Cover image: Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China perform at the Gala Exhibition during day three of the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Cup of China at Huaxi Sports Center in Chongqing, China, November 10, 2019. /VCG)Amid uncertainties and challenges imposed by the COVID-19, the 2020 Cup of China, third event of this season's International Skating Union (ISU) Figure Skating Grand Prix Series will finally be staged from November 6 to 8 in Chongqing, the same host city as in last year's event.At the event's news conference held in Chongqing on Thursday, all the skaters who have already confirmed to participate have been revealed. Two-time world pairs champions Sui Wenjing and Han Cong, together with two-time world bronze medalist Jin Boyang led the squad, which is also joined by new stars such as two-time Grand Prix Final silver medalists Peng Cheng and Jin Yang, as well as Wang Shiyue and Liu Xinyu as China's promising ice dancer pairs. Since the coronavirus pandemic began to wreak havoc early this year, the international figure skating community has been hit hard. Beginning with the cancellation of the 2020 world championships slated early this year in Montreal, the Grand Prix Final, which has been originally scheduled for December 10 to 13 in Beijing as one of the test events for Beijing 2022 has also been postponed. This Wednesday, Skate Canada, the second stop of the six-event Grand Prix series was also scrapped due to the health and safety concerns over the COVID-19. Lucky to remain on the calendar, the Cup of China will become the only event for ISU to stage in China this year. It will also be the 18th year for China to host the event served as one leg of ISU's figure skating Grand Prix series. "Due to the coronavirus pandemic this year, our skaters had few competition opportunities.

In an interview with Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday, Li talked about his experience of coaching the national team, his expectations on the new CBA career and views over youth development.Li was appointed as team consultant of Jiangsu in May. Three months later, he became the new head coach of the team. Having finished the last season with a disappointing 17-29 record, Jiangsu are not only young â with an average age only 22 years old â but also little-known. Therefore, Li's job can be very challenging."It does give me a feeling of starting over coming to Jiangsu," said Li. "I was first player and then coach during my 23-, 24-year-long domestic career, but I did not have much experience of coaching top-level games or competitions close to top level. That's why I think it's time for me to start over at a club to collect more experience.""Our team has a lot of young men and only one or two 'older ones.' That means some of the young guys will appear in the starting lineup. Some of them will stay longer than others on the court. Maybe some of the boys are not ready yet, but that's where we are right now."Young blood never lacks passion or fighting spirit, but these are just uncut diamonds who still need time to refine their skills."We need rules both in practice and in the game. I want them to act on their own as long as they follow my forms. I don't want to make excessive demand on everything they do.â"Today's kids lack practice. â¦ I want to increase their practice time to make up for it. Second, I want help them learn how to fear no hardships and how not to give up in front of setbacks. These can all be done via daily training and management."It will take longer for people to forget China's failure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup at home in 2019. As the team's head coach, Li was questioned the most over his choice of rotation and timeouts."I think every coach has his own style and habit for calling timeout and deciding rotation. For example, I did not make that substitution at that moment but I couldn't say 'I should have done that' after the game. â¦ You can't do everything as others expect. They question you because they pay more attention to the result."Having coached the national team for over two years, Li generalized China's problems into two: lack of tough-battle experience and inferior individual ability."We played too little with European teams or stronger American teams, like only very few games a year. It's not the same as playing warm-up games at home. We need to go overseas and attend more competitions like the NBA Summer League or the contests in Europe. Ideally, you train for three or four weeks and then play three or four games. Then you start training again and do the same repeatedly. But our team cannot do this because of many difficulties.""When we say a player 'carries his own system,' like LeBron James, it means wherever he goes, the team plays in his way. Our national team does not have guys like that. We have no Sonny Weems or Jeremy Lin. We always say we play as a team, but how? What is our style? Our players' ability defines team's style. For China, I think passing is still our problem. So is penetrating. We used to call guys who can slash with absolute speed 'sharp blade.' Now we don't have enough of those players."Then what can Chinese players do to solve this problem? Li believes the key lies in making players ask more of themselves. "Chinese players, especially the young ones, are too easily satisfied and lack sense of competition. Without sense of competition, they can't find motivation. They are too comfortable in the clubs. They fall short of the best but are better than the worst. That can't be good for players. That's why I kept telling my guys: you need to want to get better before we can help you.

The fact that they won it in misfortune year only made the title even more special.While everyone was happy, the Lakers' front office may need to leave the parties behind, sit back in front of the desk and figure out how to deal with their current lineup.Anthony DavisThough he was not the Finals MVP, the fact is, the arrival of Davis brought the purple and gold Larry O'Brien Trophy this season. He still has one year (about $28.8 million) left of his current contract and he can choose to opt out of it. If he does, Davis will become an unrestricted free agent and can sign a new five-year deal worth $189.9 million with the Lakers.Hold on that thought because there are other ways to further maximize Davis' earnings. First, he can sign a 1+1 contract and opt out again in 2021 summer to sign a new extension. However, considering that the salary cap may not grow much next year, the increase of Davis' income will still be limited.ESPN's expert Bobby Marks suggested that Davis sign a 2+1 contract with the Lakers and opt out of it in 2022 summer. There will be several benefits via doing so. First, Davis will be qualified for Designated Veteran Player Extension, which is also known as a supermax deal. If the NBA revenues return to normal in 2022, Davis can sign a five-year contract worth $243.6 million with the team.LeBron JamesJames received the fourth Finals MVP of his for good reasons. He led in average points (29.8), rebounds (11.8), true shooting percentage (67.1) and effective field goal percentage (65.7) of the two teams' major rotations during the series. James still has two years ($39.2 million and $41 million) left of his current deal with the Lakers.The purple and gold have the right to extend James contract this summer by another two years, paying him $43 million and $46.5 million in the last two years. Despite his incredible performance this season, James is turning 36 years old in December. Leading the team to win the 17th title definitely deserves reward. The Lakers will need to decide how much the reward should be.Others with player optionThe following four guys have player option during the off-season: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, JaVale McGee and Avery Bradley.Averaging 8.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.0 steals during the Finals did not tell how important Rondo was to the Lakers. He is the team's second orchestrator, bond of perimeter defense and ball distributor in half-court offense.According to Chris Sheridan of BasketballNews.com, Rondo will understandably opt out of the $2.7-million deal of his to become an unrestricted player. Judging by his performance in the playoffs and his old age (34 year), it should not be hard for Rondo to get a two-year, $16-million deal.Pope averaged 12.8 points, the third-highest of the Lakers during the Finals. His defense of Duncan Robinson was very impressive. Though his 30.3-percent 3-point rate was not pretty but Pope took 43 triple attempts, the most of the team and made 13 of them, the second most of the purple and gold. He fit well playing along James.Pope's contract will pay him $8.5 million next year. If he opts out of it, he may receive a similar number of average annual salary.Neither McGee nor Bradley got much chance in the bubble in Orlando. If McGee opts out of his contract, he should still be able to find a new job thanks to his size, athleticism and finishing ability. Bradley, by contrast, may not be that lucky.The Lakers won't have much cap space even if they let all of the four go. Usually champions don't change their franchise by too much, figuring out how keeping (some of) the aforementioned guys may be a smart option.

Ajan had been at the IWF for 44 years as general secretary and president. Richard McLaren, the Canadian law professor whose findings in July 2016 led to Russia being banned from all international athletic competitions, including the Rio Olympics, told reporters in June that the IWF was rife with corruption. This included vote buying, doping cover-ups and $10.4 million in cash that cannot be accounted for.

However, it's still unclear what those activities will be.Vegas was not the only city saw its event postponed. New Orleans, which was supposed to host Super Bowl LVIII in 2024, will have to wait one more year to witness Super Bowl take place at the New Orleans Saints' Mercedes-Benz Superdome for the eighth time.As the NFL will extend the regular season to 17 games from next year, Super Bowl will be one week later than usual as well. That will put the 2024 event on February 13, bringing it into conflict with New Orleans' Mardi Gras event; hence the league's decision.According to CNBC, the NFL will decide next year over the location for 2024 Super Bowl.

This virtual recognition of the season's finest players will provide fans the opportunity to celebrate the accomplishments of their favorite stars." However, it's still unclear what those activities will be.Vegas was not the only city saw its event postponed. New Orleans, which was supposed to host Super Bowl LVIII in 2024, will have to wait one more year to witness Super Bowl take place at the New Orleans Saints' Mercedes-Benz Superdome for the eighth time.As the NFL will extend the regular season to 17 games from next year, Super Bowl will be one week later than usual as well. That will put the 2024 event on February 13, bringing it into conflict with New Orleans' Mardi Gras event; hence the league's decision.According to CNBC, the NFL will decide next year over the location for 2024 Super Bowl. "We anticipate interest from Las Vegas and other cities around the country to host America's most popular even," said an NFL spokesperson.By the way Super Bowl will take place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and State Farm Stadium in Arizona in 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively.Harry Maguire's miserable start to the season continued with a red card as England had two men sent off for the first time in their Nations League defeat by Denmark, while Kylian Mbappe gave World Cup holders France a 2-1 victory in Croatia and Portugal won without Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday.Christian Eriksen's penalty on his 100th appearance for Denmark earned his side a 1-0 win over England in their Nations League clash at Wembley.Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eriksen powered his spot-kick past Jordan Pickford in the 35th minute, a couple of minutes after England center-back Harry Maguire had received a red card for a second booking.The defeat ended a run of nine successive home wins for England, who beat top-ranked Belgium on Sunday, while Denmark, who have lost just two of their last 40 international matches, celebrated their first victory over England at Wembley since 1983.England slipped to third place in Group A2 which is now headed by Belgium with Denmark above England on goal difference."Disappointed to lose the match but extremely proud of how we responded to going down to 10 men," said England manager Gareth Southgate, who rather surprisingly opted not to send on Aston Villa's creative midfielder Jack Grealish when chasing the game."We had a few chances that on another day would have gone in. The 10 men changes the game and they get a soft penalty."While it was a memorable night for Danish playmaker Eriksen, it was a disappointing one for England who suffered only their second home defeat in 32 competitive internationals.Mbappe strike gives France 2-1 win in CroatiaFrance stretched their unbeaten run against Croatia to eight games after a late goal by Kylian Mbappe gave the World Cup holders a 2-1 win in their Nations League top-tier Group 3 match on Wednesday.The result left France second in the group on 10 points from four games, behind Portugal on goal difference after the European champions brushed aside Sweden 3-0. Croatia have three points and the Swedes none.France beat Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 World Cup final before defeating them by the same score in last month's reverse Nations League fixture."We knew we'd be in a real battle," France coach Didier Deschamps told French TF1 television."We started very well and it's a pity we didn't go two goals clear as Kylian had a big chance. We did what we needed to do in the second half."It's not because we won a trophy in 2018 that you win by clicking your fingers. You have to look at the way the opponents play too."Croatia defender Dejan Lovren rued his team's concentration lapses."France are ruthlessly efficient and they will punish you every time you switch off, even for a split second," he told reporters."Playing against them is very frustrating because you can be as entertaining as you like but to no avail. The three points is all that matters."Portugal brush off Ronaldo absence to outclass SwedenGoals from Bernardo Silva and a brace from Diogo Jota gave Portugal a comfortable 3-0 win over Sweden in the Nations League on Wednesday as the hosts made light of the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo due to a positive COVID-19 test.With 10 points from four games, Portugal top Group 2 in League A on goal difference ahead of France, who beat Croatia 2-1 in Zagreb. The Swedes are bottom of the group after slumping to four straight defeats."We were not asked to play any differently [without Ronaldo], our ambition remains the same," Manchester United's Portuguese midfielder Bruno Fernandes told reporters."The team has great values but it is obvious that it is easier to win with the best in the world."(With input from agencies)Harry Maguire's miserable start to the season continued with a red card as England had two men sent off for the first time in their Nations League defeat by Denmark, while Kylian Mbappe gave World Cup holders France a 2-1 victory in Croatia and Portugal won without Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday.Christian Eriksen's penalty on his 100th appearance for Denmark earned his side a 1-0 win over England in their Nations League clash at Wembley.Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eriksen powered his spot-kick past Jordan Pickford in the 35th minute, a couple of minutes after England center-back Harry Maguire had received a red card for a second booking.The defeat ended a run of nine successive home wins for England, who beat top-ranked Belgium on Sunday, while Denmark, who have lost just two of their last 40 international matches, celebrated their first victory over England at Wembley since 1983.England slipped to third place in Group A2 which is now headed by Belgium with Denmark above England on goal difference."Disappointed to lose the match but extremely proud of how we responded to going down to 10 men," said England manager Gareth Southgate, who rather surprisingly opted not to send on Aston Villa's creative midfielder Jack Grealish when chasing the game."We had a few chances that on another day would have gone in.

The 28-year-old denied the wrongdoing and stressed his innocence. "I feel I am already seen as a sinner of doping, but I am not," Wanjiru said when he heard of his provisional suspension. "I am innocent."According to the AIU's disciplinary report on Wanjiru, the international athlete accepted a "volunteer provisional suspension" in December 2019, agreeing not to race until the final outcome of the case was delivered. Because of this, the four-year ban has been backdated to the day of his original suspension on December 9 last year, which means he won't be allowed to compete again until December 2023. Wanjiru rose to fame after beating Kenenisa Bekele to the 2017 London Marathon title. He was also the winner at the Amsterdam Marathon in 2016, where he set his marathon PB at 2:05:21.In addition to his ban, all results Wanjiru recorded from March 9, 2019, the date when the test was taken, will be disqualified including forfeiture of any medals, titles, ranking points and prize and appearance money.Kenyan long-distance runner Daniel Wanjiru was banned for four years by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) on Wednesday following an Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) violation. He was provisionally suspended in April for "use of a prohibited substance/method" after "abnormalities" were found in his biological passport.

Public gatherings, indoors and outdoors, with more than four people are no longer allowed.The new measures will stay in place for at least four weeks, starting Wednesday. In two weeks, the government will evaluate the situation to see whether the rules should be loosened or tightened.In he past seven days, 43,903 people tested positive for COVID-19, an increase of almost 60 percent compared with the week before, while 150 people died, compared with 89 the week before.Iolo ap Dafydd in London Millions of people in the north of England from today are living under stricter conditions as a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic grips the UK.The government's new three-tier system has been implemented, with in Liverpool city and the surrounding region placed on the highest third tier, which could last for three weeks. It's not a total lockdown, as schools, universities and retail shops stay open. Pubs and bars not selling food have to close, so do other businesses where social distancing is difficult.  For now, the rest of the country is in tier one and two, but areas such as Greater Manchester, the North East, south Yorkshire and parts of the Midlands could follow if infections keeps increasing.The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said it was "disappointing" how the Conservative government is "piling the pressure" on his region "without negotiating."The political clash between the UK's right-wing government and center-left opposition parties, including the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland, is deepening. The main opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has called for a two- to three-week national lockdown in England, to try to break the viral cycle. Mark Drakeford, Wales's Labour first minister has repeatedly called for those living in high COVID-19 areas of England not to visit Wales, where local lockdowns are in place.The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasnât endorsed that and argues the English system is a "moderate" and "balanced" approach to saving lives and protecting the economy at the same time.Mia Alberti in FrankfurtGermany reached yet another record of daily coronavirus cases since April, having registered 5,132 new infections on Wednesday. The total number of positive tests is now 334,585, according to the Robert Koch Institute. There were also 40 more deaths, a substantial increase compared with previous days. The death toll now stands at 9,677.This comes as Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to meet with German state leaders to discuss further restrictions. The meeting will be held in person for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, showing the urgency felt by the chancellor to curb the exponential increase in cases of the past few weeks.   FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: Chinese mainland reports 20 new COVID-19 casesCGTN America: New York Philharmonic cancels 2020/21 season CGTN Africa: Uganda authorities caution parents against issuing sanitizers to learnersSign up here to get the COVID-19 Europe bulletin sent directly to your inboxCGTN Europe has been providing in-depth coverage of the novel coronavirus story as it has unfolded. Here you can read the essential information about the crisis.Miu Hirano, who won women's singles title for Japan at the Table Tennis World Cup in 2016, decided to quit the upcoming ITTF World Tour Grand Finals because of lower back pain, announced her management company on Tuesday.

According to Hollinger, the league will give teams eight-week-notice ahead of the start of the season, which will be November 23.Postponing the beginning of the season was just the first step and more will follow. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is still far from under control in the U.S., should the league continue to put all games in a bubble? It's true that it worked behind closed doors in Orlando but let's face it: only 20 teams entered the bubble for eight regular season games and 16 of them attended the playoffs. What will happen if all 30 teams have to finish an 82-game regular season in a bubble (or multiple ones)?The trouble is not over. The NBA wants to bring fans back to the games as much as fans want to do the same. If the new season will take place in a bubble, the league will have to get creative in figuring out how to allow fans in while ensuring the bubble's safety.The MLB may offer the NBA an example to follow as the baseball league put several straight games in one place to slim down teams' time on the road and speed up the season. The NBA must watch out for two things if it wants to introduce that mechanism: first, read carefully the traveling restrictions of the Canadian government for the sake of the Toronto Raptors; second, determine the length of the season (the MLB cut it from 162 games to 60).There's also the problem with the Tokyo Olympics, which has already been postponed to July 2021. Basically, it's impossible for the NBA to finish the whole season before that and even if it somehow does it, one can't expect the best players to join the national team for Tokyo right after an exhausting competition. Either way, it seems unlikely for Team USA to get vengeance for their painful failure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in China in 2019 this time.The 2020 NBA Draft, like the beginning of the new season, was also postponed (to November 18). After that, the free agency market will open, followed by the training camps and then the 2020-21 season.The new NBA season, which should be the 2020-21 campaign, may only happen in 2021 â John Hollinger of The Athletic reported that the new season will begin on January 18, 2021.That means the NBA will return on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and there won't be Christmas Day games.

A game postponed and rescheduled with a second pushed back. Only one practice with two walk-throughs and unrelenting criticism.The Titans remain depleted. They're also still undefeated.Ryan Tannehill threw for three touchdowns and ran for another as the Titans routed the Buffalo Bills 42-16 on a rare Tuesday night in a showdown between two of the NFL's five remaining undefeated teams pushed back two days after a couple more positive tests for Tennessee last week."What this organization has been through over the past couple weeks to really fight through all of that, shake it all off, really limited practice, limited reps and go out and put this kind of win together, I think makes a statement and I'm happy we were able to do that today," Tannehill said.The Titans (4-0) continued their best start since winning their first 10 games in 2008 despite not playing their last game September 27 in Minnesota. Coach Mike Vrabel said everyone in the organization would get a game ball after this performance."I learned a long time ago that the definition of a pro is they make the hard look easy, so whatever situation we're presented with we got to all come together and make the best decisions for the team each and every time," Vrabel said.Malcolm Butler intercepted two passes, the second he returned 68 yards, and both set up short touchdowns for Tennessee. Kareem Orr's recovery of a fumbled kickoff set up Tannehill's fourth TD for 21 points off Buffalo's three turnovers. Kalif Raymond's 40-yard punt return also set up a 1-yard TD run by Derrick Henry."We expected to win," Butler said.The Bills (4-1) had not won five straight games since 2004, and they came in looking for the franchise's best start since 1991 when Buffalo reached the Super Bowl. They also played without starting cornerbacks with Tre'Davious White inactive because of a back injury and Levi Wallace on injured reserve.Starting wide receiver John Brown also was out for Buffalo, which had scored at least 30 points in the past three games."They were ready to go and at the same time we beat ourselves," Bills coach Sean McDermott said.Buffalo center Mitch Morse called this a gut-punch."It's tough, they came out and beat us like a drum," Morse said.Josh Allen came in second in the NFL in yards passing. He threw for 263 yards and two TDs. Stephon Diggs had 10 catches for 106 yards.The Titans needed the turnovers with seven key players on the reserve/COVID-19 list led by wide receivers Corey Davis and Adam Humphries and defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons. They also were missing a couple assistant coaches and two players activated off that reserve list earlier Tuesday were scratched.The Titans got a big boost on the Bills' opening drive.Allen's pass went off Andre Roberts' hands right to Butler, and he returned the interception 29 yards to the Bills 16. Two plays later, Tannehill hit A. J. Brown, who missed the last two games with an injured knee, for a 16-yard TD for the quick lead.The Bills tied it up with a methodical 15-play drive converting four third downs, taking advantage of a Titans' defense playing a pair of rookies in end Larrell Murchison and cornerback Chris Jackson. Allen tossed the ball to Isaiah McKenzie for a 3-yard TD tying it up, the ninth different Bill to catch a TD pass from Allen.The Titans scored 21 of the next 24 points.Tennessee led 21-10 at halftime after Tannehill ran in from 10 yards seconds before the half. Butler refused to go down after picking off an Allen throw to Gabriel Davis late in the third, and Tannehill found Jonnu Smith for a 4-yard TD and a 28-10 lead three plays later.Bills will host Kansas City on Monday night. Safety Micah Hyde denied the Bills got caught looking ahead to the defending Super Bowl champs."No, no, no, no. We were 100 percent focused on the Titans," Hyde said. "We knew this game was going to be played one way or another. It was not looking forward to the Chiefs or anything."Titans will host Texans on Sunday.The Tennessee Titans just put together their most gratifying victory of coach Mike Vrabel's short tenure.They spent the past two weeks dealing with the NFL's first COVID-19 outbreak with each morning bringing news of yet another positive test.

I think the car is obviously outperforming me at the moment because I cannot extract the maximum from the car," he said after completing the maximum 100km allowed."Getting back to the F1 speed is not so easy. I was improving lap after lap and trying to give feedback to the engineers. Also, we had some filming to do, so there were cameras, there were drones following on track."Team boss Cyril Abiteboul said after Sunday's Eifel Grand Prix at Germany's Nuerburgring, where Ricciardo finished third for Renault's first podium since their return as a constructor in 2016, that Alonso was champing to return."We received a message before, during and after the race," said the Frenchman."I think Fernando is like a big shark.

Gavranovic then grabbed his second only for Serge Gnabry to earn Germany a point.The result moves Germany within a point of League A Group Four leaders Spain, who remain on seven points after losing 1-0 away to a Ukraine side now on six points, while the Swiss, still without a win, stay bottom with two points.Germany coach Joachim Loew reverted to a four-man defense for the game in an empty stadium, after they had led in the last four games only to concede equalizers in three of them.But it remained their weak spot on Tuesday as they struggled with quick breaks from the Swiss who found far too much space."It was extremely intense. We started badly but showed great attitude in coming back," Loew said. "That was positive. In defense we made our share of mistakes which we have to stop. But we showed that the team is ready to fight."The Swiss had stunned Germany with Gavranovic's fifth minute header and doubled the lead in the 26th when they intercepted a pass from Toni Kroos, playing in his 100th international, and Freuler beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with a cool chip.Werner hit back for the hosts two minutes later, wrong-footing keeper Yann Sommer with a clever low shot, as the Germans maintained possession and kept pushing forward.Robin Gosens' effort was tipped over the bar by Sommer late in the first half but the keeper was beaten when Havertz charged into the box and fired in the equalizer in the 55th.But Germany's backline kept leaking goals as the Swiss went back in front in the 57th. Neuer made consecutive saves from Haris Seferovic but Gavranovic drilled in on the rebound.A sensational Gnabry back heel flick on the hour pulled the home side level once more and rescued a point for Loew's team.Elsewhere, England striker Harry Kane is fit to start Wednesday's Nations League match against Denmark but defenders Ben Chilwell and Kieran Trippier have withdrawn from the squad, manager Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday.Kane did not start Sunday's 2-1 win over Belgium and only came on as a substitute but Southgate said he was "fully fit" even as Tottenham Hotspur urged England to exercise caution over the striker's workload amid a congested schedule.England are top of Nations League Group A2 with seven points after three games, one point ahead of second-placed Belgium.(With input from agencies)Germany twice had to come from behind to earn a rollercoaster 3-3 draw against visitors Switzerland in an exciting Nations League group game packed with incident in Cologne, Germany on Tuesday.The Swiss took an early lead through Mario Gavranovic and Remo Freuler added a second before goals from Timo Werner and Kai Havertz leveled the scores.

Adapted from real events and told through the lens of volleyball legend Lang Ping, it offers a unique glimpse into some of the contentious issues that have compounded her complicated legacy.And therein lies the novelty."'Leap' is distinguished from other patriotic movies in the way that it treats characters in a rather refreshing way while injecting the story with fresh narratives and far-reaching hints," Jing, a movie reviewer who runs his own review website, told CGTN.In recent years, China's entertainment industry has been flooded with movies featuring historical events effusing patriotic sentiments. Making billions in box-office revenues, these movies are beloved by Chinese cinema-goers.While some of these are repetitive, they serve a purpose. "We do need these movies to convey some messages," said Li Jing, another freelance movie reviewer.But "stories need to be told in a way that characters are fully formed," Li explained. "'Leap' is not perfect, but it shows the effort of focusing the narrative on an intricate character."A standard Chinese patriotic movie tends to emphasize individual sacrifices for the collective, but "Leap" did not follow that path, according to Jing. "I believe Peter Ho-sun Chan, the movie director, was more keen on examining the reconciliation between individual fulfillment and collective interests. It transcends the idea that war-time blockbusters are the only type of movies that audiences like."Lang was an indefatigable player in the national women's team when China was just opening up to the outside world in the 1980s. At a time when patriotism was running high and winning sports events on the global stage signified tremendous national pride, Lang and her team secured thrilling victories â including a world championship title and Olympic gold â that still reverberate across the country.After taking up a coaching career in the U.S. and successfully guiding the U.S. national team to notable victories, she returned to China and was determined to lead the struggling Chinese national team back to its peak. But by then, she was no longer just a patriot elated by winning glory for her country, but had become a seasoned, reserved coach accustomed to both victory or defeat.And "Leap" touches on the contentious theme underlying that change: her questioning of China's sports system, where top athletes are required to devote all their energy to their sport but are not prepared for life after their career is over."'Leap' not only acknowledges the fading trend of patriotism in contemporary China, a cause for the loss of spirit that once motivated athletes of older generations, but also hints at Lang's change in attitude towards volleyball as well as the drawbacks of China's sports system," Jing said. "In this respect, Chan approaches these topics with full honesty."Lang suffered permanent injuries due to strenuous training in her early career as an athlete. Even now, she still holds a disability certificate in the U.S.. But before she left China for an overseas coaching career, she was allegedly refused reimbursement for some costly medical bills by the Chinese volleyball association."Chan is very adept at presenting individualism as the product of our time. One of his signature movies in the 1990s, 'Comrades: Almost a Love Story,' depicts a woman who puts her self-interest above others," said Li."In 'Leap,' we can see the unraveling of the same discussion. Though bound to offend some in the audience, this is the sharp reflection of reality," Li added."Leap" follows a number of other bold and thought-provoking films that have come out in recent years.The 2018 movie "The Shadow Play" by Lou Ye took a sharp look at the pervasive practices of forced relocation. "Dying to survive" by Wen Muye, also released in 2018, offers a critical view of China's medical system."Dearest," another one of Chan's works, provocatively dove into the issues surrounding child abduction and did not shun away from the problematic ramifications of China's birth control policies."These movies turned out to be more popular and often received good reviews," noted Jing."Leap" topped the Chinese box office in the first week of its release and has already made 700 million yuan ($104.19 million) since then.Despite speculation that China's censorship system is tightening its grip on the movie industry, a growing number of movie makers have been toeing the line of what is acceptable to the film censors.Lou Ye, director of "The Shadow Play," is known to have challenged the censorship system for years.

Change is never popular, but sometimes change is necessary," observed English Football League (EFL) chairman Ricky Parry, who has long called for "a complete rethink" over the make-up of the country's football. For Parry, the current situation is dire to say the least. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the sports industry, the EFL was full of poorly-managed clubs with a huge financial hole. "The need for a complete rethinking regarding the funding of English professional football predates the COVID-19 crisis," said Parry, who oversees 72 clubs in the three divisions below the Premier League. "The gap between the Premier League and the EFL has become a chasm which has become unbridgeable for clubs transitioning between the EFL and Premier League," he added. This stance is echoed by Nigel Travis, chairman of League Two side Leyton Orient. "Before the pandemic, 75 percent of clubs were losing money - that can't continue. The pandemic has, if you like, exacerbated the problem and we need to get it fixed," he told BBC in a recent interview. "One thing I need to quash is, this isn't about the pandemic, this is about a crisis in football that goes back many years. If clubs don't get something soon you will see clubs disappear, I would predict, within five-six weeks," Travis predicted. Under such circumstances, a radical reform plan, which has been dubbed 'Project Big Picture' was duly unveiled by EFL over the weekend. According to multiple British media outlets, the plan was mainly devised by Liverpool owner, John W Henry, and the Manchester United chairman, Joel Glazer, while Parry, a lifelong Liverpool fan and former Chief Executive of the club, was the driving force behind it. "It's a day to applaud Liverpool and Manchester United," beamed Parry. "Not to be suspicious, not to be critical, but actually just to look at the nuts and bolts of the plan, which really do stand out. Very clear, very simple. It is about a reset. It is about redistribution."Under the proposals, the Premier League will cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with both the League Cup and Community Shield being abolished. Meanwhile, a 250 million pounds ($325 million) rescue fund will be made immediately available to the EFL, who could sell its broadcast rights alongside those of the top flight and would take 25 percent of the future revenue. Most significantly of all, however, the traditional 'big six' of Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur will be given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, which means only six votes will be required to implement significant changes in the future. It inevitably led to accusations of a power grab and triggered a fierce criticism from the UK government. "It's clear that this proposal does not command support throughout the Premier League - it is exactly this type of backroom dealing that undermines trust in football governance," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also condemned what it called a "backroom deal.""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game," a DCMS spokesperson said. The Premier League later weighed in by releasing a statement saying: "In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support." "Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute," it added.While Parry remained unequivocal in his support of the plan, the seeds of division have already been sowed.  "Some Premier League club are very much against the proposal," a West Ham source was quoted as saying by the BBC. "The big six are using COVID for a power grab. If this goes through, over time they will just use more and more for themselves." But another Premier League club source told the Guardian that he was confident about the prospect of the plan, adding: "Beggars can't be choosers. It is about saving the game from oblivion." "Change is never easy.

Meanwhile, a 250 million pounds ($325 million) rescue fund will be made immediately available to the EFL, who could sell its broadcast rights alongside those of the top flight and would take 25 percent of the future revenue. Most significantly of all, however, the traditional 'big six' of Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur will be given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, which means only six votes will be required to implement significant changes in the future. It inevitably led to accusations of a power grab and triggered a fierce criticism from the UK government. "It's clear that this proposal does not command support throughout the Premier League - it is exactly this type of backroom dealing that undermines trust in football governance," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also condemned what it called a "backroom deal.""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game," a DCMS spokesperson said. The Premier League later weighed in by releasing a statement saying: "In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support." "Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute," it added.While Parry remained unequivocal in his support of the plan, the seeds of division have already been sowed.  "Some Premier League club are very much against the proposal," a West Ham source was quoted as saying by the BBC. "The big six are using COVID for a power grab. If this goes through, over time they will just use more and more for themselves." But another Premier League club source told the Guardian that he was confident about the prospect of the plan, adding: "Beggars can't be choosers. It is about saving the game from oblivion." Borussia Dortmund's Youssoufa Moukoko, who turns 16 on November 20, could make Champions League history next month by becoming the competition's youngest player ever. Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc told German daily Bild "we will enter him on the B list" for the group stages of the Champions League, with Dortmund having drawn Zenit Saint Petersburg, Brugge and Lazio in Group F. The 15-year-old Moukoko, already a prolific scorer in German youth football, is not on the club's 'A' list of players registered for the Champions League competition. However, he will be on their 'B' list, which according to UEFA regulations means a 16-year-old can play, provided he has been at the club for at least two years. Moukoko joined Dortmund in 2016. He will turn 16 four days before Dortmund host Brugge in the group stages on November 24, when he could become the youngest player in Champions League history.The record is currently held by Nigeria's Celestine Babayaro, now 42, who was 16 years, 86 days old when he played for Anderlecht against Steaua Bucharest in 1994.He famously lasted just 34 minutes before being sent off, but went on to spend eight years at Chelsea.In 2018/19, Moukoko scored 50 goals in 28 matches for Dortmund's Under-17 side against much older opponents. Last season, aged 14, he moved up to the U19 squad and scored 38 goals in 28 matches.Last month, the 15-year-old scored a hat-trick in his first Under-19 game and has already trained with Dortmund's senior squad.He also made his debut in September for the German U20 national team.However, Sebastian Kehl, head of Dortmund's player department, told SID that the club is keen to dampen the hype around their "wunderkind."Making his professional debut would be "a big step and he is only 15 years old. We must give him the necessary peace and time" to develop, Kehl added.Dortmund currently have two 17-year-olds in their first team in Giovanni Reyna and England junior international Jude Bellingham.Borussia Dortmund's Youssoufa Moukoko, who turns 16 on November 20, could make Champions League history next month by becoming the competition's youngest player ever. Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc told German daily Bild "we will enter him on the B list" for the group stages of the Champions League, with Dortmund having drawn Zenit Saint Petersburg, Brugge and Lazio in Group F. The 15-year-old Moukoko, already a prolific scorer in German youth football, is not on the club's 'A' list of players registered for the Champions League competition. However, he will be on their 'B' list, which according to UEFA regulations means a 16-year-old can play, provided he has been at the club for at least two years.

Let the better one win!" Pulev later posted in his profile on the social media Facebook.He did not mention if the bout will be behind closed doors due to Covid-19 restrictions as earlier expected, prompting Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn to say he was willing to move the fight to the Middle East if an audience is allowed there.Joshua beat Andy Ruiz to regain the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles in Saudi Arabia in December.He is, however, due to put them up for grabs in a mandatory fight with the Bulgarian.Pulev has been waiting for a chance to face Joshua for almost three years now after a shoulder injury forced him out of a world title bout in October 2017.The fight should be Joshua's last before taking on WBC champion Tyson Fury in a lucrative all-British unification bout next year.Fury is set to defend his belt before Christmas before what UK media report will be a springtime clash at Wembley, assuming coronavirus crowd restrictions have been lifted by then.The Daily Mail reports that Fury's rematch with Deontay Wilder has been called off due to the "imminent expiration" of the American's contractual right to the third match between the pair, paving the way for the Gypsy King's bout with Joshua.Kubrat Pulev confirmed on Monday that he will face the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua in a title bout in London on December 12.Britain's Joshua was originally scheduled to fight Pulev on June 20, with a second date in July also mooted amid the coronavirus pandemic."It's official: Pulev vs. Joshua on December 12 in London," Pulev posted on his official webpage on Monday, adding that the date and place were final and the contract had been signed."There is no way back, no postponement, no rescheduling!...

I don't think today about the 20th and equal Roger on this great number, today is just a Roland Garros victory and that means everything to me," the world number two said."This love story I have with this city and this court is unforgettable."The final, expected by many to be another great clash in one of the sport's greatest rivalries, turned out to be a bit of a surprise as Nadal dominated throughout in a one-sided match with a flawless performance to score his 100th match win in Paris. He raised his game to an unbelievable level from the start, granting his opponent no error space as he answered every ball deep and heavy. Nadal only committed six unforced errors in the opening two sets altogether and maintained his form to produce a high-quality third set before sealing his victory against Djokovic. "Today you showed why you are the king of clay. Today was a tough match, I was outplayed by a better player today," said Djokovic after losing his third Roland Garros final to Nadal and failing to shrink the gap with Federer and the Spaniard for the most major wins. "He did surprise me with the way he was playing, the quality of tennis he was producing, the level. He's phenomenal. He played a perfect match, especially in the first two sets."Heading into the tournament, many were doubtful about Nadal's continuing dominance amid unfavorable weather conditions as well as his lack of usual preparation on clay courts due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Nadal, this was the toughest test he had ever faced at Roland Garros. But he came through those challenges with potentially his highest level of play in the final to win the tournament.Unforced errors in the more competitive third set gave Djokovic a glimpse of hope that he could turn the match around. However, the king of clay held on, breaking again in the 11th game and bagging the victory. Nadal and Federer, with their haul of 20 majors, now stand three clear of Djokovic, the last active player to beat the Spaniard at Roland Garros.Federer, who has been recovering from knee surgery and just confirmed his participation in the 2021 Australian Open, congratulated his friend."I have always had the utmost respect for my friend Rafa as a person and a champion," he tweeted. "As my greatest rival over many years, I believe we have pushed each other to become better players.""Therefore it is a true honor for me to congratulate him on his 20th Grand Slam victory.

The ultimate joy.This season, for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, had it all. And it ended in the only fashion that they deemed would be acceptable, with them back atop the basketball world.For the first time since Kobe Bryant's fifth and final title a decade ago, the Lakers are NBA champions. James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Lakers beat the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday night to win the NBA Finals in six games.And it was only fitting that James took the top honors as he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player honors for a fourth time."It means a lot to represent this franchise," James said, recalling what he told team owner Jeanie Buss when he arrived in Los Angeles in 2018: "I wanted to put this franchise back where it belongs. For me to be a part of such a historical franchise is an unbelievable feeling."Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who had to deal with the anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise â and against the Heat franchise that showed him how to become a champion.Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler â the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention. Rajon Rondo scored 19 points for the Lakers.With that, the league's bubble chapter, put together after a four-and-a-half-month suspension of play that started on March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic, is over. So, too, is a season that saw political sparring between the league and China, the death on January 1 of commissioner emeritus David Stern â the man who did so much to make the league what it is â and then the shock on January 26 that came with the news that Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other had died in a helicopter crash.The Lakers said they were playing the rest of the season in his memory.They delivered what Bryant did five times for L.A. â a ring, and the clincher was emphatic.Game 6 was over by halftime, the Lakers taking a 64-36 lead into the break. The Heat never led and couldn't shoot from anywhere: 35 percent from 2-point range in the half, 33 percent from 3-point range and even an uncharacteristic 42 percent from the line, not like any of it really mattered. The Lakers were getting everything they wanted and then some, outscoring Miami 36-16 in the second quarter and doing all that with James making just one shot in the period.Rajon Rondo, now a two-time champion and the first to win rings as a player in both Boston and Los Angeles â the franchises now tied with 17 titles apiece â was 6 for 6 in the half, the first time he has done that since November 2007. The Lakers' lead was 46-32 with 5:00 left in the half, and they outscored Miami 18-4 from there until intermission.Ball game. The 28-point halftime lead was the second-biggest in NBA Finals history, topped only by the Celtics leading the Lakers 79-49 on May 27, 1985.True to form, the Heat â a No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference that finished with a losing record last season, a team that embraced the challenge of the bubble like none other â did not stop playing, not even when the deficit got to 36 in the third quarter.A 23-8 run by Miami got the Heat to 90-69 with 8:37 left. But the outcome was never in doubt, and before long confetti was blasted into the air as the Lakers' celebration formally and officially began.The ultimate anguish. The ultimate joy.This season, for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, had it all. And it ended in the only fashion that they deemed would be acceptable, with them back atop the basketball world.For the first time since Kobe Bryant's fifth and final title a decade ago, the Lakers are NBA champions. James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Lakers beat the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday night to win the NBA Finals in six games.And it was only fitting that James took the top honors as he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player honors for a fourth time."It means a lot to represent this franchise," James said, recalling what he told team owner Jeanie Buss when he arrived in Los Angeles in 2018: "I wanted to put this franchise back where it belongs. For me to be a part of such a historical franchise is an unbelievable feeling."Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who had to deal with the anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise â and against the Heat franchise that showed him how to become a champion.Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler â the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention.

"France are a great team. They have great players. It's not always possible to create opportunities."Pepe headed home what he thought was a 74th-minute opener when he got on the end of Bruno Fernandes' free-kick but was flagged offside.Ronaldo, chasing his 102nd international goal, was denied by a flying save from Hugo Lloris in added time.Mbappe fluffed France's best when Rui Patricio anticipated his gentle chip when one-on-one with the Portuguese stopper.Both sides are now on seven points, four ahead of Croatia, whose 2-1 home win over Sweden earlier on Sunday was the group's more entertaining match, with a calamitous late lapse from Pontus Jansson allowing the 2018 World Cup finalists to snatch the points in a soaking Zagreb.Defender Jansson dawdled under a high ball into the penalty area with six minutes remaining and allowed Ivan Perisic to nip in behind. The Inter Milan winger then squared the ball for Andrej Kramaric to tap in from close range.Sweden are stuck on no points after losing all three of their matches.Elsewhere, Italy stretched their unbeaten streak to 18 matches and held onto top spot in League A, Group 1 with a stalemate in Gdansk.New Juventus signing Federico Chiesa missed the chance to win the match for the dominant Azzurri from close range in the 11th minute.Roberto Mancini's side are one point ahead of the Netherlands, who also drew 0-0 with Bosnia and Herzegovina, ahead of their meeting in Bergamo on Wednesday.England manager Gareth Southgate said his side showed what they were made of after coming from behind to beat Belgium 2-1 and move top of League A, Group 2 earlier on Sunday.The Three Lions are on seven points, one ahead of the world's top-ranked side after Marcus Rashford's spot-kick and Mason Mount's deflected winner 25 minutes from time cancelled out Romelu Lukaku's early penalty."We are not going to face a more difficult game defensively," said Southgate. "That is the beauty of the Nations League, you get games against this level of opponent."It's a great experience for them and to go and win it, (it) should give them a sense of what might be possible in the next few years."Denmark are three points behind England in third after their simple 3-0 win over bottom side Iceland.In League B, Erling Braut Haaland showed what the rescheduled Euro 2020 will be missing after he slammed home a hat-trick to help Norway to a 4-0 thrashing of Romania.Haaland struck in the 13th, 64th and 74th minutes as Norway moved level on six points with group leaders Austria, 1-0 winners at Northern Ireland.Norway were knocked out of the Euros playoffs by Serbia on Thursday.Portugal and Italy kept hold of first place in their UEFA Nations League groups on Sunday with goalless draws against France and Poland respectively on a night of little drama, while England saw off Belgium to take the initiative in their pool.There was little to talk about at the Stade de France as a star-studded line-up of players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann failed to muster much of a spectacle in the League A, Group 3 match.One-thousand fans gathered in the cavernous stadium just outside Paris to watch France host the reigning European champions, but were treated to just four shots on target as two rugged defenses cancelled out each team's attacks."We didn't score a goal, but we weren't here to score goals," said Portugal coach Fernando Santos.

We've played so many times, one day one wins, another day the other wins."Djokovic had won five Grand Slam finals in a row since being beaten by Stan Wawrinka at the 2016 Australian Open, but Nadal was not upset on his turf despite a new stadium design, the roof and the lack of spectators amid the COVID-19 crisis.The 34-year-old Nadal would not think of matching Federer's mark."To win here means everything.

Rally driver Safina Khan has battled critics to ensure women are represented and leads by example.Safina Khan was introduced to Motorsport as a young girl. She did not need to look far for inspiration."It's quite interesting Simon, I actually got into it because of my dad. My father was actually one of the people who was the top most mechanic in the Nissan rally team that time which used to come from Japan to Kenya just to participate in our Safari Rally. so I used to follow him around, he used to take me around on his servicing, when the cars used to come, when they used to go testing, so that is I think when the first bug bit me," says Safina Khan, rally driver.Safina was totally hooked to the "dangerous sport" when she saw an all female crew take part in the iconic Safari Rally."The person who actually sealed the deal for me was when I saw Michelle Mouton and Fabrizia Pons participating in the Safari Rally and I said to myself hey if these ladies can take part in such a powerful machine they were driving an Audi, and a Lancia, Why can't I be part of this one day and the thing which helped me was the fact that I was interested in mechanics so I used to help my dad building the engines doing the servicing and stuff like that at a very young age so I said to myself all I have to do is just follow my passion and that is what I did."Sadly, her chosen career in rallying exposed Safina to ridicule and criticism in a male-dominated sport."But it was a very hard journey I had a lot of naysayers they turned round and said you are going to go and die these cars are going to roll, you will be nowhere to be seen and a woman your place is in the kitchen what are you doing out there that is a man's sport and I said to them no you know what, what the man can do we can do because in the long run we are all humans," Safina submits.Determined to beat all odds and gender discrimination, Safina literary forced her way into the sport."I actually stowed away in one of an auto-cross car that my dad was participating in, in Solai track in Nakuru, I hid the organizers did not see me and when they discovered I was already in the car and we are already on the circuit well its another thing that they had to stop the race just to tell my dad to get me out of the car but then like I said that time I was bitten. From that event I basically continued with school because my father put his foot down and said education first so i had to get back into school and do what I had to do."Upon finishing, school a call came through that changed her life."Then one day I got a call out of the blues from a lady called Michelle, she is also a Kenyan and she asked me whether I was interested in rallying. An our first car was actually a Subaru GC8 we formed a team called ladies luck rally team and we were both Kenyans participating in the circuit in  a subaru Imprezza we did our first rally .... in 1998 that's when we did our first Safari it was very hard. In those day's it was actually a 3,000km event.Since then, Safina has gone on to win 5 coupe de dames trophies in the Safari rally, an Award given for the highest finishing all female crew.She was also crowned as the Kenya Autocross champion in 2018. But her golden moment came when she heard the Kenyan anthem played in Uganda after a stunning performance from her team ladies luck."It was a very important race for us, we started off in the 30's and we actually finished in the top 5 among the top end cars, just me and my driver Michelle, we were the top placed Kenyans. you can imagine the feeling we had when we had our flag across our bonnet, the bonnet of our car, we were taken to the ramp and they played for us our national anthem we actually cried we had tears in our eyes. you know you feel so proud to be Kenyan and to be bringing home the trophies in an alien country or in another country.

For a lot of fighters, one solid hit in the form of a loss is enough to derail them. Ronda Rousey never recovered from Holly Holm; Chris Weidman, who was 13-0 in 2015, has gone a grim 5-2 since his loss to Luke Rockhold; Jose Aldo had his soul taken by a Conor McGregor 13-second KO following 10 years undefeated.In the UFC's current bantamweight division, Cory Sandhagen was one of the top prospects. He entered the UFC with a 7-1 record as a lightweight, but quickly went down to bantam and found himself on a five fight win streak over top guys in his weight class such as John Lineker and Raphael Assuncao. This put him in a championship eliminator against Aljamain Sterling at UFC 250 on June 6 this year.Sandhagen was tapped out in under 90 seconds. It seemed he hadn't planned at all for the smaller cage at the UFC APEX Facility and found himself immediately swallowed up by Sterling who grappled, took his back and then locked in a rear naked choke from a standing position, almost as if he were a human rucksack.He already has a loss on his record, but a unanimous decision is very different to this, the kind of fast, definitive and borderline embarrassing loss that can ruin a fighter, particularly when they are on such a commanding hot streak.His next fight, which took place today at UFC Fight Island 5 against Marlon Moraes, would show if this were a blip or a sign Sandhagen had already peaked. Having lost to then-champion Henry Cejudo at UFC 239 on June 8, 2019, Moraes knew he needed a solid win to get another crack at the belt. He got his win against the aforementioned Aldo at UFC 245 at the end of that year; sadly, that feat doesn't mean much anymore and it looked as if he had spent five rounds sparring with a human punch bag instead of actually fighting.It made sense to match him with Sandhagen and find out who is next in line once #1 Sterling finally faces new champion Petr Yan.Sandhagen, significantly taller and with a longer reach than his Brazilian opponent, began Round 1 by intentionally keeping a distance. Any time Moraes attempted a range-finding jab or one of his trademark football volley-esque leg kicks, he shimmied back. When Sandhagen did engage, it was to maintain this gap; he leaned into his jabs to keep his fist as far away from his body as possible.After two minutes he began engaging in earnest, only, again, due to his height and focus on keeping out of Moraes' danger zone, Sandhagen's leg kicks had him dipping so low, it was as if he were attempting the low sweep from Mortal Kombat. Moraes, not known for his patience, swung for the fences.Sandhagen avoided each and it looked like the round was in the can already, but with two minutes left, it started to look like a high-level ploy. Any time Moraes missed, Sandhagen would close in and start attacking, bringing him close enough for a brawl. Unfortunately, Moraes' reliance on hitting hard rather than hitting fast meant he took more damage than he gave.According to UFCstats.com, Moraes landed 12 significant strikes in the first frame, less than half of Sandhagen's 30. Worse still, Sandhagen's incredible variety meant an almost even spread between the head, body and legs with 11, eight and 11 respectively. Moraes landed two leg kicks and the rest of his offense went to the head.Going into Round 2, Sandhagen knew that his fight plan was working and also that Moraes' wasn't. This confidence was clear as he sprinted to the middle of the Octagon to begin. He peppered Moraes with tap-tap jabs and then followed with harder punches and even a front kick when the Brazilian tried to fight back.With 4:32 remaining in the round, Sandhagen hit a question mark kick that smacked Moraes directly above his right eye. As Moraes recovered, Sandhagen could be heard shouting "his orbital's broke," referring to the orbital bone around the eye that had just been hit and barely 20 seconds later, he hit that bone again with a beautiful spinning heel kick for a TKO win.Cool, calm and clinical. In just over six minutes, Sandhagen turned the Sterling loss from a possible derailment to barely even registering as a blip.In the words of boxing legend Rocky Balboa, "it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." For a lot of fighters, one solid hit in the form of a loss is enough to derail them. Ronda Rousey never recovered from Holly Holm; Chris Weidman, who was 13-0 in 2015, has gone a grim 5-2 since his loss to Luke Rockhold; Jose Aldo had his soul taken by a Conor McGregor 13-second KO following 10 years undefeated.In the UFC's current bantamweight division, Cory Sandhagen was one of the top prospects. He entered the UFC with a 7-1 record as a lightweight, but quickly went down to bantam and found himself on a five fight win streak over top guys in his weight class such as John Lineker and Raphael Assuncao. This put him in a championship eliminator against Aljamain Sterling at UFC 250 on June 6 this year.Sandhagen was tapped out in under 90 seconds. It seemed he hadn't planned at all for the smaller cage at the UFC APEX Facility and found himself immediately swallowed up by Sterling who grappled, took his back and then locked in a rear naked choke from a standing position, almost as if he were a human rucksack.He already has a loss on his record, but a unanimous decision is very different to this, the kind of fast, definitive and borderline embarrassing loss that can ruin a fighter, particularly when they are on such a commanding hot streak.His next fight, which took place today at UFC Fight Island 5 against Marlon Moraes, would show if this were a blip or a sign Sandhagen had already peaked. Having lost to then-champion Henry Cejudo at UFC 239 on June 8, 2019, Moraes knew he needed a solid win to get another crack at the belt. He got his win against the aforementioned Aldo at UFC 245 at the end of that year; sadly, that feat doesn't mean much anymore and it looked as if he had spent five rounds sparring with a human punch bag instead of actually fighting.It made sense to match him with Sandhagen and find out who is next in line once #1 Sterling finally faces new champion Petr Yan.Sandhagen, significantly taller and with a longer reach than his Brazilian opponent, began Round 1 by intentionally keeping a distance. Any time Moraes attempted a range-finding jab or one of his trademark football volley-esque leg kicks, he shimmied back. When Sandhagen did engage, it was to maintain this gap; he leaned into his jabs to keep his fist as far away from his body as possible.After two minutes he began engaging in earnest, only, again, due to his height and focus on keeping out of Moraes' danger zone, Sandhagen's leg kicks had him dipping so low, it was as if he were attempting the low sweep from Mortal Kombat. Moraes, not known for his patience, swung for the fences.Sandhagen avoided each and it looked like the round was in the can already, but with two minutes left, it started to look like a high-level ploy. Any time Moraes missed, Sandhagen would close in and start attacking, bringing him close enough for a brawl. Unfortunately, Moraes' reliance on hitting hard rather than hitting fast meant he took more damage than he gave.According to UFCstats.com, Moraes landed 12 significant strikes in the first frame, less than half of Sandhagen's 30. Worse still, Sandhagen's incredible variety meant an almost even spread between the head, body and legs with 11, eight and 11 respectively. Moraes landed two leg kicks and the rest of his offense went to the head.Going into Round 2, Sandhagen knew that his fight plan was working and also that Moraes' wasn't. This confidence was clear as he sprinted to the middle of the Octagon to begin. He peppered Moraes with tap-tap jabs and then followed with harder punches and even a front kick when the Brazilian tried to fight back.With 4:32 remaining in the round, Sandhagen hit a question mark kick that smacked Moraes directly above his right eye.

In just over six minutes, Sandhagen turned the Sterling loss from a possible derailment to barely even registering as a blip.When Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski missed out on the chance to win his first Ballon d'Or after the prestigious award was cancelled for the first time since 1956 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland was shocked.As one of the most recognizable Polish stars in the world, Lewandowski was favorite to receive the honor after netting incredible 55 goals in 47 games and helping Bayern win the UEFA Champions League, Super Cup, Bundesliga and German Cup last season. However, the organizers' controversial decision to write off the campaign's achievement broke the 32-year-old and his compatriots' heart."We won everything we could with Bayern. I was the top scorer in all competitions I featured in and I think a player who achieves this would win the Ballon d'Or," a clearly frustrated Lewandowski told Polish reporters back in August.Like many others in the footballing world, he thought he has been robbed of the 2020 Ballon d'Or.Fortunately, nobody could rob Iga Swiatek of the tennis world's biggest trophy. The 19-year-old Polish girl, who arrived in Paris ranked 54 in the world, defied the odds to win the French Open after overwhelming Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin in the final on Saturday.As the youngest women's French Open winner since 1992, Swiatek became the first Pole to win a Grand Slam singles title, eclipsing the run of Polish legend Jadwiga Jedrzejowska, who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939.Lewandowski was among the first to offer congratulations as the whole Poland erupted into celebration. "What an amazing success, what a great story! Good job, Iga Swiatek," he beamed on Twitter.The exhilaration was shared by tennis star Agnieszka Radwanska, who is the first Polish player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam singles final in 2012, when he stormed into the Wimbledon Championships final and lost to Serena Williams."Congratulations, Iga Swiatek! A fabulous showing for tennis," Radwanska posted on Instagram.Poland's President Andrzej Duda also expressed his public endorsement. "Great thanks and congratulations for Iga Swiatek! A historic day for Poland, for Polish sport and for Polish tennis. Bravo!" he tweeted.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also followed suit, tweeting "Huge congratulations to Iga Swiatek, who has achieved today the success of her life and â I am convinced â just the first success in the Grand Slam. Amazing story written by this young girl on the Roland Garros courts! Paris is Polish today!"Seven-time Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander was equally optimistic about the teenager's bright future. "Iga looked so relieved but also calm, she is going to win so many more â you can see that in her demeanor throughout the whole finals," he said via Eurosport.He was echoed by former British No.1 Tim Henman, who told the Guardian: "Her mentality is so strong when she is so young. Those three elements, the physical, technical and mental are all so important and you see her athletic ability, too.""When you reflect on her mentality, how calm she's been, her sense of belonging she's had out on court, it's been incredible all the way through. When you add it all up â 28 games she lost to win a grand slam in seven matches â it's just been a complete domination. She's such a deserving champion."Facing a deluge of congratulatory messages, Swiatek exuded confidence and calm. "I know it's going to be crazy. I think I'm going to get used to that, it's not going to be a problem for me," the Warsaw native said in his post-game interview."I didn't have problem with, like, getting attention, with people surrounding me. I think it's going to be okay for me. I really appreciate all the support I got during whole two weeks. I know that the whole country was behind me and they all believed in me. I'm going to be happy and proud," she noted.Seven of the past eight grand slam titles have been won by players under the age of 23, and Swiatek knows that the new generation of tennis players need to be more ruthless and consistent if they want to achieve dominance in this sport."I know my game isn't developed perfectly," she observed. "Also I think the biggest change for me is going to be to be consistent. I think this is what women's tennis is struggling with.""That's why we have so many new Grand Slam winners because we are not as consistent as Rafa, Roger, and Novak. That's why my goal is going to be to be consistent. It's going to be really hard to achieve that," she added.Swiatek's path to the French Open titleFirst round: beat Marketa Vondrousova  6-1, 6-2Second round: beat Hsieh Su-Wei 6-1, 6-4Third round: beat Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-2Fourth round: beat Simona Halep 6-1, 6-2Quarterfinal: beat Martina Trevisan 6-3, 6-1Semifinal: beat Nadia Podoroska 6-2, 6-1Final: beat Sofia Kenin 6-4, 6-1When Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski missed out on the chance to win his first Ballon d'Or after the prestigious award was cancelled for the first time since 1956 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland was shocked.As one of the most recognizable Polish stars in the world, Lewandowski was favorite to receive the honor after netting incredible 55 goals in 47 games and helping Bayern win the UEFA Champions League, Super Cup, Bundesliga and German Cup last season.

His reaggravated heel injury somehow became an Archilles Heel for both the team and himself, unable to lift the trophy with a 4-1 in the series on Friday, but instead, losing to the Heat 108-111.Davis looked painful on the floor, clutching his lower right ankle, and stayed on the bench for the rest of the quarter. His heel problem was already obvious in Game 3, the first game the Lakers lost in the series, in which Davis had 15 points and five rebounds, his worst in this Finals. The Lakers still lead the series 3-2. LeBron James was disappointed for not winning the title on Friday, saying they have to "be better at Game 6 and close the series."The Lakers had a three-point lead midway through the final quarter of Game 5 and let it get away. They led by one after a basket by Davis with 21.8 seconds left and were one stop from winning the title; Davis ended up fouling Butler, a call the Lakers said shouldn't have been made. The NBA disagreed Saturday, saying Butler was fouled on the play."We're motivated to win Game 6 and they are motivated to win Game 6," Davis said.

It is so often right now that it is crazy," said Swiatek, who captured her first tour title in the process."I don't know what's going on. It's overwhelming for me, it's crazy."Two years ago I won a junior Grand Slam (at Wimbledon) and now I'm here. It feels like such a short time," she said.Swiatek is the youngest women's French Open winner since Monica Seles lifted the trophy as an 18-year-old in 1992. She is the first teenage champion since Iva Majoli in 1997."It's crazy for me because I watched Rafael Nadal lift the trophy every year and now I'm in the same place," added Swiatek, the first woman to secure the title without losing a set since Justine Henin in 2007.Swiatek also became just the second unseeded women's Roland Garros champion in the Open era, joining Jelena Ostapenko who claimed a shock title three years ago.  She eclipsed the run of compatriot Jadwiga Jedrzejowska â the most outstanding Polish player of the interwar period â who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939. Swiatek was only the second Polish woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open era after Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon in 2012. She had never previously been beyond the last 16.Australian Open champion Kenin, 21, fell short in her attempt to become the first woman to capture two Slams in the same year since Angelique Kerber in 2016."I just want to congratulate Iga on a great tournament and a great match.

The referees only remove their masks to announce penalties. The NFL fined five coaches $100,000 each -- and their teams $250,000 -- for failing to wear masks properly in the early weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the New York Jets sent their team and coaches home on Friday as a precaution after a player received a presumed positive COVID-19 test result. The Jets, who are scheduled to host the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, will work virtually for the rest of the day and the player will be re-tested. The NFL, which is entering the fifth week of its 2020 schedule, has already pushed back a pair of games originally set for Sunday after a number of positive COVID-19 tests among players and personnel on multiple teams. As a result, the New England Patriots' home game versus the Denver Broncos has been pushed back to Monday, while the Tennessee Titans game against the visiting Buffalo Bills is scheduled for Tuesday. (With input from Reuters)Any coach who approaches a referee without wearing a proper face covering now can be slapped with a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. It is a response to complaints from the NFL Referees Association about coaches and other sideline personnel pulling down their masks to yell at officials from close range. "We have seen multiple occasions where head coaches have removed their masks to communicate with game officials during games," Perry Fewell, the NFL's senior vice president of officiating administration, wrote in the memo. "Doing so creates unnecessary, increased risk for the game official, the head coach, and others, and is inconsistent with the requirement that face coverings be worn at all times. ..."The league's COVID-19 protocols require everyone on the sideline to wear a face covering except for players who are actively involved in the game.

opening 2022 World Cup qualifier on Friday.Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos also got on the scoresheet while star forward Neymar set up two goals in a totally one-sided encounter that sent Brazil top of the South American qualifying table.In a Corinthians Arena deserted due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bolivia showed almost no ambition as Brazil dominated throughout, with PSG's Neymar starting after overcoming a back problem.Inside the first minute, winger Everton volleyed wide from inside the six-yard box and three minutes later his cross was headed off-target by Marquinhos from a similar position.Bolivia couldn't get out of their half, or on the ball, as Coutinho and Everton created a slew of chances down Brazil's left.The pressure told on 16 minutes as Marquinhos headed home from an identical position to his earlier chance as full-back Danilo swung over a cross from the right following a short corner.Even a first half downpour couldn't dampen Brazil's thrust as Coutinho forced a diving one-handed save from goalkeeper Carlos Lampe with a deflected shot.At times it looked like a handball game with Brazil camped on the edge of Bolivia's box, and the visitors keeping 10 men behind the ball at all times.But on the half hour, left-back Renan Lodi got in behind the defense and his cross from the left was turned home from barely a yard out by Firmino.Lampe made a fine one-handed save from a Casemiro free-kick and then smothered a close range finish by Neymar.By the end of the first half, Bolivia had had less than 20 percent possession and their only shot at goal was a free-kick from 40 yards by Fernando Salidas that didn't even beat the wall.If there were still any doubts Brazil would stroll to victory, they were dispelled three minutes into the second period when a sublime pass from Neymar presented Firmino with a tap-in from six yards.On 65 minutes, a cross from Coutinho flew into the net off the unlucky Jose Carrasco's chest.Coutinho then got on the scoresheet heading home a cross from Neymar from six yards.Neymar's attempts to join retired great Ronaldo as Brazil's second highest scorer of all time were frustrated by an offside flag and an injury time save by Lampe.In the night's other match, Atalanta pair Duvan Zapata and Luis Muriel fired Colombia to a 3-0 win over Venezuela.Zapata slid in a

was originally scheduled for early March, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organizers to postpone it to October. However, as several countries still raised concerns over the deadly virus, the tournament was again delayed until November 18.Qatar proved its ability to provide a safe environment for elite competition after the country managed to host the West Zone games for the AFC Champions League without a hitch. Earlier this month, Iranian giants Persepolis were crowned Western champions in Doha after overwhelming Saudi powerhouse Al Nassr 5-3 on penalties. Persepolis will take on the Eastern representative in a single-leg final, which is set to be played on December 19. According to AFC, the venue for the final will be confirmed in due course."We are extremely grateful for the outstanding support of the QFA and are pleased that we can now build on the success of the AFC Champions League (West) while looking forward to the remaining exciting matches in Asia's premier club competition," said Dato' Windsor John, the AFC General Secretary."Everything from the arrival of the teams, the efficient immigration process, the rigorous health screenings, hotels with biosecurity measures, to the state-of-the-art training facilities and stadiums were of the highest possible standard as the AFC insisted that the welfare and well-being of the players, officials and match officials was our top priority," he added.Among four teams from the Chinese Super League, only Beijing Guoan had a single outing, pulling off a 1-0 win over Chiangrai United in Thailand back in February.

Sunday will be their 56th clash."This is the house of Rafa," said Djokovic. "I will have the motivation to win, I beat him here in 2015 but this will be the biggest challenge â playing Nadal on clay."Djokovic hailed Tsitsipas, who was appearing in the semi-final of a Slam for only the second time."Stefanos is a big player but after four hours he was tired. He gave me a lot of trouble. I looked calm on the surface but it was a different story inside," added Djokovic who will be in his 27th Slam final.Djokovic took a 5-1 career lead over Tsitsipas into the semi-final and showing no signs of the neck and shoulder injury which blighted his performance against Pablo Carreno Busta in the last eight, he secured the only break of the opener in the second game.Crucially, he saved all five break points he faced.That became seven from seven early in the second set and he made Tsitsipas pay, breaking for a 3-2 edge and backing it up with another for 5-2.The 22-year-old Greek, appearing in his first French Open semi-final, just couldn't make Djokovic crack.An eighth break point came and went in the second game of the third set with Djokovic breaking for 5-4.Having saved two more break points, Djokovic was unable to convert a match point in the 10th game, picked up a time violation and, unsettled by the call as well as disturbances in the crowd, was broken at the 11th time of asking.From the brink of a quick exit, Tsitsipas stayed alive, taking the third set 7-5.Djokovic squandered 10 break points in the fourth set as Tsitsipas, who had also been two sets down in his opening match against Jaume Munar, levelled the match.However, in a final twist and as the clock ticked closer to the four-hour mark, Tsitsipas faded away in the decider, dropping serve twice to hand Djokovic a 4-1 lead.He saved another match point but was powerless on the third as Djokovic fired a clean winner.For 34-year-old Nadal, his win over Schwartzman was his 99th at Roland Garros.He is into his 28th final at the majors and has not dropped a set in the tournament this year."It's always incredible to play here and this is a very special moment," said Nadal after a 10th win in 11 matches against Schwartzman who had shocked him in Rome last month."I played a couple of bad points in the third set but Diego is a very tough player.

Is not easy playing them five sets because you have to play your best tennis maybe for three, four hours, five hours. Physically it's very hard," he admitted.(With input from agencies)Novak Djokovic set up a blockbuster French Open title showdown with Rafael Nadal on Friday after a dramatic five-set semi-final victory over Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas.World number one Djokovic, the 2016 champion at Roland Garros, reached his fifth final in Paris, defeating fifth seed Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1 in a roller-coaster of a contest where he had held a match point in the third set.Nadal, the 12-time champion, defeated Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0) to make a 13th final at the tournament.On Sunday, Djokovic can win an 18th major and become the first man in half a century to win all four Slams twice.Nadal, the world number two, can equal Roger Federer's all-time record of 20 Grand Slam title wins.Djokovic is one of only two men to have defeated Nadal at Roland Garros in 15 years. Sunday will be their 56th clash."This is the house of Rafa," said Djokovic. "I will have the motivation to win, I beat him here in 2015 but this will be the biggest challenge â playing Nadal on clay."Djokovic hailed Tsitsipas, who was appearing in the semi-final of a Slam for only the second time."Stefanos is a big player but after four hours he was tired. He gave me a lot of trouble. I looked calm on the surface but it was a different story inside," added Djokovic who will be in his 27th Slam final.Djokovic took a 5-1 career lead over Tsitsipas into the semi-final and showing no signs of the neck and shoulder injury which blighted his performance against Pablo Carreno Busta in the last eight, he secured the only break of the opener in the second game.Crucially, he saved all five break points he faced.That became seven from seven early in the second set and he made Tsitsipas pay, breaking for a 3-2 edge and backing it up with another for 5-2.The 22-year-old Greek, appearing in his first French Open semi-final, just couldn't make Djokovic crack.An eighth break point came and went in the second game of the third set with Djokovic breaking for 5-4.Having saved two more break points, Djokovic was unable to convert a match point in the 10th game, picked up a time violation and, unsettled by the call as well as disturbances in the crowd, was broken at the 11th time of asking.From the brink of a quick exit, Tsitsipas stayed alive, taking the third set 7-5.Djokovic squandered 10 break points in the fourth set as Tsitsipas, who had also been two sets down in his opening match against Jaume Munar, levelled the match.However, in a final twist and as the clock ticked closer to the four-hour mark, Tsitsipas faded away in the decider, dropping serve twice to hand Djokovic a 4-1 lead.He saved another match point but was powerless on the third as Djokovic fired a clean winner.For 34-year-old Nadal, his win over Schwartzman was his 99th at Roland Garros.He is into his 28th final at the majors and has not dropped a set in the tournament this year."It's always incredible to play here and this is a very special moment," said Nadal after a 10th win in 11 matches against Schwartzman who had shocked him in Rome last month."I played a couple of bad points in the third set but Diego is a very tough player. He probably makes more breaks on the tour than others.""It's different playing against Djokovic, Federer, Rafa, these guys. Is not easy playing them five sets because you have to play your best tennis maybe for three, four hours, five hours.

It was Schwartzman's first win against Nadal in 10 meetings.However, this time round, the Spaniard held his own against a determined Schwartzman who did his best to push him, even forcing the third set into a tie-break.Nadal, who is yet to drop a set at this year's tournament, is now into his 13th French Open final. He has never lost in the semi-final or final of the tournament.Nadal will face either Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday's final as he bids for a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title.(With input from agencies)Spain's Rafael Nadal progressed to the French Open final following a comfortable win over Argentine Diego Schwartzman on Friday.Nadal, a 12-time champion at Roland Garros, won 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 on Court Philippe Chatrier.Despite Nadal's dominance on clay, the build-up to the match had been made interesting after Schwartzman's stunning straight sets win over Nadal last month at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.

I always knew that if I would be in a Grand Slam final, it would be at the French Open," Swiatek said on court after becoming the first Polish woman to reach the Roland Garros final in 81 years and the first at any major since Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon eight years ago.She managed to hit through the court well, both off the forehand and backhand, and painted the red clay with winners, amassing 23 during another typical performance at a tournament in which she also snapped top seed Simona Halep's 17-match winning run.Unable to put up much resistance, Podoroska decided to show more aggression and started coming forward to cut down the time for Swiatek to hit her big shots.Swiatek, who also plays in a doubles semi-final on Friday, kept up the tempo and raced to a 4-0 lead before nervous errors allowed Podoroska to avoid a second-set bagel with a break of serve.The Pole, who has lost only 23 games in six matches, broke back immediately, however, and ended Podoroska's ordeal on the first match point with an unreturned serve. Fourth seed Kenin, who beat Spain's Garbine Muguruza to win the Australian Open in February, proved too solid for the 30-year-old Kvitova who had not lost a set en route to her first French Open semi-final since 2012.A mixture of crafty shot placement, superb defense and some scorching backhand winners, combined with too many Kvitova mistakes, put Kenin in command and her only wobble came when she served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but was broken.When she got a second chance to serve it out at 6-5, however, the American could not be denied as Kvitova fired a forehand wide on match point â a shot that rather summed up the Czech's performance."I had tough matches these past two weeks.

He measures 170cm (5ft 7in) and is the same height as Ken Rosewall, who won the last of his eight Grand Slam titles in 1972. Apart from the great Australian, no one of that height or less, has won one of the tennis season's four major tournaments â the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open â since 1968, when the sport allowed professionals to enter.Schwartzman is thriving in a world of giants â he is 41cm (1ft 3in) shorter than the tallest Top 50 player, Reilly Opelka, who is 211cm (6ft 11in) â but why is height such a big thing in tennis?  Who is Diego Schwartzman?Named after legendary soccer player Diego Maradona â another sporting superstar from Argentina â Schwartzman always knew he wasnât going to be the traditional height for a tennis player. His childhood nickname is El Peque â a Spanish slang term that roughly translates as "shorty" in English."I have worse problems than being 10 centimeters shorter than everybody else," Schwartzman has said in the past. "When I walk onto a tennis court, I don't think about how tall I am or how much bigger my opponent is. I know there is a difference, but so what?"He has won three ATP singles titles and reached a career-high singles ranking of 11 in June 2018. Before reaching the last four in Paris, his best Grand Slam result was getting to the quarter-finals of the US Open in 2017. He recently beat semi-final opponent Nadal in the Italian Open.  Why is height important in tennis?Itâs partly a question of physics. The taller a player is, the heavier they are and therefore the harder they can hit the ball. It generally means longer arms, which generate more power and afford extra reach, rotation and racket head speed. The crucial advantage, however, is on the serve. Hitting the serve from a greater height means the stroke can be hit harder and with a downward trajectory to make the ball bounce higher on the opponentâs side of the court. The extra height also gives taller players a great margin of error because they have more angles to play with from the point at which the ball is struck.  Have professional players got taller?Definitely. In 1968, when professionals were allowed to enter the major tournaments, the average height of a Grand Slam winner was 176cm (5ft 7in). By 2019, that figure had risen steadily to 186.5cm (6ft 1in). Rosewall was the first Grand Slam champion of the Open era and is also its shortest, the same 170cm height as Schwartzman. The tallest are Juan Martin del Potro and Marin Cilic, the 2009 and 2014 US Open champions respectively, who measure 198cm (6ft 6in).It is not just the champions, the situation is repeating itself across the professional tennis tour. At the end of the 1960s, the average height of a Top 20 player was 181.2cm (5ft 9in). By the end of last year it was 187.5cm (6ft 1in) and the figure is still rising. The average height of the current ATP Top 50 is 188.6cm (6ft 2in) and there are more players taller than 190cm â including two, Opelka and John Isner, topping 200cm (6ft 7in) â than ever before."I think players like me, around my height, are going to be extinct," says the recently retired David Ferrer, who measures 180cm (5ft 9in).The women's game is experiencing a similar trend towards taller players, beginning with Martina Navratilova. The Williams sisters, Petra Kvitova, Maria Sharapova â all 180cm (5ft 9in) or taller â have dominated recent decades in the way that Billie Jean King and Chris Evert dominated the 1960s and 1970s. Both were under 168cm (5ft 6in). How has Schwartzman managed to defy the general rule?By playing to his strengths. Shorter players have a lower center of gravity and better movement around the court. What Schwartzman lacks in power and reach, he more than makes up for in agility and guile. Taller players also tend to tire more easily, because of the extra weight they have to carry around the court, and Schwartzman's endurance is a big asset. Five-set matches, as he showed against the higher ranked Dominic Thiem in Paris, don't worry him.He is also known as one of the, if not the, best returners of serve â he breaks serve regularly in his matches. But the question is whether he can hang on to his own service games to win the big matches. So is there an ideal height for a tennis champion?There have been a wide range of heights of tennis champions. But the current "Big Three" of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are tightly bunched between 185cm and 188cm (6ft 1in). They have dominated for more than 15 years between them. They are in the sweet spot of being tall enough to have some kind of height advantage, but not too tall to hamper their speed around the court and their endurance.Many of the next generation of youngsters coming through â Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Matteo Berrettini and Daniil Medvedev among them â are over 190cm (6ft 2in), but work hard to ensure their movement is not compromised. Zverev played field hockey as a junior to improve his movement and changes of direction in a low-gravity sport. That may suggest the height trend is set to continue.But the final word can be left to Schwartzman, who told reporters after a French Open win over 208cm (6ft 8in) Kevin Anderson in 2018: "I read David and Goliath when I was young in the school, and I just try to think of that when I see Kevin or the guys who are two meters."It's a spirit that has been serving him well two years on.Video editor and graphics: Paula HarveyThe author is a former Level 4 tennis coach, who has worked with regional and national players in the UK. When Diego Schwartzman beat Dominic Thiem to reach the semi-finals of the French Open in a five-hour-plus epic, the Argentine came a step closer to tennis history. Not just because the 28-year-old had reached his first Grand Slam semi-final â against Rafael Nadal, the 12-time Roland Garros champion â but because Schwartzman would equal the record for the shortest player in the Open era to win a major were he to lift the trophy in Paris on Sunday.Schwartzman is the shortest player in the ATP Tour's top 50.

It was the first national diving competition since January this year.Three Rio Olympics gold medalists Chen Aisen, Shi Tingmao and Ren Qian along with world champions Wang Han and Zhang Jiaqi were joined with 150 other divers at the national event.Staged at the newly constructed Hebei Olympic Sports Center Swimming and Diving Hall, the event was the first leg of the Chinese diving national team's tryouts for the Tokyo Olympic Games which have been disrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic."To restart our tryouts for the Tokyo Olympics, we wiped out the points divers accumulated in previous tryouts and only had them for reference use," said Zhou Jihong, president of the Chinese Swimming Association."That aside, divers also have to adjust to the difficulties with switching venues and fierce nationwide competitions. For them, it is a lot of pressure."Dubbed as the "dream team" with a total of 40 Olympic gold medals in its pocket, the Chinese diving team has maintained the world's highest caliber throughout the years. Despite the inevitable change of hands from the old generation to the young, the team kept its unbeaten streak at the Olympics as well as World Championships with new stars popping up. And it was still the case at this national event. Quan Hongchan, 13, from Guangdong Province delivered a stunning five-round performance at the women's 10-meter platform to claim the gold. She widened the gap against world champion Zhang Jiaqi after the latter had an average third-round diving and maintained her high-quality diving till the very end to top the podium.In a post-game interview, she said she had not thought of defeating a few world champions on the platform."I just follow my coaches' instructions to take the competition as training. To be bold and just go jumping," said Quan.World champion Zhang Jiaqi finished second with 409.10 points, a point enough to outrank foreign players in international competitions."I feel a little bit disappointed because I feel I have more experience and my techniques are much mature than her but I still lost," said Zhang, who was at the top of the podium four years ago at the same competition."I have accepted my defeat but I will keep competing."The star-dubbed men's 10-meter platform on Tuesday featured two Olympic champions as well as four world champions as the 20-year-old Lian Junjie came from behind to outscore Yang Jian in the last jump to finish top at the podium.It was the first time he jumped 409C action with a difficulty of 4.1 in formal competition as he only started to practice it in January."Starting in January, we've been training with the national team and the efforts seem to have paid off," said Lian."I only tried this action for a few times during tests but never in competitions. I'm quite happy with my performance."The points Lian scored at the men's 10-meter platform, together with the scores Peng Jianfeng clocked at the men's one-meter springboard final, both surpassed the champion scores at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.Zhou Jihong spoke highly of divers' performances at this stop and according to her, the event will be joined with two other national championships in January and May next year to serve as the final reference for the national team's selection for the Tokyo Olympic Games."We should stay confident as everyone works hard, and we remain competitive," said Zhou. "As everything can happen when it comes to competitive sports, the only thing we can do is making sure we are doing our best."(Cover image: Yang Hao of Shaanxi competes during the men's 10-meter platform semifinal at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships in Shijiazhuang, north China's Hebei Province, October 6, 2020. /Xinhua)Young divers stunned the viewers while veterans maintained stable form at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships, which came to a successful close on Wednesday in north China's Hebei Province.

She widened the gap against world champion Zhang Jiaqi after the latter had an average third-round diving and maintained her high-quality diving till the very end to top the podium.In a post-game interview, she said she had not thought of defeating a few world champions on the platform."I just follow my coaches' instructions to take the competition as training. To be bold and just go jumping," said Quan.World champion Zhang Jiaqi finished second with 409.10 points, a point enough to outrank foreign players in international competitions."I feel a little bit disappointed because I feel I have more experience and my techniques are much mature than her but I still lost," said Zhang, who was at the top of the podium four years ago at the same competition."I have accepted my defeat but I will keep competing."The star-dubbed men's 10-meter platform on Tuesday featured two Olympic champions as well as four world champions as the 20-year-old Lian Junjie came from behind to outscore Yang Jian in the last jump to finish top at the podium.It was the first time he jumped 409C action with a difficulty of 4.1 in formal competition as he only started to practice it in January."Starting in January, we've been training with the national team and the efforts seem to have paid off," said Lian."I only tried this action for a few times during tests but never in competitions. I'm quite happy with my performance."The points Lian scored at the men's 10-meter platform, together with the scores Peng Jianfeng clocked at the men's one-meter springboard final, both surpassed the champion scores at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.Zhou Jihong spoke highly of divers' performances at this stop and according to her, the event will be joined with two other national championships in January and May next year to serve as the final reference for the national team's selection for the Tokyo Olympic Games."We should stay confident as everyone works hard, and we remain competitive," said Zhou. "As everything can happen when it comes to competitive sports, the only thing we can do is making sure we are doing our best."(Cover image: Yang Hao of Shaanxi competes during the men's 10-meter platform semifinal at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships in Shijiazhuang, north China's Hebei Province, October 6, 2020. /Xinhua)Formula One is set for a record-breaking weekend when the Nuerburgring hosts the first Eifel Grand Prix on Sunday, with six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton having a second go at matching Michael Schumacher's 91 career wins, while Kimi Raikkonen will line up for his 323rd Grand Prix start after equaling Brazilian Rubens Barrichello's record in Russia two weeks ago. The Finnish 'Iceman,' 40, made his Formula One debut with Sauber in 2001 and is now the oldest man in the race. "Record or not, I am approaching this weekend as any other because once you're in the car, it's pretty much the same," said Alfa Romeo driver Raikkonen, 2007 world champion with Ferrari. "It's not something I care about, not really," he added.

I know she plays really aggressive so I needed to have a better first serve percentage and play aggressive myself; I did a great job overall," said Kenin, who won four of her five matches at Roland Garros in three sets."I guess I like winning in three sets. I know it's tough but I'm getting the job done."After a solid start on both sides, Collins served a woeful double fault to hand Kenin the first break of the match, and a 3-2 lead.She held serve and set up another break point at 4-2 but Collins saved it to stay in contention.Kenin was, however, solid on her service games and she bagged the opening set when her opponent's return sailed wide.It was the first time Kenin took a set against Collins in four encounters, and the fourth seed kept her momentum, breaking again for 3-2 in the second set as her unseeded opponent smacked a forehand long.But this time, Collins hit back to level for 3-3 and she started to threaten Kenin's serve, eventually breaking again to level.The comeback was short-lived, though, as Collins quickly fell 4-0 behind in the decider before taking a medical timeout, holding her midriff as she went off the court for treatment before Kenin easily won the remaining two games.(Cover image: Sofia Kenin in action against Danielle Collins during their quarter-finals match on Court Philippe-Chatrier at the French Open in Paris, France, October 7, 2020. /VCG)Fourth seed Sofia Kenin claimed her maiden French Open semi-final spot as she fought to a 6-4 4-6 6-0 victory against fellow American Danielle Collins on Wednesday.The Australian Open champion was kept on her toes for two sets by an opponent who had beaten her in their previous encounters before strolling through the decider to set up a clash with Czech seventh seed Petra Kvitova.Collins was bothered by abdominal pains in the third set, looking unable to give her maximum effort in the finale on court Philippe Chatrier."This is really special, I'm super happy.

He was one of my favorite players, if not my most favored when I was a teenager," Giroud said in reference to the trophy-laden AC Milan legend.  "I'll just carry on and see how far it goes," the Chelsea star added. Now the only player stands in front of him is Thierry Henry, who leads with 51 goals in 123 caps. Judging by Giroud's current fine form, it won't be long before he surpasses the former Arsenal icon.Giroud is accustomed to keeping a low profile and sometimes doesn't get the appreciation he deserves, but he showed the burning fire of ambition when asked whether he was targeting Henry's record. "There's no limit. You have to set yourself goals," observed Giroud. "Let's see when I reach 46, 47 goals."  It was also a historic night for Eduardo Camavinga. The Rennes starlet became the youngest debutant since 1914 last month with an appearance off the bench against Croatia. On Wednesday, Camavinga made history again as he was given his first start in national team color by Didier Deschamps. The youngster duly repaid his coach's trust by delivering an audacious overhead flick for the opener, thus becoming the youngest player to score for France in 106 years. Barcelona striker Antoine Griezmann, PSG talisman Kylian Mbappe, and Bayern Munich's Corentin Tolisso were also on the scoresheet, capping off a wonderful outing for France. Meanwhile, in Lisbon, Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo failed to get off the mark with a goal despite a lively performance against Spain in front of about 2,500 home fans in the stands. The clash served as a test for Portuguese authorities, as 5 percent of the capacity of the Jose Alvalade Stadium was filled, with attendants sitting apart from each other and sticking to social distancing rules. With supporters cheering him on, Ronaldo had a golden chance to break the deadlock just before the hour mark, but the Juventus superstar hit the crossbar with a powerful shot from inside the area.  Atletico Madrid's Joao Felix, who replaced Ronaldo in the 73rd, nearly notched a later winner at the death but fluffed his lines. Before the match, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) announced that Spain and Portugal have signed an agreement to push ahead with their joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup.Spain hosted in World Cup once in 1982, but Portugal has never staged a World Cup before. "Few things can generate more hope and anticipation than the opportunity to organize a World Cup, and we can't think of a better companion than Portugal," said RFEF president Luis Rubiales in a statement. Elsewhere, Germany midfielder Florian Neuhaus scored on his debut, but Turkey came back three times to earn a 3-3 draw. It was Germany's third stalemate in a row and the third straight time that they have failed to win after taking the lead. "I'm disappointed and frustrated. We have had this problem for a while, and the same thing happened in other games," said Germany coach Joachim Low. In other games, Croatia won 2-1 away in Switzerland, while Italy thrashed Moldova 6-0.

After I found rhythm and confidence," Djokovic said afterwards on Court Philippe Chatrier on another damp and chilly night."It was important to stay focused.

He had already won the world cross country championship five months earlier.Up to Wednesday Cheptegei only had the 18th quickest time over the distance with a best in Doha of 26min 48.36secs, over half a minute outside the record.But his performance in August boded well and he was assisted by some rapid pacemakers, notably the Kenyan Nicholas Kimeli who was a world finalist over 5,000 meters, and electronic timing along the track.Another factor for the fan of Manchester United was his footwear, Nike's carbon-plated Nike Vaporfly worn by Ethiopia's Gidey when she ran the earlier 5,000 meters in 14 minutes 6.62 seconds.The 22-year-old was lowering the previous mark of 14min 11.15 held by her compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba since 2008 by over four seconds.Gidey put up the run of her short career a year after taking 10,000 meters silver at the world athletics championships in Doha.With two pacemakers helping her record bid until the 3,000 meters marker Gidey maintained a ferocious pace to etch her name in athletics' record books."I'm happy," said Gidey.

coronavirus-postponed Tokyo Olympics will be slashed by $280 million, organizers said Wednesday, touting a scaled-back, less flashy Games, with cuts to everything from staffing to pyrotechnics.But the final cost of the event -- officially budgeted before the pandemic at 1.3 trillion yen ($12 billion) -- remains unclear because additional expenses caused by the postponement have not yet been made public."Tokyo 2020 believes that this work will help to create a model for future global events including forthcoming Games amid the new normal in which we now live," organizers said in a statement after a presentation to the International Olympic Committee Executive Board. They said they would put out an updated budget, including additional costs linked to postponement and coronavirus counter-measures, by the end of the year. Plans for a lower-key event were unveiled in late September, with measures including fewer free tickets, scrapping athlete welcome ceremonies, and savings on banners, mascots and pyrotechnics. The final shape of the Games remains unclear, with questions including whether spectators will be allowed -- including foreign visitors -- yet to be resolved. The

players, coaches and non-sporting staff to adapt to the huge losses suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a club source said on Wednesday. Staff have been notified by the club of the need to reduce costs after posting a loss of 97 million euros ($113.98 million) in their annual financial report, released on Monday. The employees, including players, have been asked to nominate a representative over the next two weeks to represent them in the negotiations over the changes to their salaries, added the source. Like every major sporting competition, La Liga faced huge disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pausing for three months mid-season before completing the final rounds of fixtures without fans which hit income from ticket sales and merchandise. Barca's accounts on Wednesday made for grim reading, showing a 14 percent drop in revenue from the previous year and the doubling of their net debt to 488 million euros. The club enacted a temporary pay cut of 70 percent at the end of March in the height of the pandemic, lasting the duration of Spain's national state of alarm, which ended in June. Barca's financial troubles also led them to spend the close season lightening the biggest wage bill in European football, offloading Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal for next to nothing, while selling Arthur Melo for 72 million euros and Nelson Semedo for 30 million. They only brought in three players, Miralem Pjanic, Francisco Trincao and Sergino Dest for a combined 112 million euros. They failed to make any extra additions before the transfer window shut on Monday, despite showing interest in Manchester City defender Eric Garcia and Olympique Lyonnais forward Memphis Depay. Meanwhile, Spanish club Valencia did not sign any players in the transfer window due to a 100 million euros fall in revenue as a result of the coronavirus, despite letting eight key squad members leave in the close season. (With input from Reuters)Barcelona have begun a process to reduce the pay of players, coaches and non-sporting staff to adapt to the huge losses suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a club source said on Wednesday. Staff have been notified by the club of the need to reduce costs after posting a loss of 97 million euros ($113.98 million) in their annual financial report, released on Monday. The employees, including players, have been asked to nominate a representative over the next two weeks to represent them in the negotiations over the changes to their salaries, added the source. Like every major sporting competition, La Liga faced huge disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pausing for three months mid-season before completing the final rounds of fixtures without fans which hit income from ticket sales and merchandise. Barca's accounts on Wednesday made for grim reading, showing a 14 percent drop in revenue from the previous year and the doubling of their net debt to 488 million euros. The club enacted a temporary pay cut of 70 percent at the end of March in the height of the pandemic, lasting the duration of Spain's national state of alarm, which ended in June. Barca's financial troubles also led them to spend the close season lightening the biggest wage bill in European football, offloading Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal for next to nothing, while selling Arthur Melo for 72 million euros and Nelson Semedo for 30 million. They only brought in three players, Miralem Pjanic, Francisco Trincao and Sergino Dest for a combined 112 million euros. They failed to make any extra additions before the

James scored 28 points as the Los Angeles Lakers moved to within one win of a 17th NBA championship on Tuesday with a 102-96 victory over the Miami Heat.Humbled by Miami in game three on Sunday, James and the Lakers came roaring back in a hard-fought defensive battle that was finely balanced until Los Angeles pulled away in the closing minutes.The win leaves the Lakers 3-1 up in the best-of-seven series, meaning they can clinch the championship with victory in game five in Orlando on Friday."It felt like both teams were desperate, understanding the situation they had put themselves in," James said afterwards."Trying to get every extra possession, execute offensively, not to make mistakes defensively, that's what it was all about."James started slowly but clicked in the second half to lead the scoring while providing eight assists and hauling down 12 rebounds.Anthony Davis meanwhile finished with 22 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with a vital 15 point contribution.Caldwell-Pope's tally included a three-pointer and a layup in the closing stages that put the Lakers seven points ahead with two minutes remaining.Davis then drained only his second three-pointer of the night with 39.5 seconds left on the clock to give the Lakers a 100-91 lead and effectively seal the contest.Butler, the 40-point hero of Miami's win on Sunday, was restricted to 22 points, frustrated throughout by a commanding defensive display from Davis."He challenges me every night, I challenge him every night," James said of Davis. "We have to do things to help our team win, defensively, and offensively, and he did that tonight â he was spectacular."Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the game had been decided in key moments in the closing stages."There was some moments of truth there at the end, and probably the bottom line is they won those moments of truth," Spoelstra said."It came down to making plays. They just made more plays and more shots to seal it."An attritional contest saw defenses on top throughout, with Miami containing the threat of James and Davis for long periods.James in particular struggled to generate his usual rhythm throughout the first half, giving up five turnovers and scoring just eight points.The Lakers looked to have built a head of steam towards the end of the first quarter, edging into a 27-22 lead after a Kyle Kuzma three-pointer and a driving layup from Alex Caruso.But Miami responded swiftly at the start of the second quarter, transforming a five-point deficit into a 33-29 lead after Jae Crowder's three-pointer.Butler, meanwhile had started smoothly, going five-from-five in the first quarter to move into double figures.Despite Miami's defensive efforts, the Lakers were still able to carve open a series of good looks, only for off-target shooting to let them down.Nevertheless the Lakers had inched into a two-point lead at half-time at 49-47.In the third quarter, James' shooting from distance improved, his first three-pointer of the night coming with a 29-foot effort to put the Lakers ahead at 55-54.A Danny Green bucket was followed by a driving layup from James and the Lakers had suddenly moved into a 59-54 lead.James made another long-range three shortly afterward to put the Lakers 62-57 up with 6:44 left in the third.Davis's first three-pointer of the game from 28 feet put the Lakers seven points clear with two minutes left in the third.The Los Angeles big man closed the quarter with four free throws to leave the Lakers five points clear heading into the fourth.The Lakers maintained that advantage for much of the fourth quarter.Tyler Herro's three-point jump shot cut the Lakers lead to one point at 76-75, but three free throws from Markieff Morris followed by a superb fadeaway from James stretched the Los Angeles cushion to six points midway through the fourth.Butler raised Miami's hopes after tying it at 83-83, but the Lakers pulled away with Caldwell-Pope's three-pointer transition followed by a layup to make it 95-88 with two minutes left on the clock.Rajon Rondo's layup was then followed by a Davis crucial three-pointer with 39.5 seconds left which sealed the win. LeBron James scored 28 points as the Los Angeles Lakers moved to within one win of a 17th NBA championship on Tuesday with a 102-96 victory over the Miami Heat.Humbled by Miami in game three on Sunday, James and the Lakers came roaring back in a hard-fought defensive battle that was finely balanced until Los Angeles pulled away in the closing minutes.The win leaves the Lakers 3-1 up in the best-of-seven series, meaning they can clinch the championship with victory in game five in Orlando on Friday."It felt like both teams were desperate, understanding the situation they had put themselves in," James said afterwards."Trying to get every extra possession, execute offensively, not to make mistakes defensively, that's what it was all about."James started slowly but clicked in the second half to lead the scoring while providing eight assists and hauling down 12 rebounds.Anthony Davis meanwhile finished with 22 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with a vital 15 point contribution.Caldwell-Pope's tally included a three-pointer and a layup in the closing stages that put the Lakers seven points ahead with two minutes remaining.Davis then drained only his second three-pointer of the night with 39.5 seconds left on the clock to give the Lakers a 100-91 lead and effectively seal the contest.Butler, the 40-point hero of Miami's win on Sunday, was restricted to 22 points, frustrated throughout by a commanding defensive display from Davis."He challenges me every night, I challenge him every night," James said of Davis. "We have to do things to help our team win, defensively, and offensively, and he did that tonight â he was spectacular."Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the game had been decided in key moments in the closing stages."There was some moments of truth there at the end, and probably the bottom line is they won those moments of truth," Spoelstra said."It came down to making plays.

Then the Ukrainian Association of Football (FFU) announced on Tuesday that Real Madrid's youngster Andriy Lunin and FC Oleksandriya's veteran Yuriy Pankiv also contracted the virus.Dynamo Kiev's 26-year-old Georguiy Buschan will be the only fit goalie for Ukraine coach Andriy Shevchenko, whose task of preparing for the upcoming UEFA Nations League was further complicated by the withdrawal of five other Shakhtar Donetsk players due to coronavirus concerns."The situation is difficult. Let's see what the organizers say," FFU spokesman Oleksandr Glyvynsky told reporters when asked whether their match against France should be canceled. Meanwhile, the Portuguese football federation confirmed that their defender Jose Fonte will miss Wednesday's friendly with Spain after testing positive for COVID-19.The 36-year-old Lille star, who moved to Chinese Super League side Dalian Yifang in a shocking move in 2018, will be replaced by Granada's Domingos Dauarte, according to their coach Fernando Santos.In Switzerland, the Swiss football federation (SFV) announced that Xherdan Shaqiri, who traveled to St. Gallen ahead of their team's friendly with Croatia on Wednesday, has contracted the coronavirus.He became the third Liverpool player to test positive for the virus in a week, following Spanish midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Senegalese striker Sadio Mane. It remains unclear if Switzerland players who have been in contact with Shaqiri will be quarantined, with SFV only revealing that they will comply with COVID-19 rules imposed by health authorities.Both world champions France and European champions Portugal reported new COVID-19 cases ahead of their international fixtures, while Ukraine were dealt a huge blow after eight players withdrew from the squad due to a surge in coronavirus infections.Lyon right-back Leo Dubois was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 after testing positive following Tuesday evening's training session, according to the French football federation.The 26-year-old was immediately sent home and placed in quarantine with Real Madrid's Ferland Mendy being temporarily drafted in to fill the gap.The side of Didier Deschamps are set to play against Ukraine on Wednesday but the warm-up match has been thrown into chaos after three Ukrainian goalkeepers tested positive for coronavirus.Shakhtar Donetsk's Andriy Pyatov was the first to come down with COVID-19 earlier in the week.

On my level, it's impossible to keep that level of consistency," said Swiatek, who broke the 159th-ranked Trevisan six times."I just stayed, like, really down-to-earth and really positive. I did that pretty well," she said.World number 131 Podoroska, who had never won a Grand Slam main draw match before the tournament, became the first qualifier in the Open era to reach the women's last four at Roland Garros.Swiatek, ranked 54th, is also through to her first major semi-final and cited the success of Osaka, who captured her third Grand Slam title last month, as a factor in her breakout performance."It was inspiring," Swiatek said of Osaka's return to form in New York after an indifferent 18 months for the Japanese star."I also know I can do better sometimes. I just kept working. Naomi is a good example of a player that just did the right work, and result was the effect of that."Podoroska stunned third seed Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-4 and joined exclusive company as only the third female qualifier to make the last four of a Grand Slam.Podoroska will now attempt to become the first qualifier in history to advance to the final of any of the four majors.Alexandra Stevenson reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1999 while Christine Dorey achieved a similar run at the 1978 Australian Open. "My dream is to be number one. That will never change," said Podoroska, whose only other Grand Slam appearance came at the 2016 US Open.""I don't want to wake up," added Podoroska, the first Argentine woman to reach a major semi-final since Paola Suarez in Paris in 2004. Gabriela Sabatini, the 1990 U.S. Open winner, is the country's only women's Grand Slam singles champion.Meanwhile, Argentine and 12th seed Diego Schwartzman defeated U.S. Open champion and third seed Dominic Thiem in a five-hour epic to reach the Roland Garros semi-finals, his first ever Grand Slam last-four appearance.The 28-year-old Schwartzman triumphed 7-6 (7/1), 5-7, 6-7 (6/8), 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 and will face either 12-time champion Rafael Nadal or Italian teenager Jannik Sinner for a place in the final.It was one marathon too many for Thiem, the runner-up in Paris for the last two years, who had needed five sets and three and a half hours to down world number 239 Hugo Gaston in the fourth round.Schwartzman's success came on the same day that compatriot Nadia Podoroska, the world 131st, reached the last-four of the women's singles."Dominic is one of the great players. He is my best friend and I have a lot of respect for him," said Schwartzman. "So this win is very important for me. In the second and third sets, I was going a little crazy and I was screaming at myself because I had so many chances."But, come on, I deserved to win tonight," added Schwartzman who defeated Nadal in the Rome quarter-finals on the eve of the French Open.Thiem had been attempting to reach a fifth successive semi-final in Paris.However, despite crunching 65 winners to his opponent's 47, he committed 81 unforced errors in a match which featured 19 breaks of serve and at five hours and eight minutes was the second longest of the tournament.Iga Swiatek said she drew inspiration from U.S Open winner Naomi Osaka after sweeping into the semi-finals of the French Open on Tuesday by ending the run of her opponent, Italian qualifier Martina Trevisan.The Polish teenager followed up her emphatic win over top seed Simona Halep by defeating Trevisan 6-3, 6-1 to set up a meeting with Argentina's Nadia Podoroska."I just knew that I'm not going to play as perfect as with Simona.

"Roger this morning just confirmed publicly he'll be here," said Tiley in a video conference on Sunday. If Federer shows up at the Melbourne Park by then, it will mark his Grand Slam comeback after a prolonged injury break. In February, the 20-time Grand Slam champion had an arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, which led to him skipping the Dubai, Indian Wells, Bogota, Miami and the French Open. In June, he made a follow-up decision, announcing he would be missing the rest of the season due to a setback during rehabilitation and an additional arthroscopic procedure that followed. "I plan to take the necessary time to be 100 percent ready to play at my highest level," said Federer in a statement on Twitter back then. As revealed by his coach Severin Luthi in a September's interview, Federer has been committed to making a return at Grand Slam tournaments next year and there are plans to begin to take to the court in early October. The last tour-level tournament Federer played was the Australian Open in January this year, where he lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the semifinals. The 2020 Australian Open was the only Grand Slam tournament of the season that was not affected by the coronavirus pandemic; however, going forward, the event has to gear up with all necessary safety measures against the COVID-19."Bubbles" in cities across Australia will be established to accommodate players arriving early, providing them with a safe environment leading up to the Grand Slam."(Players) will have two weeks of quarantine that they will do in cities around Australia, and for those two weeks, we're creating a bubble from the hotel to the courts in a training environment," said the tournament's director Craig Tiley. "By then, we expect the border to be completely open, and we can move from city to city and then come down to Melbourne for the Australian Open for the last two weeks of January."According to Tiley, the tournament will allow up to 50 percent of the public for games. This is significant progress in comparison with this year's U.S. Open, which was played without fans, and the ongoing French Open allows only a handful of spectators.It will also pose a big challenge for tournament organizers as the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, accounts for 90 percent of Australia's 894 COVID-19-related deaths, and is witnessing a recent rise in the number of cases. (Cover image: Roger Federer of Switzerland plays a backhand in his semi-final match against Novak Djokovic of Serbia on day eleven of the 2020 Australian Open at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, January 30, 2020. /VCG)After an injury setback that kept him out for most of the 2020 season, Roger Federer will finally return to competitive tennis at the 2021 Australian Open, slated to start on January 18, 2021. According to the tournament's director and CEO of Tennis Australia Craig Tiley, the Swiss tennis great confirmed he is participating.

"I've worked really hard during the time off and I feel eager to compete and represent this incredible club." The arrival of left-back Telles from Porto for 13.5 million pounds ($23.85 million) is arguably even more important to aid a United defense that has conceded 11 goals in three Premier League games to start the season. "He is a player we have been tracking for some time and his performances over the past few years are exactly what we are looking for," said Solskjaer on the Brazilian international. Thomas Partey has been a long-term target for the Gunners, who have reportedly matched his 50-million-euro buyout clause to bolster their threadbare midfield options. The Ghanian has made 188 appearances for the Spanish giants and was part of the Atletico sides that reached the 2016 Champions League final and beat Arsenal on the way to winning the Europa League in 2018. Uruguayan international Lucas Torreira is expected to go the other way from Arsenal to Atletico on a season-long loan deal. Arsenal have made an impressive start to the season, winning three of their opening four Premier League games, as they aim to return to the Champions League next season for the first time in five years. However, the Londoners have been short in central midfield with Mesut Ozil and Matteo Guendouzi, who has joined Hertha Berlin on a season-long loan, frozen out by Mikel Arteta. Premier League table-toppers Everton signed center-back Ben Godfrey for a reported initial fee of 25 million pounds. Europe's giants busy on transfer final day. Juventus secured one of the hottest properties in Italian football as Federico Chiesa joined from Fiorentina on a two-year loan deal worth 10 million euros with an obligation to buy if certain conditions are met for a further 40 million. English defender Chris Smalling returned to Roma on a permanent deal from Manchester United for 15 million euros after impressing during a loan spell last season. French midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko has also returned to Serie A, joining Napoli on loan from Chelsea. Bayern Munich added a trio of new players as Douglas Costa returned to the Allianz Arena for a second spell on loan from Juventus. The European champions also signed former PSG striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting on a one-year deal and Bouna Sarr from Marseille. However, Barcelona's financial problems meant they could not agree deals for Lyon's Memphis Depay or Manchester City defender Eric Garcia, as the Catalan club revealed 97 million euro losses for the past season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Manchester United swooped for Edinson Cavani, Alex Telles and Amad Diallo on Monday, but Arsenal are expected to complete the biggest deal of transfer deadline day with the arrival of Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey. United were under the spotlight to respond to a humiliating 6-1 home defeat to Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday. Dutch international midfielder Donny van de Beek had been the only addition to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad of the window prior to Monday. Cavani, 33, has been a free agent since leaving Paris Saint-Germain in June and signed a one-year deal with the option for a second season. The Uruguayan scored 200 goals in seven seasons in the French capital to become the club's all-time top goalscorer. "Manchester United is one of the greatest clubs in the world, so it is a real honor to be here," said Cavani.

a rare scene as most sports leagues in the country still limit the audience to a moderate amount. First played in 2007, the charity basketball game was led by the country's iconic basketball legend Yao Ming's YAO Foundation and was aimed at promoting the development of physical education in China's rural regions as well as reuniting society through sport. This year, it set out with a more important mission as it was deliberately staged in Wuhan to pass on the "spirit of sports" and inject energy and passion into the city and local people. Medical staff who worked on the frontline fighting the coronavirus were part of the lineup and a special ceremony was held before the game to pay tribute to the heroes who fought COVID-19. Celebrities such as China's first Winter Olympics gold medalist Yang Yang, renowned news commentator Bai Yansong, actor and philanthropist Pu Cunxin attended the event to leverage their influence and show their support to the cause. The Yao Foundation Charity Game originated from a post-game talk Yao Ming had with former NBA guard Steve Nash, with Nash proposing charity games as a way to raise funds for China's various youth charities. Ten of these games have been held since the first in 2007. "You feel the sense of achievement when each year's Charity Game successfully concludes," said Yao Ming. "As it goes however, I realized that it transformed into some responsibilities and something you can't live without."In 2012, the Yao Foundation Hope Primary School Basketball Season, a project aimed at providing more teenagers in underprivileged regions with the opportunities and resources to play basketball was launched. As of 2019, the foundation had sent out 2,240 volunteers, and almost 1.15 million schoolchildren in rural areas have benefited from the program.The focus on prioritizing children's physical education and development through sports also got passed on to the charity game as, starting in 2013, a special third quarter was designated to feature children players from primary schools. Zhang Jiacheng, the remarkable one-armed teenage basketballer, joined other primary school kids in the Sunday's game and took the event to a climax with his impressive basketball skills. In the end, the Chinese Star Team led by the Chinese national basketball head coach Du Feng overcame the special team comprised of medical staff together with foreign players and entertainment stars 122-107. (Cover image: China's basketball national team player Kyranbek Makan celebrates after scoring during the Yao Foundation charity game in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, October 4, 2020. /VCGBasketball and other sports stars, medical workers, celebrities as well as local children contributed to a memorable charity basketball game on Sunday night in Wuhan to together boost the city's confidence in the post-pandemic era. More than 7,500 cheered the players on at the stadium -

And football, as I said, is a bridge between China and the rest of the world. Everyone plays football."Expanding on that theme, Liu said: "China is still open. And the development of Chinese football needs help from external stakeholders like the AFC (Asian Football Confederation), FIFA and also other federations as well, and other leagues as well.""We are definitely going to carry on with that kind of partnership, working with all the international governing bodies, brands and stakeholders," he added.China are 76th in the FIFA rankings and their chances of reaching the Qatar 2022 World Cup are in the balance, underlining how far they have to go to reach the top.But speaking in Suzhou, where the Chinese Super League is in a "bubble" to thwart the coronavirus, Liu said that failing to qualify will not deter the country from its long-term goals."To win a spot (in Qatar) means a lot to the Chinese, to the country and also the Chinese football community because that boosts the confidence and gives motivation to every stakeholder and to the football community to contribute more to the development of Chinese football," he said."If we fail, you might have a short-term setback, but the president of the central government understands football and that developing football is a process."Along with building a football infrastructure and overhauling grassroots, school and youth systems, the CSL is a crucial part of the determination to be a superpower in the sport.The league made headlines in recent years when a series of well-known foreign players â along with coaches â arrived on generous contracts and for inflated transfer fees.However, the CFA has since introduced measures such as a salary cap so that the largesse is redirected towards developing young Chinese players."We want to be one of the top leagues in Asia, for sure, which we probably already are, but the benchmark is not supposed to be big spending," said Liu. "It's about sustainability."Liu conceded that Oscar and other overseas stars, such as fellow Brazilians Hulk and Paulinho, have boosted the CSL's profile."But has that (expensive foreigners) helped the development of the local players? That's our question mark," he said.Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman picked up where he left off last season with two goals in a 4-0 home rout of Atletico Madrid on Wednesday as the holders got the defense of their Champions League campaign off to a winning start.Coman, whose header settled last season's Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) just 59 days ago in Lisbon, scored Bayern's opening goal, created their second and claimed their fourth behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena."We played very well, I am very happy with my two goals," Coman told Sky Sports."The winning goal in last season's final is a good motivator, but it's in the past now and we have fresh goals this season." Coman saved his best for last with a superb effort, turning the Atletico defense inside out before firing home on 72 minutes.Goals by midfielders Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso, who produced an unstoppable long-range strike from outside the box, added to Atletico's misery in Munich.The defeat was the joint heaviest Atletico has suffered under Diego Simeone, rivaling the 4-0 drubbing dished out at Dortmund almost exactly two years ago.Real Madrid made an embarrassing start in the Champions League on Wednesday as Shakhtar Donetsk pulled off a shock 3-2 win away to 13-time winners Real Madrid in their Champions League Group B opener on Wednesday, despite the Ukrainian side missing 10 players due to injuries and COVID-19.Strikes from Tete and Manor Solomon, either side of a Raphael Varane own-goal, gave the Ukrainian champions a shock lead at the interval and while Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior pulled goals back, Madrid fell short.Fede Valverde thought he had grabbed an equalizer in injury time but his deflected shot was ruled out after VAR showed Vinicius was offside.La Liga champions Madrid, meanwhile, reflected on a second consecutive home defeat after losing 1-0 at their Alfredo di Stefano stadium to promoted Cadiz on Saturday, further denting their confidence ahead of the 'Classico' at Barcelona in three days' time."In the first half we were not worthy of this competition," said Madrid midfielder Modric."It's obvious we need to improve, we lacked confidence today, especially in the first half, but we have to move on, we can't waste any time regretting what has happened."Coach Zidane had insisted ahead of the game that he was not looking to the trip to Barca's Camp Nou but rested several big names against Shakhtar, choosing not to risk captain Sergio Ramos and starting without Toni Kroos and attacking talisman Karim Benzema."I think Madrid underestimated us but we showed our football and our style," said Shakhtar's Korniienko.Romelu Lukaku scored twice, including a last-gasp equalizer, to rescue a 2-2 draw for Inter Milan in their Champions League opener against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday.Lukaku put Inter ahead after 49 minutes in the San Siro only for the Bundesliga club to hit back with a 63rd-minute Ramy Bensebaini penalty and a Jonas Hofmann strike six minutes from time.But Lukaku had the last word sending the ball in from close range in the final minute.Manchester City came from behind to make a winning start in Champions League Group C on Wednesday with a 3-1 victory over Porto at the Etihad Stadium."If I'm being honest, we are struggling at the moment," said City's German midfielder Gundogan."Fernandinho went off at the end, we have players playing in different positions. I am not 100 percent there because I had Covid, we are not all at the same moment."That is the challenge for this season, it's not going to end for a while," he added.Liverpool proved they can cope without Virgil van Dijk as Nicolas Tagliafico's own goal sealed a 1-0 win at Ajax in the opening game of their Champions League campaign on Wednesday (October 21).Critics have claimed Liverpool will struggle without Van Dijk, but Brazilian midfielder Fabinho filled in impressively alongside Joe Gomez at the heart of the defense."It was a good enough performance to win the game, which at moments was pretty wild. It was not one of our sunny shiny world class football days. It was not perfect but the boys fought like crazy," said a more satisfied Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp afterwards.(With input from agencies)Australia's Adam Scott, the winner of 14 PGA Tour titles, withdrew from the U.S. PGA Zozo Championship on Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19. The 40-year-old from Adelaide was going to make his first start since sharing 38th at last month's U.S. Open. Instead, he will begin a self-isolation period under health and safety protocols. Scott will be hoping to get well in time to compete at the Masters, which was moved to November 12-15 in this year's coronavirus-disrupted schedule. Scott, ranked 15th, took his most recent U.S. PGA triumph in February at Riviera. American Jim Herman, the first alternate, replaced Scott in the Zozo field, which tees off Thursday in the opening round at Sherwood Country Club. Also missing from the Zozo field is world No. 1 Dustin Johnson, who tested positive for COVID-19 before last week's CJ Cup at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. Johnson, still feeling low on energy, plans to play next at the Houston Open the week before the Masters. Since the PGA Tour restarted in mid-June following a COVID-forced shutdown, officials have made several attempts to bring back fans but each time they aborted efforts over health and safety concerns. The next two events on the PGA Tour schedule, the Bermuda Championship and Houston Open, plan to allow a limited number of fans. (With input from agencies)Manchester United posted a 23-million-pound ($30 million) loss for the financial year to June 30 as revenues fell due to the coronavirus pandemic and a lack of Champions League football. The fresh spike in COVID-19 cases across Europe is likely to further delay the return of supporters, hurting income from matchday ticket and catering sales, as well as museum tours for the bigger clubs. "Our top priority is to get fans back into the stadium safely and as soon as possible," said United Executive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward. Premier League clubs last week rejected plans put forward by Liverpool and Manchester United for radical changes to the English game's structure and finances and said they would conduct their own review. The Red Devils' wage bill fell by nearly 50 million pounds because player wages fell after the club failed to qualify for the Champions League and because high earners such as Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku were offloaded.United, who have made a mixed start to the new English Premier League season on the pitch, said revenue in the year ended June 30 fell by 19 percent to 509 million pounds, with some fixtures being delayed beyond that date. It gave no financial forecast for the current year.Meanwhile, net debt rose by 10 percent to 474.1 million pounds at the end of June compared with the end of March.The 20-time English champions said the impact of the coronavirus crisis on revenue has been partially offset by lower matchday costs and reduced travel due to the three-month suspension of matches from March to June. (With input from agencies)The virtual World Press Briefing (WPB) for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games kicked off on Monday.The four-day conference, held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has attracted over 400 representatives to tune in including those from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), National Paralympic Committees (NPCs), International Federations (IFs), and worldwide media, among other organizations.Organized by the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee (BOCOG), the online press briefing is an opportunity for stakeholders to familiarize themselves with the ongoing preparations leading up to the Games. Taking into considerations the inability to carry out on-site tours, the conference will take advantage of simulation technology to present the construction and progress, spatial layout, and vehicles and personnel flow designs of the venues. Fifteen functional areas including media operations, venue constructions, registrations, accommodations, transport as well as securities will be touched upon. "Quality services for media organizations are an integral part of our work. We give high priority to media operations and will honor our bid commitments. We have done and will continue to do everything necessary to meet the pre-Games and Games-time needs of the media for Games coverage," Zhang Jiandong, executive vice president of the BOCOG said in his address.Zhang went on to express confidence in Beijing's smooth preparations for the Games despite the challenges brought by the coronavirus and vowed to provide "comprehensive, efficient and convenient" media services.This world press briefing is the first under the watch of Lucia de Montanarella, who was named IOC Media Operations chief in January."I think that the commitment of Beijing 2022 trying to deliver high standard services and facilities to the media is testified by the table that we see, with the top management of BOCOG participating at the opening of this world press briefing," Montanarella said during her opening remarks."It means a lot to the worldwide media to know that BOCOG gives the interests of the media such a high priority in their organization."(Cover image: Beijing 2022 World Press Briefing is held online in Beijing to brief the stakeholders worldwide about the ongoing preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics, Beijing, October 19, 2020. /Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee)(With input from Xinhua news agency)On Chinese social media platforms, video uploaders usually would like to give the title "Foreigners are less series" to some parkour footages. That reflects few of the netizens know there is also a group of people in China playing parkour, and this sport could be aesthetic but not only thrilling.Mucun, born in the 90s in Chongqing, southwest China, is a full-time extreme sports filmmaker, mainly shooting parkour films. Through his works, people could see many aspects of Chinese parkour.During the college stage, Mucun's major had no relation to sports, but he's interested in street dance and other pop cultures. Once for adding a weapon to his breaking dance arsenal, he went to kungfu society to learn somersault, but then, he was attracted by the alumnus who were also playing parkour there.Having an introverted nature, Mucun just did parkour exercise silently and gradually got in touch with China's core parkour athletes in the following years. At the same time, he started to record the playing and tried to make it better.Putting a sports camera on an athlete's body is a general method of taking parkour shots, but that will easily make the audience dizzy. Thus, an eligible parkour cameraman should know about both â how to play parkour and how to get clear images.Sometimes, shooting parkour film could be, to a certain degree, much tiring than just playing it, as the videographer has to run nearly the same route for many times while controlling the camera, paying attention to terrain, machine, and passengers at the same time.But for Mucun personally, the hardest thing is to communicate with athletes, as most of them have formal jobs, parkour is only their hobby, and it's difficult to organize a project with everyone's schedule suitable. Furthermore, when the shooting comes into a challenge, he has to decide whether to persuade the athlete to continue or not."I'm not a person who's good at communicating, and for these years, I have experienced a lot of up and downs on it, fortunately now, I have some faithful friends to cooperate with," Mucun said.As there's rare full-time parkour filmmakers in China, Mucun plays the roles of producer, director, cinematographer, video editor, and special effects maker in most of his projects, and the loneliness makes his career develop slow.While working alone, it still has benefit as he learns many operations of diverse camera equipment during the process. Now, the main types of his work are pure parkour skill show, documentary, and parkour action movie. Besides, he also did some vlogs and films of other extreme sports.To improve his shooting quality, Mucun now attends professional roller skating class regularly. Even though he has quite flexible work, he often gets up at 5:00 a.m. to edit video and arranges his schedule with full activities to 10:00 p.m.Since his first parkour film Super Tramp winning the Banff China Outdoor Film Fest's Best Cinematography Award, Mucun walks on the road of parkour filmmaking more and more confidently. When talking about his goal, he said, "I'd like to make Chinese parkour film to a higher level, and let parkour own everyone's respect."(Video Editor: Li Chenqi)On Chinese social media platforms, video uploaders usually would like to give the title "Foreigners are less series" to some parkour footages.

Once for adding a weapon to his breaking dance arsenal, he went to kungfu society to learn somersault, but then, he was attracted by the alumnus who were also playing parkour there.Having an introverted nature, Mucun just did parkour exercise silently and gradually got in touch with China's core parkour athletes in the following years. At the same time, he started to record the playing and tried to make it better.Putting a sports camera on an athlete's body is a general method of taking parkour shots, but that will easily make the audience dizzy. Thus, an eligible parkour cameraman should know about both â how to play parkour and how to get clear images.Sometimes, shooting parkour film could be, to a certain degree, much tiring than just playing it, as the videographer has to run nearly the same route for many times while controlling the camera, paying attention to terrain, machine, and passengers at the same time.But for Mucun personally, the hardest thing is to communicate with athletes, as most of them have formal jobs, parkour is only their hobby, and it's difficult to organize a project with everyone's schedule suitable. Furthermore, when the shooting comes into a challenge, he has to decide whether to persuade the athlete to continue or not."I'm not a person who's good at communicating, and for these years, I have experienced a lot of up and downs on it, fortunately now, I have some faithful friends to cooperate with," Mucun said.As there's rare full-time parkour filmmakers in China, Mucun plays the roles of producer, director, cinematographer, video editor, and special effects maker in most of his projects, and the loneliness makes his career develop slow.While working alone, it still has benefit as he learns many operations of diverse camera equipment during the process. Now, the main types of his work are pure parkour skill show, documentary, and parkour action movie. Besides, he also did some vlogs and films of other extreme sports.To improve his shooting quality, Mucun now attends professional roller skating class regularly. Even though he has quite flexible work, he often gets up at 5:00 a.m. to edit video and arranges his schedule with full activities to 10:00 p.m.Since his first parkour film Super Tramp winning the Banff China Outdoor Film Fest's Best Cinematography Award, Mucun walks on the road of parkour filmmaking more and more confidently. When talking about his goal, he said, "I'd like to make Chinese parkour film to a higher level, and let parkour own everyone's respect."(Video Editor: Li Chenqi)Every jump matters; every competition counts.

The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.Given that some major U.S. media and politicians made groundless claims that the novel coronavirus originates in China, blamed and slandered China, even asked for an apology from China, then I have every reason to ask 10 questions for the United States about its origin too. Better still, unlike the U.S., I did a lot homework and will base my questions on international media coverage of COVID-19.Question 1Since the director of the U.S. Centers of Disease Control, Robert Redfield admitted that some Americans seemingly dying from flu were tested positive for the novel coronavirus, can I conclude that those people actually died from the novel coronavirus? Among the 34 million influenza patients, with a death toll of 20,000, how many were misdiagnosed?When did the misdiagnoses start? And did it actually start from August 2019? These questions are so vital that the world is waiting for an explanation from the United States.Question 2When there were some misdiagnoses admitted by U.S. CDC, I'm scratching my head â isn't the U.S. that owns the best medical technologies in the world? Why did that happen?As the ground glass opacity (white patches) can be easily seen in CT scans of the lungs of patients with the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, it should have been an easy thing to separate the cases of COVID-19 and H1N1 flu. But why were there so many misdiagnoses?Well, that reminds me of the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's request of controlling all messaging regard to the coronavirus. Why does the White House call for messaging control? Does the U.S. need to hide something? Are they plotting some conspiracy?Question 3Why did the U.S. withdraw from the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 2001? Why did it try to prevent a monitoring mechanism for the execution of the Convention? Is it standing in the way of developing biological weapon for the U.S.?If not, why are there new biological laboratories in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan? Are those labs for biochemical warfare? It's impossible that they are keeping viruses as pets. If the U.S. is aiming at provoking a biochemical war, who would be the first target then? Also, how about the swine flu outbreak in China last year? The odd thing is that it broke out in different places simultaneously instead of breaking out separately. Why were drones used to poison the pigs? Was the U.S. behind all that? I heard that it was the pork speculators. But that theory makes no sense â since the swine flu killed millions of pigs in China during the same period of time, pork speculators would suffer great loss instead of profits.The best possible answer to that was foreign meddling. I was among those who wondered if the U.S. had anything to do with that and hoped for an explanation.Question 4The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, located on Fort Detrick, Maryland, was shut down in July 2019. Was it because there was a virus leakage incident?Just one month later, there was an influenza outbreak across the country. Were those two things related in any way?Were the misdiagnoses simply cooked up to cover up such secrets? Did that also become a motive for the U.S. to shift the blame to other countries by labeling them as the origin of the novel coronavirus?Was that an epic coincidence or a dirty secret in disguise? Why did the U.S. erase huge number of English news reports on the internet covering the shutdown in March 2020? Is there anything to hide, or is there anything to worry about?Question 5At the 7th Military World Games (October 18-27, 2019) held in Wuhan, why did the U.S. team (369 members) win ZERO gold medal? Did that even look like a reasonable record for the world's leading military power? Did your government do it on purpose?Was anyone among the 369 participants ever (mis)diagnosed with influenza? Was it possible they were carriers of the novel coronavirus?The best thing for the U.S. now is to stop burying its head in the sand and give the 369 people PCT tests to see if they are infected.Question 6Why did the U.S. hold Event 201, a global pandemic exercise in October 2019? Why was the CIA deputy director participating it? Is it because the U.S. has foreseen a highly-infectious virus is about to cause a pandemic? One month later, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were detected in China and there was a pandemic three months later. Probably, it's not just a coincidence.Question 7Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran all reported that many of their first COVID-19 confirmed cases had no exposure history with China but showed connection with the United States. How come?Genetic research shows that the type of novel coronavirus found in China belongs to Group C, but Group A and Group B viruses â Group C's parental and grand parental viruses â are both found in the United States. Why? A Japanese patient was diagnosed with influenza in Hawaii but was tested positive for COVID-19 when he returned to Japan. How to explain that?Some COVID-19 cases in the U.S. had no connection with China whatsoever. So where does it come from?Question 8You've got no reason to deny that the 1918 Pandemic originated within your territory. But you let Spain bear the blame for as long as a century. Don't you feel shame on that?History seems to repeat itself. So, is the U.S. playing the trick again and attempting to label the novel coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus"?Question 9The 1918 Pandemic, causing 1 billion infections, with a death toll "estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million... one of the deadliest epidemics in human history," according to wikipedia, was proven originating in the U.S., but the U.S. has never apologized to the world. So far, the origin of the novel coronavirus is still unknown, but the United States is requiring China for an apology, how ridiculous is that! Just to remind the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic killing 300,000 people also originated in the U.S., and also the same for HIV AIDS. So why not confess to the world?Question 10In movies, the U.S. is fond of playing the role of the world savior. The image of Captain America is one of its most popular symbols. However, in reality, in the face of a disaster like COVID-19, where is Captain America?The U.S. is not doing enough to protect its citizens at home or on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It even attempted to make Japan responsible for Americans on Diamond Princess. How does the U.S. have the brass to do all these and accuse China of being irresponsible?While China bought the world valuable time to battle COVID-19, the U.S. accused China of being passive and lacking transparency. Well, when the White House instructed the CDC to stop tallying the people tested for novel coronavirus, did that count as transparency? When the U.S. government advised its people not to wear masks, was it not being passive? Just too many questions call for the U.S.'s explanations.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.)The 7th Military World Games took place in China's Wuhan from October 18 to 27. In this video, people around the world expressed their feelings about this sports feast.It was yet another bittersweet moment for me as I completed my role in covering the 7th Military World Games.I knew nothing about the games and admittedly had not heard of it prior to attending, but now I takeaway with me something more."Friendship through sports" is the motto of the games, and this really shined through in Wuhan, China. I saw it with my own eyes and felt it with my heart how new friends and connections are forged not just between the army of different countries but also within a country.The military games is, after all, a multi-sport event â 27 sports, in fact. A military Olympics indeed it was. It's the scale of this event and the sense of a "big family" that differentiates it from other individual sports games, many athletes told me.A few things stood out to me in my reporting.First, many of the international athletes I've spoken to have competed worldwide, but it's their very first time in China. So, it was nice to hear what they think and have to say about the country.Second, many of the athletes have their own lives and jobs outside of the military.Cecilia Sjoeholm from Sweden is one of them. She works as a part-time chef in the Swedish Armed Forces."It has given me friendship, and that's the most important thing. I would not have done it for 10 years if it wasn't for my Swedish friends, people I love, and my friends in the naval pentathlon team from around the world. They're friends forever, and that's why it makes this sport so special," she told me.I've seen how the females compete in the naval pentathlon, and boy, it isn't easy. It features five events: an obstacle course, life-saving swimming, utility swimming, seamanship, and an amphibious cross-country race."The core skill in naval pentathlon is the physical strength, the mental stability which is very needed out in the sea when it could be very cold, rainy, you're wet and tired,"  Swedish team captain Joakim Hiertner said.Another naval pentathlon athlete from Poland, Edyta Korczak told me,  "It makes me feel like I have another family. I can compete with them, but we can be best friends. This is the best thing about sports."Military capabilities and sports skills aside, it's also about the way different countries approach the sport.It may be 23-year old Bianca Caruso's first time in China, but she has competed worldwide and with the Chinese for a couple of years now."I think Chinese are really humble sailors. They are really quiet, always focused on what they are doing. I think what we can learn from them is for sure because we Italians are... kind of jokers," she told me.Likewise, Hu Rong from the sailing competition management committee said there is much that the Chinese can learn from international athletes."It's like their love for the sport comes from within, and they do things with feeling. When they align their boats, the 470s, they do it with attention to detail," Hu Rong said. "We Chinese can also learn how to just simply enjoy the process of competing from the international athletes that and their flexibility in changing roles on the boat."Truly, many life lessons can be gained from sports. For example, I learned from Hu Rong that with sailing the most important skill required is adaptability."This is the number one thing I teach my students because when you have the ability to adapt well, you can change your techniques to navigate different environments. In sailing, adaptability can make up for what you lack in physical strength," she said.Meanwhile, a sport you might not have linked to military sports is golf. Hence, the reason I pitched this story.Nicolas Calvet, a golfer from France, told me that golf has many worthwhile life lessons that can be applied to in one's life and job."Golf has given me a lot, personally and in the job because it teaches you to be really humble and to be honest with yourself," Calvet said. "If you make a mistake, it's nobody's fault but yours. And in the military role, if you can't just look at yourself and say that's me; I'm this, and I have this; you can't go anywhere."I am not sure, but I don't think many other sports allow you to spend over 4-5 hours competing with your small group of teammates.As Arjan De Haas from the Netherlands said, "You can talk about their family, about their homes, what they do at home. We're all in the army, but we're in different parts of the army. So, it's nice to talk about it."As the Games come to a close, I think it's important to take a step back and ponder why is there a need to gather military personnel on the field of sports?According to Major Jan-Henrik Baeck, a board member of the International Sports Military Council (CISM), the most important thing for soldiers to have a platform to meet is that they set up new networks."You set up new connections with other people that you have not reached before," Baeck said."For instance, when I go to a competition, I meet some people from China and Korea, and two years later, I'm in an international mission, and I reach my same buddies that I've reached before, and we are on speaking terms directly. So, this is one of the best things with this community."Now, how can I end this piece without mentioning the Athletes' Village! A place where I called my second home in the past two weeks.To be sure, I don't live there, but almost 10-thousand athletes, coaches and officials from over 100 countries did.It was pretty embarrassing that people I met who saw me at some of the games said to me at the village, "Hey Lynn how are your interviews going?" and proceeded to ask others around us if I have interviewed them yet. Well, I call it devotion to the job!My respect for sportsmen and women just went up a notch. Sports can truly shape a person's life for the better as many athletes have told me, and can bring about friendship and camaraderie on and beyond the field.I may not be a professional athlete who travels around the world, but I have my job where I can explore and bring these stories to all of you.And this alone is enough for me. I had a great time covering the 7th Military World Games and I have, along the way, gained many friends globally and learned from their stories.Also, I'm not sure if this already exists, but wouldn't it be nice to have a Journalist World Games perhaps? Gathering journalists of the world in the field of sports? Every profession needs an outlet to let loose and showcase one's talent and passion, after all.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), signed an order on Monday to reward the Chinese athletes and coaches that participated in the 7th Military World Games in Wuhan, central China.Xi pointed out that the Chinese athletes and coaches, as representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force, had fought all out in the competition, sharing friendship and safeguarding peace while vying for sporting achievements and pursuing sportsmanship. Their performances have won honors for the country as well as for the PLA.Xi emphasized that the historic breakthrough by the Chinese delegation in the 7th Military World Games was achieved with the PLA Sports Delegation keeping the instructions of the CMC in their mind and with the goal of "first-class competition and first-class performances."The order called for the Chinese athletes and coaches to cherish the honor without being arrogant, and to look to achieve greater glories in the future. The order also called on the entire army to learn from the Military World Games' Chinese participants, as well as fighting for the goal of strengthening the PLA while striving to develop a world-class army.The 7th Military World Games, the biggest ever "Olympics for the military," closed on Sunday after 10 days of competition, as hosts China collected 133 golds and 239 medals in total, the first time a country has earned over a 100 gold medals.Held from October 18 to 27, the quadrennial event attracted a record number of participants, with nearly 10,000 officers and soldiers from 109 countries competing in 27 sports.Read more:7th Military World Games closes in ChinaAfter a historic 10 days of competition in Wuhan, central China, the 7th Military World Games wrapped up with an exciting closing ceremony with the theme of friendship. Watch my vlog for a closer look at the special night.It all began on one cloudy day in May 2015 when the central Chinese city of Wuhan dropped a bombshell announcing that it had won the bid to host the 2019 Military World Games â a grand gathering of thousands of soldiers from around the world and second only to the Olympics in terms of scale.There were fears that Wuhan might not be up to the task of staging China's most important international sporting event since 2008. In addition, there were serious concerns over whether there would be a clear social and economic rationale for the event that goes beyond simply hosting a limelight-hogging extravaganza.The unyielding support, cooperation and dedication from all levels of government had raised the hopes of the Wuhan organizers, but a race against time to develop and upgrade the city's infrastructure dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the never-ending construction projects grew louder.Fast forward four years and the tables have turned. The 2019 Military World Games concluded gloriously after bedazzling the world with sporting brilliance, unprecedented geographical reach, unwavering promotion of peace and friendship, and unrivaled spectacle of opening and closing ceremonies.Within a span of 10 days, the highlights flowed thick and fast. Under the motto "Share friendship, build up peace," a record 9,308 military personnel from 109 countries and regions graced the stage in Wuhan in a record 27 events. China achieved its best-ever gold medal haul of 133 on the back of thorough preparations, steely commitment and virtuoso performances. With 67 Olympic and world champions turning out for the jamboree, seven world records were smashed and 85 International Military Sports Commission (CISM) affiliated records were broken. CISM President Herve Piccirillo, who was a living embodiment of jollity and cheerfulness at the closing gala on Sunday, showered praise on Wuhan, saying the hosts "have excellently completed the mission" and the Military World Games will leave the city "unparalleled tangible and intangible heritage for the future generations." It evidently helped that so many locals were extremely zealous about the Games, which were truly omnipresent as special banners and flags found their way into every nook and cranny of Wuhan. It was the first time all competitions for the Games were staged in a single city, and to the pleasant surprise of the organizers, the tickets to a host of events became the hottest commodity in Wuhan. The organizers said more than 600,000 tickets were flying off the shelves. The atmosphere within the 5G-powered venues was second to none. From the intensity of the Naval Pentathlon at Mulan to the thrill of the Parachuting at Hannan and the zest of the Orienteering at Jiangxia, exhilarated crowds packed out almost every venue. For the memorable moments in the Wuhan Sports Center, at the Yishan Golf Club or on East Lake, the buzz stood comparison with any sporting event ever held in China.That's due in no small part to over 250,000 volunteers, who are frequently the unsung heroes when it comes to the crunch. The sense of warmth, intelligence, proficiency and humility they brought to long days of performing ordinary tasks in their eye-catching white-and-green uniforms was noteworthy and highly commendable. Their firm belief that they were part of something bigger rubbed off on the rest of the city.By any measure, Wuhan has delivered on its promise of fostering international cooperation and building peace through sport. As Piccirillo said, "Beyond the Games, it is all the Chinese people who are spreading this message of solidarity and peace."Moreover, the newly-built Athletes' Village, stretching over 565,000 square meters, earned rave reviews and successfully served as a bridge between a swathe of different cultures. Sports fields were noted for some endearing interactions among soldiers who merrily traded lapel pins that were made as mementos of each Games. Wuhan also deserves praise for meticulous attention to detail in planning and obsessive focus on efficiency. The smooth performance of its various transport systems provided more than enough insurance during the fortnight when the huge deluge of visitors descended on the metropolis.One thing Wuhan did exceptionally well was to carry out a roadmap that was underpinned by a responsible fiscal strategy. Instead of hosting the Games as an end in itself, the organizers put top priority on its long-term sustainability. From the very beginning, creating a post-Games legacy was at the heart of their planning.  The major infrastructure of the Games was designed and located with future housing and commercial development in mind. Even the Main Media Center, where all furniture and equipment were on loan from contractors, will be turned into a multipurpose gymnasium featuring an indoor ice rink, a fencing hall and an archery training center.Wuhan is fully capitalizing on the opportunity to leverage the Games to accelerate its extraordinary metamorphosis from an economic backwater into an international hub for business and tourism.There is no doubt that hosting the Games significantly bolstered Wuhan's profile and provided timely momentum for the city to start and finish projects that had been deliberated upon for years, including the world's longest double-deck suspension bridge, Yangsigang Yangtze River Bridge, Asia's largest underground urban complex in Optics Valley Square, and multiple new subway lines that spread out throughout the town.The impressive numbers back up that claim. According to Xinhua, over the past three years, Wuhan renovated 1,300 kilometers of its urban roads and saw its metro network reach 330 kilometers in total length. Meanwhile, a staggering 360,000 trees were planted.With its newfound international recognition, proven ability to stage massive sporting events and enormously positive impact on the Chinese psyche, Wuhan has even been touted as one of the potential candidates to host the 2032 Olympics. As described by Piccirillo, "The multiple venues built in line with highest standards in the world can serve any future international sports event that Wuhan may step up to host."For Wuhan observers and local residents, this rosy picture was far beyond their wildest dreams a decade ago. Basking in the success of the 7th Military World Games, Wuhan has immensely elevated its global status, and the social, economic and cultural impacts of the event will reach far beyond the lifespan of two weeks.Today, Wuhan is no longer in the shadows. The days are gone when the city's majestic Yellow Crane Tower and luscious hot dry noodles were almost unheard of outside China. The world is starting to take notice, and this is exactly the kind of publicity that money can't buy.Wuhan, the capital city of central China's Hubei Province, said goodbye to the 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games, the first international military multi-sport event held in China, with a closing ceremony on Sunday night.Col. Dorah Mamby Koita, Secretary General of the International Military Sports Council, presented the Fair Play Award to Col. Bertrand Gebuhrer, chief of the French delegation during the closing ceremonies of the World Military Games Sunday. The award is presented in recognition of sportsmanship, fair play and contributions to promoting the ideals and values of CISM.The 7th CISM Military World Games concluded in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, on Sunday.Team China, also the largest sports group at the Games, topped the medal table with a total of 133 gold medals, 64 silver medals and 42 bronze medals.CGTN takes you through a brief history of the Chinese delegation in military sports.1951 In September, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) founded its first professional sports team, which included football, basketball, volleyball, track and field, swimming, lifting, gymnastics, and other sports as branches. The name, the August First Team or Bayi in Chinese, is because the PLA was founded on August 1, 1927.1978PLA observers attended the 32nd Congress of the International Military Sports Council (CISM), marking China starting its official military sports ties with the world.1981For the first time, the August First military pentathlon team participated in the 30th World Military Pentathlon Championship, and finished eighth among the 13 participating teams. 1982In December, the PLA founded its military sports team based in one of the competitive sports training centers for soldiers. The team focused on five events: shooting, military pentathlon, horse riding in modern pentathlon, fencing and triathlon (including cycling).2016-2018Institutional reforms that aimed at managing and optimizing sports resources implemented according to the PLA deepening reform plan.Under the newly launched Military Sports Training Center, a total of 29 discipline teams were set up. They included shooting, track and field, swimming, basketball, skiing, military pentathlon, and also added military-focused disciplines such as naval pentathlon, aeronautical pentathlon, and orienteering.Clayton Kershaw, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts â the Los Angeles Dodgers stars all shined.Nothing out of the ordinary there, even if the setting was surreal.Baseball's best team during the pandemic-shortened season showed off its many talents in the first World Series game played at a neutral site, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.With the seats mostly empty, Kershaw dominated for six innings, Bellinger and Betts homered and the Dodgers chased a wild Tyler Glasnow in the fifth inning and coasted home in the opener.A crowd limited by the coronavirus to 11,388 at Globe Life Field, the new $1.2-billion home of the Texas Rangers, marked the smallest for baseball's top event in 111 years.Los Angeles hopes to go home with a title that has eluded the Dodgers since 1988 but tried to guard against focusing ahead."It's hard not to think about winning. It's hard not to think about what that might be like," Kershaw said. "Constantly keep putting that in your brain: tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow. And then you do that three more times, and you can think about it all you want."A regular season star with an erratic postseason history, Kershaw looked like the ace who so often stars on midsummer evenings with the San Gabriel Mountains behind him at Dodger Stadium. With these games shifted, the 32-year-old left-hander wound up pitching not far from his off season home in Dallas.The three-time Cy Young Award winner allowed one run and two hits, struck out eight and walked one. He induced 19 swings and misses among his 78 pitches â more than his three previous Series starts combined."You can appreciate and totally see why he's heading to the Hall of Fame one day whenever he's done," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.Kershaw threw nine balls in the first, when he stranded a pair of runners, then threw just nine more over the next three innings."He had a game plan to try to really quiet down things from there and he executed," said Kevin Kiermaier, who ended Kershaw's streak of 13 retired in a row with a fifth-inning homer on a hanging slider that cut the Rays' deficit to 2-1.Kershaw, a five-time ERA champ, improved to 2-2 in the World Series and 12-12 in postseason play, a shadow of his 175-76 regular season record. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts did not pitch him after Game 4 of the NL Championship Series last Thursday."I think we were going to stay away from him in Game 7 just for this particular reason," Roberts said.Game 2 is Wednesday night. The Dodgers, who posted the best record in the majors during the shortened season and showed off all their stars in Game 1, plan to throw a collection of pitchers started by Tony Gonsolin against Rays ace Blake Snell.Eight of the last 10 teams to win Game 1 went on the title, all except the 2016 Indians and 2017 Dodgers.Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP who began the opener with a career .114 batting average in 12 World Series games, had put the Dodgers ahead in the fourth with a two-run homer off Glasnow, having no trouble driving a 98 mph pitch into the Dodgers bullpen in right-center.Bellinger, whose seventh-inning homer put the Dodgers ahead in Game 7 of the NL Championship on Sunday, shuffled his feet, tapping gently as he crossed the plate and celebrated by toe tapping teammates while dancing back to the dugout, a sign he remembered popping his right shoulder during raucous revelry two nights earlier.He capped his evening by leaping at the 6-foot center field wall in the ninth, robbing Austin Meadows of a possible home run."I said it today before the game: If I hit one I'm not touching anybody's arm," Bellinger said. "I'm going straight foot, and it was pretty funny."Betts, brilliant throughout October but slumping at the plate, added his first postseason homer for the Dodgers, an opposite-field solo shot to right in the sixth off Josh Fleming.Betts had two hits, scored two runs and stole two bases in the four-run fifth, when Corey Seager swiped one as Los Angeles became the first team to steal three bases in a Series inning since the 1912 New York Giants in Game 5 against Boston."That's a weak spot of my game, holding runners," Glasnow said. "Has to be something I focus on more in the future. "Betts became the first to hit a home run, steal two bases and score twice in a Series game."Stolen bases are a thing for me. That's how I create runs and create havoc on the basepaths," he said.Los Angeles is in the Series for the third time in four years but seeking its first title since the Kirk Gibson- and Orel Hershiser-led team of 32 years ago. Coming off an unusual LCS of games on seven straight days, the Dodgers planned an all-bullpen outing for the next game.Tampa Bay was held to six hits. Its only previous Series was a five-game loss to Philadelphia in 2008.Glasnow was chased after 4 1/3 innings with an ominous pitching line that included three hits, six runs, six walks and eight strikeouts. He threw a career-high 112 pitches and became the first to walk six or more in a series game since Edwin Jackson of St. Louis in Game 4 of 2011. Glasnow went to three-ball counts on 12 of 23 batters.Los Angeles expanded its lead to 4-1 in the fifth, when Cash left Glasnow in to face left-handed-hitting Max Muncy with runners at the corners. Muncy hit a one-hopper to first baseman Yandy DÃ­az with the infield in, and Betts beat a strong but slightly offline throw with a headfirst slide past catcher Mike Zunino.Will Smith finished Glasnow with an RBI single, and Chris Taylor and pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez followed with run-scoring singles off Ryan Yarbrough for a 6-1 lead.Justin Turner and Muncy doubled on consecutive pitches in the sixth.Pinch-hitter Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs in the seventh against Victor Gonzalez, who snagged Zunino's line drive and doubled Brosseau off second base for an inning-ending double play.After a regular season played without fans, MLB resumed selling tickets with a limited amount for the NLCS at Globe Life and kept that up by allowing about 28 percent of capacity to be filled at the 40,518-seat ballpark, where the roof was open. The crowd was widely dispersed throughout and was the smallest for the Series since 10,535 attended Game 6 between the Pirates and Tigers at Detroit's Bennett Park in 1909, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.An overwhelming majority of fans wore Dodger blue."They're everywhere. They always come out," Kershaw said. "And so for as much as a game as we would have liked it to have been at Dodger Stadium and the 56,000 chanting, after everything that's gone on this season, to have 10-, 11,000 people in the stands and a good bit of them being Dodger fans is pretty cool."Clayton Kershaw, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts â the Los Angeles Dodgers stars all shined.Nothing out of the ordinary there, even if the setting was surreal.Baseball's best team during the pandemic-shortened season showed off its many talents in the first World Series game played at a neutral site, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.With the seats mostly empty, Kershaw dominated for six innings, Bellinger and Betts homered and the Dodgers chased a wild Tyler Glasnow in the fifth inning and coasted home in the opener.A crowd limited by the coronavirus to 11,388 at Globe Life Field, the new $1.2-billion home of the Texas Rangers, marked the smallest for baseball's top event in 111 years.Los Angeles hopes to go home with a title that has eluded the Dodgers since 1988 but tried to guard against focusing ahead."It's hard not to think about winning. It's hard not to think about what that might be like," Kershaw said. "Constantly keep putting that in your brain: tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow. And then you do that three more times, and you can think about it all you want."A regular season star with an erratic postseason history, Kershaw looked like the ace who so often stars on midsummer evenings with the San Gabriel Mountains behind him at Dodger Stadium. With these games shifted, the 32-year-old left-hander wound up pitching not far from his off season home in Dallas.The three-time Cy Young Award winner allowed one run and two hits, struck out eight and walked one. He induced 19 swings and misses among his 78 pitches â more than his three previous Series starts combined."You can appreciate and totally see why he's heading to the Hall of Fame one day whenever he's done," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.Kershaw threw nine balls in the first, when he stranded a pair of runners, then threw just nine more over the next three innings."He had a game plan to try to really quiet down things from there and he executed," said Kevin Kiermaier, who ended Kershaw's streak of 13 retired in a row with a fifth-inning homer on a hanging slider that cut the Rays' deficit to 2-1.Kershaw, a five-time ERA champ, improved to 2-2 in the World Series and 12-12 in postseason play, a shadow of his 175-76 regular season record. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts did not pitch him after Game 4 of the NL Championship Series last Thursday."I think we were going to stay away from him in Game 7 just for this particular reason," Roberts said.Game 2 is Wednesday night. The Dodgers, who posted the best record in the majors during the shortened season and showed off all their stars in Game 1, plan to throw a collection of pitchers started by Tony Gonsolin against Rays ace Blake Snell.Eight of the last 10 teams to win Game 1 went on the title, all except the 2016 Indians and 2017 Dodgers.Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP who began the opener with a career .114 batting average in 12 World Series games, had put the Dodgers ahead in the fourth with a two-run homer off Glasnow, having no trouble driving a 98 mph pitch into the Dodgers bullpen in right-center.Bellinger, whose seventh-inning homer put the Dodgers ahead in Game 7 of the NL Championship on Sunday, shuffled his feet, tapping gently as he crossed the plate and celebrated by toe tapping teammates while dancing back to the dugout, a sign he remembered popping his right shoulder during raucous revelry two nights earlier.He capped his evening by leaping at the 6-foot center field wall in the ninth, robbing Austin Meadows of a possible home run."I said it today before the game: If I hit one I'm not touching anybody's arm," Bellinger said. "I'm going straight foot, and it was pretty funny."Betts, brilliant throughout October but slumping at the plate, added his first postseason homer for the Dodgers, an opposite-field solo shot to right in the sixth off Josh Fleming.Betts had two hits, scored two runs and stole two bases in the four-run fifth, when Corey Seager swiped one as Los Angeles became the first team to steal three bases in a Series inning since the 1912 New York Giants in Game 5 against Boston."That's a weak spot of my game, holding runners," Glasnow said. "Has to be something I focus on more in the future. "Betts became the first to hit a home run, steal two bases and score twice in a Series game."Stolen bases are a thing for me. That's how I create runs and create havoc on the basepaths," he said.Los Angeles is in the Series for the third time in four years but seeking its first title since the Kirk Gibson- and Orel Hershiser-led team of 32 years ago. Coming off an unusual LCS of games on seven straight days, the Dodgers planned an all-bullpen outing for the next game.Tampa Bay was held to six hits. Its only previous Series was a five-game loss to Philadelphia in 2008.Glasnow was chased after 4 1/3 innings with an ominous pitching line that included three hits, six runs, six walks and eight strikeouts. He threw a career-high 112 pitches and became the first to walk six or more in a series game since Edwin Jackson of St. Louis in Game 4 of 2011. Glasnow went to three-ball counts on 12 of 23 batters.Los Angeles expanded its lead to 4-1 in the fifth, when Cash left Glasnow in to face left-handed-hitting Max Muncy with runners at the corners. Muncy hit a one-hopper to first baseman Yandy DÃ­az with the infield in, and Betts beat a strong but slightly offline throw with a headfirst slide past catcher Mike Zunino.Will Smith finished Glasnow with an RBI single, and Chris Taylor and pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez followed with run-scoring singles off Ryan Yarbrough for a 6-1 lead.Justin Turner and Muncy doubled on consecutive pitches in the sixth.Pinch-hitter Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs in the seventh against Victor Gonzalez, who snagged Zunino's line drive and doubled Brosseau off second base for an inning-ending double play.After a regular season played without fans, MLB resumed selling tickets with a limited amount for the NLCS at Globe Life and kept that up by allowing about 28 percent of capacity to be filled at the 40,518-seat ballpark, where the roof was open. The crowd was widely dispersed throughout and was the smallest for the Series since 10,535 attended Game 6 between the Pirates and Tigers at Detroit's Bennett Park in 1909, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.An overwhelming majority of fans wore Dodger blue."They're everywhere.

According to ESPN, Bjorkgren signed a multi-year deal with the Pacers.Bjorkgren, 45, was the assistant under Nick Nurse, named the NBA Coach of the Year last season in the Toronto Raptors. He also had years of experience coach NBA D-League teams."We are very pleased and excited to have Nate as our new coach. This was an extensive and thorough search, and when we reached the conclusion, we felt strongly Nate is the right coach for us at the right time. He comes from a winning background, has experienced championship success, is innovative, and his communication skills, along with his positivity, are tremendous. We all look forward to a long, successful partnership in helping the Pacers move forward," said Kevin Pritchard, president of basketball operations of the Pacers, in a statement."I am honored to take on the role as head coach of the Indiana Pacers. This is something I have prepared for during my career. I want to thank Kevin, Chad (Buchanan), Kelly (Krauskopf), Larry Bird, Donnie Walsh, and Herb and Steve Simon for this opportunity. I also want to thank Nick Nurse for giving me my first professional coaching job 14 years ago. I'm looking forward to working with this great team to achieve our goal as NBA Champions."Bjorkgren's creative thinking began to draw attention after he suggested Nurse use "Box-1 defense" on Stephen Curry in Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the Raptors and the Golden State Warriors last year. The ingenious move worked as Curry failed to even take one attempt in the last quarter of G2. In the end, the Raptors defeated the Warriors 4-2 to win their first NBA Championship in franchise history.Of course, that does not mean Bjokgren's new job will be easy at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Pacers made the NBA playoffs for the fifth straight time in the past 2019-20 season and were eliminated for the fifth time in a row. Moreover, they were swept out in both 2019 and 2020.The Pacers wanted breakthroughs, and they were capable of getting it if they were healthy â injuries had been haunting the team for years. Meanwhile, Bjorkgren may have a better chance of leading the Pacers to achieve a breakthrough if he can help Victor Oladipo find the best himself back. The 28-year-old two-time All-Star guard still has one year left of his contract with the deal, and he already rejected the four-year, 80-million-U.S.-dollar contract extension offer by the Pacers. If he can fully recover from injury and reproduces his incredible performance two years ago in the new season, it will benefit both himself and the Pacers.The Indiana Pacers have appointed Nate Bjorkgren as their new head coach, announced the team on Tuesday.

The English top league was said to have five candidates and it's unclear which of the "Big 6" will be left behind.Kleinman said that the financiers are trying to raise a $6 billion funding package and are negotiating with JP Morgan.

Its games will take place during the seasons of other national leagues and each team will play at least 30 games on a format of round-robin home and away fixtures.

rule violation after a World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal dismissed charges brought against her for registering four "whereabouts failures."The 22-year-old, who won gold at the World Championships in Doha last year, was charged and provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) in June.According to World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules, any combination of three whereabouts failures â filing failures or missed tests â within a 12-month period by an athlete constitutes an anti-doping violation.Athletes guilty of whereabouts failures could face two-year bans or a minimum of one year depending on the degree of fault.In Naser's case, the disciplinary tribunal upheld three of the four AIU charges against her â a filing failure effective Jan. 1, 2019 and two missed tests, on March 12 last year and January 24 this year.However, the tribunal found in Naser's favor with regard to a third alleged missed test on April 12, 2019, which resulted in the charges being dismissed because her three whereabouts failures did not occur within a 12-month rolling period."This was a case very much on the borderline and we hope the athlete will learn from the experience and heed the

Weihai, east China's Shandong Province, between November 8 and 10.This rule change is no good news for China, which sent Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha to attend the event. Chen and Sun are the No. 1 and No. 3 seeds based on their current world rankings. Meanwhile, China's biggest rival Mima Ito from Japan, is the No. 2 seed. That means Chen and Ito will be in different divisions, but there's no telling which division Sun will end in.If Chen and Sun meet before the final match, one of them has to go, and that will be in Ito's favor. Both Chen and Sun hold an advantageous record over Ito in the past competitions. The last time Chen met Ito happened at the Qatar Open in March. Chen came back from a 1-0 trail and defeated Ito 4-1 in the women's singles final match, winning the gold and claiming her fourth straight victory over Ito.Sun does not fear Ito either. She achieved a 3-2 win over Ito, coming back from a 2-0 trail at the ITTF Team World Cu last year. Sun also beat Ito 4-1 in the ITTF German Open in last October. Ito even shed tears after the loss.All three will make their singles World Cup debut in November, and each of them is eying for the first tile of the event in her career.

As the event is the first since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, the coach said the squad is focusing on their weaknesses, including by increasing strength training. "We work on the weakness or weak events, such as vault or floor exercise, everything will not happen overnight, but the team works hard together every day."Reflecting on his coaching accomplishments around the world, the 52-year-old said he enjoyed coming back to China and was honored to have a chance to guide the Chinese women's squad. "This great team has a lot of good traditions, we just have to keep building on physical ability."The Beijing native also shared several aspects of his approach to coaching. "I think there is no magic word to any sport," the World Cup winner said. "The hard work has to be done every single day. I think the hard part is keeping the athletes healthy, and also enjoying their hard work. I think that's the art of coaching."Coach Qiao is also looking to help the women's squad earn medals for China.

Deng finished the climb in 6.987 seconds, but Niu was even faster to reach the summit in 6.819 seconds. Both beat the world record (7.088 seconds) for women's speed climbing set by Aries Susanti Rahayu from Indonesia. However, since there were no officials from the International Federation of Sport Climbing to monitor the event because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the performance of Niu will not be recognized as a new world record.At the beginning of this month, snooker legend Stephen Hendry came out of retirement after eight years and accepted an invitational tour card to compete on the World Snooker Tour for at least the next two seasons. Previously, the seven-time world champion, who is nicknamed "King of Crucible" and "Emperor of Snooker," spoke to Sports Scene's Wang Dong.The 51-year-old retired in 2012, having slipped out of the World Championship at the quarter-final stage, and also making a 147 break in the event that year. Hendry felt that he might have played longer, but he left public because he wasn't playing well enough to win. "For me, the whole pleasure of playing snooker is to win, when I didn't have the success, I didn't enjoy that much," Hendry said in the interview.Even though the Scot has been away from playing on the main circuit, he has remained around the game as his passion remains in the sport. He's working as a commentator and ambassador for snooker around the world, especially in China. He emphasized that China is one of his favorite places and a big part of his career. He also gave thanks to all his Chinese fans for their support, saying he was flattered by the nickname "Emperor of Snooker."Hendry returned as a player on the 2020 World Seniors Snooker Championship in August, and a link-up with renowned coach Stephen Feeney has spurred him on to have another crack at the main tour. After receiving the invitational tour card, his return seems more realizable this time.When asked his assessment of current players, the snooker legend praised Ding Junhui, who is considered the most successful Asian player in history. "Ding and O'Sullivan have the best cue ball control", the Scot said. "I love Ding as a player, his game is incredible. He should have already won the World Championship because he has everything in his game, but I question if he has the hunger."He also shared his thoughts about Ronnie O'Sullivan's record-breaking success over him. "I wouldn't be happy, I have to be honest if Ronnie broke my record, but he still has to win another two," Hendry said of "The Rocket." The 44-year-old regained the title in Sheffield and is now only one behind Hendry's record seven world titles.Yan Xiaonan is one of the only two ranked Chinese female mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). She currently ranks 10th under the dominance of UFC women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili and, next month at UFC 253, Yan will face Claudia Gadelha from Brazil, with a victory likely to earn her a championship ticket.To earn her #10 position, the 31-year-old beat Poland's Karolina Kowalkiewicz by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night Auckland on February 23 this year.Yan's half-year-older opponent Gadelha comes into the fight on a shorter break, having just won her last fight against Angela Hill by split decision on May 16 at UFC Fight Night in Jacksonville, Florida.'Zhang didn't submit Jedrzejczyk, and I want to achieve that'Yan Xiaonan was the first female Chinese fighter to enter the Octagon. She signed a four-match contact with the UFC and had her first fight on November 25, 2017 at Fight Night Shanghai, eight months before current women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili.During the past four years, Yan has bagged five unanimous decision wins over Kailin Curran, Viviane Pereira, Syuri Kondo, Angela Hill, and Karolina Kowalkiewicz; Zhang also has five wins in this time, but with two submissions and one split decision. Yan's current record is significantly slimmer than that of Zhang, however. Yan is currently on 12-1 with one no contest, while Zhang is 21-1 and undefeated in her last 20. Both of them have a knock out (KO) rate of around 45 percent, but Yan's style has been more focused on striking in recent years.If Yan wins this fight, she would be a championship contender and could take part in the first UFC "China Derby" with Zhang.When asked about whom she'd like to fight the most, Yan said it's Joanna Jedrzejczyk: "Zhang Weili didn't submit her, and I want to achieve that."The fight between Zhang and Joanna is already considered the best female fight in MMA history by many. Zhang won a split decision after five fierce rounds against Joanna and, ever since that incredible victory, Zhang has become a superstar in China. Zhang and Yan both have sanda backgrounds, but when asked about their difference, Yan showed a smile and said, "Zhang's figure is more like Gadelha, and I'm taller.""For Zhang's next fight, which is probably to be made with Rose Namajunas, I think Zhang will win as Rose is not as strong as Jedrzejczyk. And if I win my fight with Gadelha, I think the China Derby will happen soon," Yan said when asked about what she expects from her future.Zhang is already an active champion, but she can't rest on her laurels with another Chinese contender rising through the ranks. Yan said, "I'm well prepared any time, but only if Dana White gives me an opportunity."'Gadelha is a BJJ black belt, I'm striking level 10'Yan Xiaonan passed a 14-day quarantine after coming back from Auckland and has trained consistently since. About the fight against Gadelha, she feels very confident, "I met her twice when I was training in Las Vegas, and I've also watched many videos of her fights. I know her very well." "My Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) coach is from Brazil, and he'd always like me to fight against her, so, we're preparing everything well, especially the strategy that my BJJ coach set for me," Yan added.Yan's coach Ruy Menezes is one of the first generation of BJJ practitioners in China. He got a black belt from the Gracie Family in 2002 and came to China for the first time in the following year. Ruy began to teach Jiu-Jitsu in Beijing in 2009, and he trained China's first UFC fighter Zhang Tiequan, as well as Li Jiangliang, Yan Xiaonan, and many other mixed martial artists.But due to the pandemic of COVID-19, he has been staying in Brazil and may not go to the UFC 253 to be the cornerman for Yan."Recently, my conditioning coach has trained me a lot on my explosive power and one-punch KO ability, but my head coach told me the most important thing is to win the whole match," Yan said."Gadelha is BJJ black belt, much higher than me, and she will definitely try to drag me to the canvas since the very beginning, but people said my standing skills are 'level 10'," the former professional sanda athlete said with a laugh."Gadelha has very good stamina and defence, she'd never been submitted, even after facing Jedrzejczyk twice. For this fight, I'll still focus on the entirety of match, as well try to find a KO opportunity, I believe I can do it."'Usually I'm quiet, but "Fury" in the Octagon'Yan said she's very excited about having the chance to fight a top-10 fighter but also worried about her team's safety due to traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The host venue for the fight has not been decided yet but probably in the Fight Island, but her team was asked to go to the United States next week, then go to Abu Dhabi from there by UFC private flight. They won't quarantine in the U.S."The condition out of China is worse than here, but professional sports are like this, athletes cannot take long rests, and my life has to go ahead," Yan said in a matter-of-fact way.Compared with Zhang, Yan is much less outgoing. She speaks simply, but that doesn't mean she isn't confident: "Every athlete trains to become the champion, if I don't want to be the champion, I wouldn't be an athlete."At the end of the interview, Yan was asked which of her nicknames she likes the most, and she said it's "Fury" and explained, "Usually, I'm quiet and do not like speak, but when I get into training and stand in the Octagon, I'm crazy, like being injected with chicken blood (Chinese proverb about getting invigorated). I just love the stage!"Yan Xiaonan is one of the only two ranked Chinese female mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). She currently ranks 10th under the dominance of UFC women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili and, next month at UFC 253, Yan will face Claudia Gadelha from Brazil, with a victory likely to earn her a championship ticket.To earn her #10 position, the 31-year-old beat Poland's Karolina Kowalkiewicz by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night Auckland on February 23 this year.Yan's half-year-older opponent Gadelha comes into the fight on a shorter break, having just won her last fight against Angela Hill by split decision on May 16 at UFC Fight Night in Jacksonville, Florida.'Zhang didn't submit Jedrzejczyk, and I want to achieve that'Yan Xiaonan was the first female Chinese fighter to enter the Octagon. She signed a four-match contact with the UFC and had her first fight on November 25, 2017 at Fight Night Shanghai, eight months before current women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili.During the past four years, Yan has bagged five unanimous decision wins over Kailin Curran, Viviane Pereira, Syuri Kondo, Angela Hill, and Karolina Kowalkiewicz; Zhang also has five wins in this time, but with two submissions and one split decision. Yan's current record is significantly slimmer than that of Zhang, however. Yan is currently on 12-1 with one no contest, while Zhang is 21-1 and undefeated in her last 20. Both of them have a knock out (KO) rate of around 45 percent, but Yan's style has been more focused on striking in recent years.If Yan wins this fight, she would be a championship contender and could take part in the first UFC "China Derby" with Zhang.When asked about whom she'd like to fight the most, Yan said it's Joanna Jedrzejczyk: "Zhang Weili didn't submit her, and I want to achieve that."The fight between Zhang and Joanna is already considered the best female fight in MMA history by many. Zhang won a split decision after five fierce rounds against Joanna and, ever since that incredible victory, Zhang has become a superstar in China. Zhang and Yan both have sanda backgrounds, but when asked about their difference, Yan showed a smile and said, "Zhang's figure is more like Gadelha, and I'm taller.""For Zhang's next fight, which is probably to be made with Rose Namajunas, I think Zhang will win as Rose is not as strong as Jedrzejczyk. And if I win my fight with Gadelha, I think the China Derby will happen soon," Yan said when asked about what she expects from her future.Zhang is already an active champion, but she can't rest on her laurels with another Chinese contender rising through the ranks.

I just love the stage!"After a shutdown of exactly five months due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) restarted on the afternoon of June 20. But, like most of the other recently rebooted professional sports leagues in the world, there was no audience at the venue â even the cheerleaders could only perform via an LED screen beside the court.Around two million messages were left by the audience on the Tencent Sports app during their livestream of the game between the Nanjing Monkey Kings and Zhejiang Lions showing people were excited for the return of basketball, but the two on-site commentators still had to ask each other "do you feel excited?" and try to create a positive vibe in the otherwise silent arena.On one hand, playing games behind closed doors is disappointing for fans who wanted to see the game live in the area, but on the other, the situation has led to the CBA regularly broadcasting their games in virtual reality (VR) â like what the NBA has been doing since 2014 â giving the home audience an immersive experience.By cooperating with China Mobile's Migu Video, the CBA lets the audience watch game live in VR, either on their smartphones or with a special headset, from different angles provided by 16 camera stands. The technology also allows fans to show their broadcast themselves in real-time on courtside screens.At the moment, it is easy for a league to broadcast live games in VR, but the penetration of VR devices in the target audiences is still low around the world due to reasons such as the high expense and often inconvenient user experience.Nevertheless, if holding live events behind closed doors becomes a common practice in the post-pandemic age â a period which may last for a relatively long time â will the large-scale application of 5G technology and the live streaming industry's boom on digital platforms combine to make virtual viewing a major component of modern sports?Traditional sports becoming eSportsDuring the pandemic, the world's major professional sports leagues had to pause, and so sports TV channels could only broadcast old games and events. Because of this, livestreams of eSport equivalents became a realistic alternative for fans.Because sports evolved from games, many video games can simulate real sports to a high degree, and some of them also have eSports leagues, like EA Sports' FIFA series, which is a yearly must-buy for a lot of gamers.In fact, some of the more expensive sports, have already been using simulators for a long while. Formula One (F1) is a major example of this, and as racing â in terms of both simulation and arcade styles â is a major genre of video games, F1 games are easily accepted by diehard fans and a wider audience too.F1 Virtual Grand Prix launched an official global league in 2017 and, during the pandemic, many F1 racers joined to stay busy but also keep their skills sharp. And by competing online, many developed closer bonds with their fans.According to an article released by the Ministry of Sports on June 22, F1 Virtual Grand Prix eSports series eclipsed 30 million views on TV and digital platforms combined during the COVID-19 lockdown.The number evidently cannot compete with the trillions of cumulative viewers for the real F1 Grand Prix series in 2019, but it's still a significant result for eSports.Basketball game NBA 2K got a peak number of around 14,000 simultaneous viewers in a live competition which was held with real NBA stars on March 31. FIBA used this as the basis for setting up the international FIBA eSports Open 2020 which was held for the first time ever from June 19 to 21.While it is true that it is becoming more popular for professional leagues to move their offline contests online, when sports lose their physicality, to a large extent, they also lose their essence.Smart sports equipmentMost sports events and exercises must be played with specific equipment, and currently, more and more fitness equipment, whether found in professional gyms or at home, can be combined with video games, like some treadmill and spinning bikes that connect with screens and turn users' workout data into virtual scenes.To get in on the trend, some video game developers are also creating motion sensing peripherals to push their players into getting physical.To give a recent example, Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventure on the Switch platform has become a smash hit during the pandemic, as people can use its ring-shaped peripheral to play a game and keep fit at the same time.Combining exercise with video games dates back to expensive American gyms in the 1980s. But now, motion sensing apps for yoga, dancing, running, cycling and other solo exercises are very common worldwide.However, on an industry-wide level, as sports are all about being "Faster, Higher, Stronger" and differ from exercise by being based in competition and confrontation, to create authentic experiences, sports game developers should consider creating products that allow people to do head-to-head or team sports in small, isolated spaces.Playing sports with X-realityIn the world of Steven Spielberg's 2018 movie "Ready Player One", people from all around the world can use custom avatars to play with and against each other in the same virtual world by using wearable technology.To a certain degree at present, that is already possible: people can walk on omni-direction treadmills or be suspended in midair on wires to expand their active range in a virtual world, and also some helmet or armor-like clothing can let you feel vibrations, heat and wind.This method of playing sports fits the post-pandemic age, but at the moment, it can only be realized in large, public areas such as the shopping malls, arcades and amusement parks due to the size and cost of the equipment.But, even if this were to become readily accessible on a consumer level, it still raises a question: Are gamers satisfied with just simulating traditional sports?A Japanese company has created an innovative team game called HADO with augmented reality (AR) technology. Through the headset's screen, players can see a game world and their human opponents at the same time, and by doing gestures while wearing the arm sensor, players can perform attacking and defensive moves with virtual fireballs and shields.During the pandemic, HADO launched a new project called HADO Xball, which is like a reality show happening behind closed doors. Inspired by Asian hip-hop culture, the players move around like dancers or stuntmen on the set of a martial arts movie and the audience, watching the livestreams from anywhere, can give energy to their favorite players by shaking their phone, increases the interactivity between users and making the impact of "the twelfth man" more direct than ever possible in real world sports.The potential of X-reality is huge, and the market is burgeoning too as the technology is already used in some areas to improve productivity, and many electronic equipment manufacturers such as Apple intend to put AR glasses on sale in the next few years.Chinese mobile company Huawei also launched a cross platform real time Kung Fu game experience powered by Huawei 5G. In the advertisement video, a Kung Fu master equipped with all kinds of sensors remotely fights head-to-head with an eSports gamer.As the slogan of Huawei 5G Kung Fu Showdown is "The pain feels real in 5G," perhaps one day soon, people can get the feeling of playing real sports in the virtual world.(Cover photo designed by Li Chenqi)Zheng Guohua is a 17-year-old middle-distance runner from Tumed Left Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. For the past four years, she has been coached by her father Zheng Long.Father and daughter get up at 4 a.m. every day to train on the road. Dad rides a motorbike and wears flashlights to light up his daughter's predawn route.Because he wants her to maintain her physical condition during the bitter winter months, Long came up with the ingenious idea of building a "home gym" â from discarded items such as used tires and wire.She is very thankful for what her father has done for her.When she's tired of training, she seeks inspiration from his motto, "You can get superman rewards only by making superman efforts."Guohua has won a lot of races and has a best time of 2:28 in the 800 meters â an improvement of 33 seconds over the last three years.Father and daughter have also raised over 6,000 yuan by selling bricks that they picked up on the street. The family, which has a monthly income of just 4,000 yuan, sent all of it to a local charity during the COVID-19 pandemic.(Video Editor: Li Chenqi)Wasps will play in the Gallagher Premiership final against newly-crowned European champions Exeter Chiefs, Premiership Rugby announced on Wednesday.The announcement came after the club received no additional positive cases in the latest round of Covid-19 testing."Everyone at Premiership Rugby is delighted to confirm Wasps' place in the Final after the latest round of tests as part of our PCR COVID-19 screening programme," a statement from Premiership Rugby read in part.Wasps' participation was in serious doubt after the club confirmed four more positive tests on Monday, in addition to the seven reported last Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 11.This means that Challenge Cup winners Bristol Bears, who were comprehensively defeated by Wasps in the semi-final nearly two weeks ago, will not have to replace them in the game.Wasps group chief executive Stephen Vaughan thanked Rugby Football Union (RFU), Premiership Rugby and Public Health England officials for their "clarity and assistance" throughout the entire process."As a club, we are delighted that we can now take our rightful place in this Saturday's Premiership Rugby final. To all of our fans and well-wishers, thank you for your many messages of support, this final is for you."The Premiership final, which will be a rematch of the 2017 final won by Exeter, is set to take place on Saturday, October 24, at Twickenham.(With input from agencies)Wasps will play in the Gallagher Premiership final against newly-crowned European champions Exeter Chiefs, Premiership Rugby announced on Wednesday.The announcement came after the club received no additional positive cases in the latest round of Covid-19 testing."Everyone at Premiership Rugby is delighted to confirm Wasps' place in the Final after the latest round of tests as part of our PCR COVID-19 screening programme," a statement from Premiership Rugby read in part.Wasps' participation was in serious doubt after the club confirmed four more positive tests on Monday, in addition to the seven reported last Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 11.This means that Challenge Cup winners Bristol Bears, who were comprehensively defeated by Wasps in the semi-final nearly two weeks ago, will not have to replace them in the game.Wasps group chief executive Stephen Vaughan thanked Rugby Football Union (RFU), Premiership Rugby and Public Health England officials for their "clarity and assistance" throughout the entire process."As a club, we are delighted that we can now take our rightful place in this Saturday's Premiership Rugby final.

The game against Paris Saint-Germain wasn't smooth sailing yet even a loss wouldn't have tainted their reputation as clearly being the best club team in Europe as they had steamrolled everyone on their way to the final, including the now infamous 8-2 mauling of FC Barcelona.When Hans-Dieter "Hansi" Flick was appointed as Bayern manager on November 3, 2019, a "new manager bounce" was expected. After all, the side had been floundering under Niko Kovac, so the only way could be up; what nobody really expected was for Bayern to bounce up into the stratosphere.Since Flick arrived last year, the team have won 39 games, lost only three times and drawn exactly once, and the Champions League victory joined a romp through the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal (German league cup) to bring the team a historic treble.Flick's aggressive style of play and the overall team consistency made Bayern look like they would rule the roost for years to come, and normally they would, but this is 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned football on its head and, for Bayern, that has played out in a heavily foreshortened season.There was less than a month between their Champions League win last season and the start of this new one and Bayern Munich's fatigue has showed, most notably in a shock 4-1 loss to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim on September 27. Not only that but last week, the team had two games in 48 hours: a DFB-Pokal game on October 15 and then a Bundesliga game on October 17.This would be fine if Flick had a squad he could rotate through but this summer's transfer window has sapped the Bayern bench. The main loss is midfield maestro Thiago who has moved to Liverpool. Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho returning to their home clubs doesn't help in that area either, especially when the big signings â Leroy Sane, Douglas Costa, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting â are all attackers. Plus, Serge Gnabry, the team's second highest scorer behind Robert Lewandowski last year, has been ruled out of the game due to testing positive for COVID-19.This puts Bayern at a severe disadvantage in tonight's game against Atletico Madrid; not because of the type of weakness but simply because it is a weakness. If there's one manager in all of football who loves to exploit the flaws of opponents, it's the cruel and callous Diego Simeone.Atletico's previous Champions League campaign shows how tactically villainous he can be. Against defending champions Liverpool, once his team took the early lead in the first leg, Atletico played to maintain it by any means necessary. Ten men behind the ball, cynical fouls, possession for the sake of possession; his Atletico will do anything to grind out a result. And now, with the arrival of ex-Barcelona man Luis Suarez, Simeone has a player as notoriously black hearted as himself.After that sensational defeat of Liverpool, Atletico went on to lose to RB Leipzig in the knockout quarterfinals, demonstrating that their tactics are an all-or-nothing gamble. Against a massive side like Bayern Munich, it's a risk, but it could also be their key to victory.When Bayern Munich won last season's Champions League in August, it was something of an inevitability.

In the build up, Manchester United vs. Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) was considered a big game. The zillionaire champions of France vs. the resurgent English bronze medalists. The realpolitik on the night was very different: an empty stadium under a downpour on a chilly Parisian October night set the tone from the very beginning.Limp and lifeless, for the duration â but especially the early goings â this blockbuster fixture could have been passed off as a pre-season friendly. PSG manager Thomas Tuchel had an excuse as most of his star players were out with injuries. What can't be excused was how he seemingly did nothing to mitigate that on the field.PSG's formation is akin to an accordion. Playing in a 4-3-3 formation, that back four tend to stay rigid in front of their goalkeeper, becoming a back seven when necessary. Those three midfielders who dropped back then usually spring forward and push up the pitch to slightly beyond the halfway line where the front three of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel di Maria wait deep. They like to play with space; di Maria to fire in crosses, Neymar and Mbappe to use their incredible pace.This works when you have a full squad firing on both flanks. Without midfielders Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes out due to injury and Marquinhos, technically a center-back but a genuine box-to-box maverick, unavailable also, PSG had practically no service going forwards.To make matters worse, Manchester United looked like they had forgone the concept of formations altogether. Their 3-4-1-2 does leave plenty of space around Bruno Fernandes â the "1" â but their focus on overloading man-to-man defense created scenarios where Fernandes, Scott McTominay, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof and Axel Tuanzebe would smother Neymar and, in the process, leave roughly a third of the pitch for PSG to play in.This bizarre combination, played out a low-effort slow motion, eliminated almost all attacking link-up play so it's not a surprise that the first two goals came from dead ball scenarios and individual errors. In the 20th minute, Anthony Martial was fouled in the box by Abdou Diallo giving United a penalty. Fernandes took it with a hop, skip and a kick into the bottom right corner â only to have it saved by goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Navas, however, was off his line so it was taken again. Fernandes took it with a hop, skip and a kick into the bottom right corner and made it 1-0.Ten minutes into the second half, PSG got a corner and Neymar fired it into the United box. Martial, the closest to Neymar and completely unhurried by opponents, leapt up, closed his eyes and headed it into his own goal while badly trying to defend.At 1-1 and with half an hour left, the game began to look like a real match. Idrissa Gueye and Ander Herrera getting swapped out for Moise Kean and Rafinha lit a spark in PSG and they started to pose a genuine threat going forward; Manchester United's substitution of Alex Telles for Paul Pogba ended up being a game changer.As play opened up in the final stretch, Marcus Rashford found himself with acres of space around the PSG box and had several attempts on goal. The one trend that remained is that these were either individual efforts or clumsy attempts at link-up play. In both cases he was repeatedly snuffed out by Diallo and Presnel Kimpembe.As the clock ticked down and this agonizing display looked to be headed to a 1-1 draw, Pogba, who had been active from the moment he came on, played a short cross to Rashford who turned, ran into the gap between Danilo Pereira and Pablo Sarabia and smashed it diagonally into the bottom left corner.With only three minutes to go, Rashford won the game for United in Paris, just as he did one year ago with the extra time penalty that knocked PSG out of the 2018/19 tournament. Not an exciting or entertaining victory, but an important one for United nonetheless. With current Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig in the same group, Rashford's goal could be crucial in getting his side through to the knockouts.Context is important.

I will only take part in a tournament when I am 100% fit. "At the moment, it looks like I can make my comeback at the Australian Open in January."While he has made significant progress in his recovery, he said he is still not at the point where he can train as usual. "Not yet, more than two hours with the racket are not possible at the moment," said Federer, who is currently ranked fourth in the world and saw Rafa Nadal equal his Grand Slam haul with a 13th French Open title this month. "But I've been working on my stamina and strength absolutely without pain for a while. There will be no further operations."Federer is often asked about his retirement plans, but the Swiss said he would keep playing as long as he was enjoying it. "I have been thinking about ideas for about five years," he said. "But as long as I am having fun and it's right for all of us, I'll keep going."Roger Federer is practicing pain-free after undergoing two knee surgeries this year and says he expects to return to the circuit at the Australian Open in January. The 39-year-old Swiss reached the semifinals at Melbourne Park at the start of the year but missed the rest of the season after undergoing a second arthroscopic procedure on his right knee. "I'm on the right track," the 20 times Grand Slam singles champion told German-language magazine Schweizer Illustrierte. "I'm gradually coming back, but I'm going to take my time and don't want to put any pressure on myself.

It isn't just the date that's strange to see, so is the line-up for tonight's match day 1, which includes teams such as Istanbul Basaksehir from the Turkish Superlig, Rennes from France's Ligue 1 and Ferencvaros from Hungary's Nemezti Bajnoksag I (never heard of it either), all of whom are making their Champions League debut or return after decades away.The most reassuring sight is Manchester United of the English Premier League taking on perennial Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Both veterans of the Champions League, the sides have only ever faced each other once before in the tournament: in the 2018/19 season, PSG won the first leg 2-0 then lost the second to United 3-1.Manchester United's qualification for this Champions League campaign was practically decided in the final game of the season. Having spent the 2019 portion of the Premier League balancing wins, losses and draws, the Red Devils went unbeaten from February 1 onwards, eking their way up the table to third place. They also put together a commendable run in the Europa League, where they got knocked out in the semifinal by eventual winners Sevilla.PSG on the other hand have become a perennial competitor in the Champions League ever since they got taken over by the Qatar Sports Investment group. They reached the final of the foreshortened 2019/20 season but were beaten by Bayern Munich.Typically, the finalists should be the favorites when going up against a team that came up from the Europa League, however the manner in which PSG so recently lost could make Manchester United think their opponents are there for the taking. Les Parisiens spent most of the second half acting bratty, playing for fouls and, when they did concede, very clearly mentally crumbled.Not only are they unlikely to have built mental fortitude in barely eight weeks, manager Thomas Tuchel has said he has just 11 healthy players. While he will be pleased that his strike team of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar are fighting fit, confirmed out of this game are regular starters Juan Bernat, Mauro Icardi, Thilo Kehrer, Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes and Julian Draxler, Marquinhos and Danilo Pereira are expected to start on the bench.Another player missing from the PSG squad is Edinson Cavani, who transferred to Manchester United in the summer transfer window. While he has recently been dealing with his COVID-19 quarantine and not part of the squad in France, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also missing captain Harry Maguire, Marcus Rojo and Phil Jones from his standard line up.This would suggest United go into this as the favorites, but their record in the 2020/21 Premier League season has been appalling. A 3-1 loss to Crystal Palace and a spectacular 6-1 capitulation to Tottenham Hotspur sandwich a 3-2 win over Brighton, a game that officially ended 2-2. The referee then decided to restart it because of a VAR decision and award Manchester a penalty officially listed as taking place 10 minutes into added time. Only their 4-1 win over Newcastle last week counts as anything genuinely positive.PSG, whose season started with four games in 10 days, began with two shock losses to Lens and Marseille but have since righted the ship and won the following five by an aggregate of 16-1. The momentum is on their side and if they can put together a team of second stringers to go alongside their world class forwards, they should be able to handle Manchester United, but if United truly give it their best, they could force PSG to break.(Cover image: PSG's Kylian Mbappe and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford during their Champions League game at the Parc des Princes, Paris, France, March 7, 2019. /Getty)Not even two whole months since last season's final in Lisbon, the UEFA Champions League is back.

The new campaign has started and Bayi's opening game against the Beijing Ducks descended into chaos as they failed to turn up, with Beijing Ducks later being declared the winners in a 20-0 forfeit. It still remains to be seen how the CBA will revise its fixture schedule after the official withdrawal of Bayi.The Chinese Basketball Association has confirmed that both the men's and women's team of Bayi Rockets would pull out of the country's professional leagues, ending weeks of speculation over the Nanchang-based giants' future. The CBA recognized Bayi's "indelible contribution to the development of the Chinese basketball" in a public statement on Tuesday, pointing out that their men's and women's sides have managed to "nurture quality players for the national team on a regular basis." Bayi, whose name refers to the date of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1927, have been one of the dominant forces in Chinese basketball, winning the CBA eight times since joining the league in 1995. But the once-mighty side gradually plunged into mediocrity after sticking to their tradition of recruiting only Chinese players under a tight budget, while rival teams took advantage of the commercialization of the CBA to make huge investments on high-profile stars and coaches. Bayi hit rock bottom last season after suffering a 13-game losing streak and eventually finished at the foot of the table.

Retrospective punishment can only be considered if an incident was not seen at the time. The verdict has raised further controversy about the decision on the day made by referee Michael Oliver and video assistant referee (VAR) David Coote."Pickford on Van Dijk is a clear challenge that endangers a player with excessive force and should have been deemed a sending-off. A red card should have been issued," former Premier League referee Mark Halsey told BBC. "Why it got missed only the PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Board) can tell us that. It's amazing the statement has come out that they didn't recognize it as a red card, serious foul play challenge. I'm astonished," he added. The stance was supported by another former referee, Mark Clattenburg. "Michael Oliver should have been told to look at his monitor by VAR David Coote. Had Oliver done so, I'm sure he would have sent off Jordan Pickford for his challenge on Virgil van Dijk," he told Daily Mail."I've also heard it claimed Pickford could not be dismissed because Van Dijk was offside â rubbish. Oliver had not blown his whistle by the time Pickford lunged in, so he could still have been punished," he observed. "VAR confirming later Van Dijk was offside does not nullify a red. The bottom line is, Coote should have sent Oliver to his monitor. Given Van Dijk was injured, the referee had plenty of time to review the incident." Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was equally incensed, but his major concern right now is how to deal with Van Dijk's absence."A few things are clear, so he now will be out for a while, that's clear," said Klopp in a press briefing. "We don't want to set any timeframe, to be honest, because each player is different and each individual is different.""So we feel now in this moment extremely, extremely for him because most of us have been in a similar situation and we know that these situations are absolutely rubbish. You don't need it but you have to get over it and Virgil will get over it, 100%, and today is already the first day, if you want, of the recovery," he added. Former defender Jamie Carragher noted that Klopp's side must look to sign a replacement in the January transfer window. "The big question you're looking at now is, can Liverpool win the league without Van Dijk there? I think it blows the title race wide open," the veteran told Sky Sports. "Liverpool have to go into the market in January and not just because of Van Dijk's injury. They were weak in that area anyway.

No time frame has been put on his absence by the club but an injury of this nature could force him on the sidelines for several months and even miss the remainder of the campaign.In an Instagram post on Sunday night, the defender said: "I'm now fully focused on my recovery and will do everything I can to be back as quickly as possible. In football, as in life, I believe everything happens for a reason and it's important to try and keep level headed whether going through the highs and lows."According to Sky Sports, Pickford, who escaped a red card from the referee, attempted to make contact with Van Dijk but has yet to speak to him directly.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is yet to speak publicly about the huge blow of losing one of his most reliable players but he questioned why no action was taken against Pickford during his post-game press conference on Saturday."For me it was a clear penalty that I saw. Then obviously we saw the flag went up, so offside. I still thought it was worth a look on the foul but that didn't happen," said Klopp. "We have no power there, we just sit here and you discuss it with me. You have to ask other people about that, not me. What can I say?"Statistics from the BBC show that Van Dijk has missed just one Premier League game since joining Liverpool. He played all 38 Premier League games in 2018/19 as Liverpool conceded just 22 goals. In his 95 Premier League starts for Liverpool, they have conceded just 78 goals and kept 44 clean sheets.In 2019, he was awarded the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA)'s Player of the Year and also became the first defender to pick up UEFA's Player of the Year award.Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most severe injuries suffered by players and it requires a recovery period of six to nine months. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Manchester United career was effectively over after he picked up the ACL injury during their Europa League clash with Anderlecht in 2017.Zlatan's former United teammate Marcos Rojo and Borussia Dortmund talisman Marco Reus also endured the same season-ending injury, but both failed to rediscover their fine form after returning to action.Liverpool's worst fears were confirmed on Sunday as scans revealed that defender Virgil van Dijk had suffered anterior cruciate ligament damage in the Merseyside derby.The Netherlands captain, who has played an important role in Liverpool's title-winning seasons since his arrival from Southampton in January 2018, was injured by a horrible foul from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford just five minutes into the bad-tempered encounter at Goodison Park.Van Dijk had to be substituted and was later sent to hospital for a scan, which revealed he would require surgery.

In the second half, Zall's Song Zhiwei kicked the ball to one of Jianye's players when the game was stalled, almost causing strife. As a result, Song was given a yellow card.Later, Song also committed a foul on Dourado by kicking him down on the ground, but he got away with it. Zall's Eddy Gnahore broke into Jianye's box into Jianye's box and was taken down there in the 64th minute, but no foul was called.The two teams will meet again on October 23.'Shanghai Derby' ends 0-0The CSL defending champions Shanghai SIPG failed to win the "Shanghai Derby" against Shanghai Shenhua in the championship group. Neither side scored anything before the game ended a 0-0 tie.SIPG, as the stronger side, shot 19 times in the game and kept posing threats against Shenhua's goal in the last five minutes. However, Stephane M'Bia and goalkeeper Zeng Cheng managed to keep their net safe. Meanwhile, Li Shenglong, Fu Huan, and He Guan also missed several great scoring opportunities. Yang Xu's header in the 91st minute was only inches away from bringing SIPG a win.SIPG's starting goalkeeper Yan Junling collided with Shenhua's Bi Jinhao in the 36th minute. Yan's head was hit, and the game was paused for nine minutes before Yan was replaced by Chen Wei.Shenhua only tried two shots in the game, and neither of them was on the goal.Henan Jianye edged over Wuhan Zall 1-0 in their first game in the relegation group on Sunday, gaining the upper hand in the competition for the right to stay in the Chinese Super League.Henrique Dourado scored the game-winning goal via a penalty kick for Jianye in the 30th minute after Christian Bassogog created the chance for him. Though he did not score the goal himself, Bassogog gave himself an excellent present for his 25th birthday.This game was not as peaceful as its scoreboard. In the 9th minute, Zall's Liu Yi and Jianye's Fernando Karanga bumped into each other when they competed for a header. Both shed blood. Liu changed a new jersey and had to wear head protection. In the second half, Zall's Song Zhiwei kicked the ball to one of Jianye's players when the game was stalled, almost causing strife. As a result, Song was given a yellow card.Later, Song also committed a foul on Dourado by kicking him down on the ground, but he got away with it.

He believes this separates the UFC from other combat sports leagues, and from the world of contemporary boxing in particular, by keeping competition high and preventing fighters from getting padded resumes.For fans, this is a good thing. For fighters, less so â especially fighters in the position of Brian "T-City" Ortega. Ortega had an undefeated streak of 14-0 with one No Contest that lasted from 2010 to 2018. His loss to then-UFC men's featherweight champion Max Holloway at UFC 231 on December 8, 2018, was due to a doctor's stoppage. It was an anticlimactic end to his hot streak, not so much because of the loss itself, but because it would be the last round Ortega would fight for almost two years.Ortega took almost a year to recuperate from his injuries. During that time, he got into a heated rivalry with Jung Chan-sung, better known to MMA fans as The Korean Zombie (TKZ). Even though it was revealed that it was orchestrated by TKZ's translator Jay Park, it drew a lot of attention, and a fight was signed for UFC Fight Night: Busan on December 21, 2019.An ACL tear forced Ortega to pull out on December 4. That should have been the end of the feud: The trash talk had been revealed to be a put-on, and Ortega was out of action. However, several days later, in an ESPN interview, TKZ said he thought Ortega was ducking him.Certain people in MMA don't take kindly to that sort of banter. Conor McGregor found out the hard way with Khabib Nurmagomedov in the cage, Leon Edwards found out with Jorge Masvidal backstage at UFC Fight Night London, and Jay Park found out when Ortega walked up to him in the crowd and slapped him at UFC 248 on March 7 this year. The hype was now real, and there could only be one fight for Ortega's return.That fight took place at UFC Fight Island 6 on October 18, 2020. After almost two years on the shelf, and with a point to prove, all eyes were on Ortega. The two men are known as brawlers, so it was expected that Ortega would start fast. Instead, Round 1 was almost entirely a feeling out process with Ortega using his jab to set up harder strikes that found their target later into the round.The chess match ended a minute into Round 2 when TKZ sprinted over and tried punch combinations on Ortega's chin. Ortega said he wanted to be "unrecognizable" in this fight, and he showed it. Instead of being drawn into a slugfest, he maintained his composure and built on the jab and jab feints of Round 1 with takedown attempts and feints. TKZ, usually a bulldozer, now looked timid, unsure when to pull the trigger to avoid caught in Ortega's excellent jiujitsu. With barely 60 seconds remaining, he reverted to type and tried another bullrush, only to find himself on the receiving end of a pinpoint reverse elbow.TKZ survived the round, and the remainder of the fight proved "Zombie" isn't just a nickname. It was given to Chan because he's notoriously resilient, but following that second round elbow, he really became dead inside. Even when he had Ortega pinned against the cage, his head was still, and his feet were flat.From there, the only differences in rounds 3, 4 and 5 were how much damage Ortega inflicted on TKZ and how far ahead of him he pulled in terms of points. TKZ only wanted to apply pressure and swing for the fences. Meanwhile, Ortega mixed all his skills to run rings around TKZ and pulverize him. In Round 3, he chased TKZ across the Octagon, hunting for a takedown, only to release when he was expected to pull down and instead cut TKZ open with a punishing right hook.In the final round, TKZ was so confused by Ortega's offense that he found himself getting hit by simple right and left straights. When the final bell rang, it was no surprise that Ortega won by unanimous decision (50-45, 50-45, 50-45). What was surprising was how good Ortega was. It didn't matter that he didn't get a tune-up fight; he didn't need one. He hasn't been gone for 22 months, he's been preparing for 22 months, and now he's better than ever.One thing UFC president Dana White is particularly proud of is ensuring nobody in his organization gets a "tune-up" fight.

Sichuan rookie Zhu Songwei went 1-7 from the field to finish with five points in 20 minutes.After another newbie, Zheng Qilong of the Jiangsu Dragons, scored 20 points in Saturday's season opener, many expected Zhu to have a similar performance. Zhu, 23, averaged 19.6 points and 7.6 rebounds in the Chinese University Basketball Association and had been nicknamed the "Kevin Durant of Shantou University."However, the CBA is a different world. Hu missed six shots, over half of which were wide open. He also committed four fouls and when he was on the court, Sichuan was the losing side. One game could never define Zhu's career but it's a reminder he needs to work harder to adapt to the league.Shenzhen established a safe lead from the beginning with a 15-2 run. Sichuan managed to slim the deficit to single digits more than once but their defense lacked consistency. After the first quarter, Shenzhen finished every quarter leading by 10+ points before taking the win.Dai Huaibo leads Jilin over NanjingThe Jilin Northeast Tigers beat the Nanjing Monkey Kings 105-97 on Sunday. Though Jilin's Jiang Yuxing fouled out early in the fourth quarter, Dai Huaibo carried the team on his shoulders by dropping a game-high 27 points. Dai's constant attack on Nanjing's paint helped Jilin lead 29-10 in free throw attempts.Having missed the playoffs last season, Nanjing went through great changes during the offseason. They hired a new general manager, Huo Nan, appointed a new head coach, Zvjezdan Misimovic, and landed 13 new players.Nanjing saw five of their players reach double-digit points but the team also turned the ball over 21 times, giving Jilin too many opportunities for easy points via fast break. Meanwhile, the 31 fouls they committed also meant Nanjing's players need to get more familiar with each other defensively.Beijing pockets win for Bayi's absenceThe Bayi Rockets, who were scheduled to play the Beijing Ducks on Sunday, did not show up in the arena. Therefore, Beijing was awarded a 20-0 win. There's no official announcement whether Bayi will continue to miss the rest of their games this season.Wang Zhelin is outnumbered by ShanxiThe Shanxi Loongs defeated the Fujian Sturgeons 99-92. Though Fujian's ace center Wang Zhelin put down 32 points and 18 rebounds, both game highs, he could not carry his team to victory alone.Despite Wang's incredible performance, Fujian only saw three of their players reach double-digit points â Huang Yichao (13) and Xu Mingzhi (11). The team's other ace, Chen Linjian, was 1-6 in FGs to score only two points.By contrast, six of Shanxi's players reached double-digits in scoring. Zhou Zhandong had 12 points, four rebounds, nine assists and three steals. His orchestrating added great mobility to Shanxi's offense which Fujian found difficult to contain.In the last two games on Sunday night, the Zhejiang Lions pocketed a big win over the Shanghai Sharks. The Lions' star pair Sun Minghui and Hu Jinqiu together put down 72 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists.

The 23-year-old from Brooklyn became the unified lightweight champion and managed to do what few in boxing thought he could do â outbox perhaps the best technician in boxing.Lopez (16-0) added the three titles held by Lomachenko (15-2) to the belt he won last year to become the undisputed 135-champion.Lopez was favored 119-109, 117-111 and 116-112 on ringside scorecards in a bout held without fans at the MGM Grand conference center. The Associated Press had Lopez winning 117-111.Lopez proved faster and stronger than the 32-year-old Lomachenko, who won two Olympic gold medals as an amateur and was regarded as one of the top pound-for-pound fighters as a pro. Surprisingly enough, he was also the better boxer and proved he could close the show by bloodying Lomachenko's eye in the 12th round."I had to dig deep, man," Lopez said. "I'm a fighter, I've got to dig in deep."Lomachenko, ordinarily a slow starter, was too slow this time as he gave away rounds early as he tried to figure out the style of Lopez. By the time the fight got competitive in the eighth round he was too far behind to come back."He's been in a 14-month layoff," Lopez said. "I knew it was going to take him a long time to catch up."Lomachenko, who lost only once in nearly 400 amateur fights and had only one loss as a pro, thought he did better than the scorecards indicated."Definitely I am not agreeing with the scorecards," he said.The fight was the biggest since the pandemic began and would have been a pay-per-view event in normal times. But with no fans it was televised on ESPN, providing boxing with a bigger showcase than it would have gotten otherwise.Lomachenko was a 4-1 favorite but looked rusty early as he tried to solve the style of Lopez. He threw punches only sparingly the first half of the fight, landing just 31 punches in the first seven rounds, before finally picking up the pace in the eighth round."I think the first half of the fight he got more rounds than I did but in the second half of the fight I took over," Lomachenko said. "I was much better."Punch statistics showed Lopez landed 183 of 659 punches while Lomachenko was credited with 141 of 321. In the 12th round Lopez outlanded Lomachenko 50 to 19 and opened up a cut that sent blood flowing down his face and prompted referee Russell Mora to stop the fight with 10 seconds left to have the ring doctor look at it before resuming.Lopez was told by his father in the corner before the 12th round that he was ahead and not to risk anything. But he came out strong and beat Lomachenko to the punch."I didn't know if they had him up on the scorecards or not," Lopez said.Lopez did his trademark backflip in the ring after the unanimous decision was announced.Lopez became the youngest fighter to become a four-belt champion in only his second title fight. He had sought the fight against Lomachenko, angering the Ukrainian with his brash tactics."I love to fight and I can bang too," Lopez said.

agencies)China's women's national volleyball team captain and superstar spiker Zhu Ting will continue representing Tianjin Bohai Bank for the Chinese Volleyball Super League (CVL)'s new season as she showed up wearing her regular No. 5 jersey with the team at a pre-season charity match in Tianjin on Saturday.Having spearheaded the team for their 12th CVL title without conceding a single match last season, Zhu had listed Tianjin as her top choice for the upcoming new season, which is scheduled to take off in a tournament format in Jiangmen, southeast China's Guangdong Province on November

I look forward to my future cooperation with the team," said Zhu, who won her first domestic league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) with Tianjin last year.Before joining Tianjin last season, the 25-year-old Chinese spiker had an incredible ride at the Turkish women's volleyball club Vakifbank Istanbul for three seasons, sweeping a haul of trophies, including the esteemed FIVB Club World Championships and CEV Champions League. She pressed the pause button for her overseas journey last year, joining Tianjin Bohai Bank and playing at China's domestic volleyball league all for one goal in mind â 2020 Tokyo Olympics.That goal also plays a crucial factor in her choice to stay with the Tianjin team. The coaching staff Zhu works with at the Tianjin Bohai Bank, many of them are part of the national team's coaching squad. And some of Zhu's teammates at Team Tianjin, such as Yao Di and Li Yingying, are also national team players who will fight with Zhu in Tokyo.Lang Ping, the head coach of China's women's national volleyball team, has been considerate in giving advice upon Zhu's joining of Tianjin."Coach Lang told me to follow the team's instructions and finish training and all kinds of tasks as planned by the team. At the same time, I should go and communicate whenever I have sustained an injury," said Zhu."She also encouraged me to reach a level of communications with the team where we are familiar with each other's needs."Due to her right wrist's injury, Zhu has taken an eight-week-long break and thus missed out on the Chinese Women's Volleyball Championships which concluded earlier this month. Working on getting back on court, Zhu is optimistic about her recovery and has tremendous trust on the club's physiotherapist Daniel Wai Hong, who is also the therapist with the national team."I will gradually get back my form through each game and work with Daniel to make plans. He can really help me achieve many impossible tasks, and I think I will be fine," said Zhu.Tianjin Bohai Bank claimed league championship last season, and with Zhu, it is on course to their 13th league title. However, Zhu has set her vision beyond securing another domestic crown."Everything is for the Olympics, no matter it is the game or the training," said Zhu. "We need to work on our weaknesses through this domestic league competition as well as the training session leading up to the Olympics."(Cover image: Zhu Ting stand with teammates during a preseason charity volleyball game of the 2020-2021 Chinese Volleyball Super League in Tianjin, China, October 17, 2020. /VCG)China's women's national volleyball team captain and superstar spiker Zhu Ting will continue representing Tianjin Bohai Bank for the Chinese Volleyball Super League (CVL)'s new season as she showed up wearing her regular No. 5 jersey with the team at a pre-season charity match in Tianjin on Saturday.Having spearheaded the team for their 12th CVL title without conceding a single match last season, Zhu had listed Tianjin as her top choice for the upcoming new season, which is scheduled to take off in a tournament format in Jiangmen, southeast China's Guangdong Province on November 12. "Thanks to our last season's cooperation, I've developed really good relationships with my teammates as well as the club.

Everything I did was authorized."He is currently quarantined at his home in Turin after travelling from Portugal in an air ambulance. "I am continuing my quarantine, I am alone, my family is on another floor, we can't be in contact and it will be like that at least for the next 10 days," the 35-year-old added. Local health authorities in the Piedmont region said that prosecutors had been informed of the departure of Ronaldo and other Juve players to join their respective national teams while the Italian champions were in isolation following two COVID-19 cases among the team's non-playing staff. Juventus said on Thursday that Ronaldo, who claims to not have the "slightest symptom", returned to Italy in a "medical flight authorized by the competent health authorities". The entire Juve team were back in isolation on Wednesday evening after U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie tested positive. Both McKennie and Ronaldo are in quarantine and must test negative before rejoining their teammates. Under UEFA rules a player must provide evidence that he is no longer sick a week before a European match. Ronaldo, who will miss Juve's Serie A match with Crotone and their Champions League opener against Dynamo Kiev on October 20, must test negative on October 21 to play against Barcelona and old foe Lionel Messi a week later. (With input from agencies)Cristiano Ronaldo shot back at Italy's sports minister on Friday by denying that he broke the coronavirus protocol adopted for the country's football after returning from international duty while positive for the disease. On Thursday Minister of Sport Vincenzo Spadafora said that Portugal captain Ronaldo had broken protocol after he left isolation with his club Juventus to join up with his national team and then returned to Italy following his positive test. "I never broke the protocol," Ronaldo said during an interview on Instagram, "I followed all the protocols and I will continue to follow them, my conscience is clear ...

"In the next couple of years, I'm sure we'll get the best out of him."Meanwhile, United skipper Harry Maguire is keen to play on and overcome his poor recent displays for club and country but could miss the Newcastle game with a knock, Solskjaer added.Maguire endured a torrid time in United's 6-1 thrashing by Tottenham Hotspur before the international break and sustained an injury before being sent off in England's 1-0 Nations League defeat by Denmark on Wednesday.But Solskjaer backed the 27-year-old, who also featured in England's 2-1 win over Belgium, to give his critics a fitting response if he is fit enough to play this weekend."When Harry is part of the England team that beats number one-ranked Belgium it's a normal day. Then you get the headlines when you get a sending off, that's football. You have to deal with it," Solskjaer told reporters."Harry has got great resilience. He knows he will bounce back. He wants to play and work his way out of the last couple of games he's been criticized for."But he picked up a knock just before he came off the other night so we'll have a look at him today."United's defeat by Spurs left them in 16th place with three points from as many matches and Solskjaer said his players were ready to turn their fortunes around."We know we've started the season badly and that game ended really badly... we know we have to perform better but we've now had two weeks to think about it, work on it," Solskjaer said.Manchester United have triggered a one-year option on Paul Pogba's contract, extending the France midfielder's deal until June 2022, British media reported on Friday.The 27-year-old returned to United from Juventus in a then world-record deal worth 89 million pounds (114.93 million U.S. dollars) in 2016 but Pogba has suffered with inconsistent form and injuries at Old Trafford amidst constant speculation over his future.The reports said United's decision to extend his contract was taken before Pogba said on international duty with France that he would love to play for Real Madrid one day.United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brushed off those comments from the Frenchman, who would have been out of contract next June, during his news conference on the eve of Saturday's Premier League clash at Newcastle United."Paul's our player, he's going to be here for another two years and sure he's focused on doing his best for us and we want to see the best for Paul," Solskjaer said.

Races have been held with teams operating in isolated bubbles and with regular testing.The total number of races was cut to 17 from the record 22 originally envisaged and the first eight races of the season were held without spectators. Portugal will be round 12.Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million people, initially won praise for its quick response to the pandemic, recording a comparatively low 95,902 confirmed coronavirus cases and 2,149 deaths, but cases have crept up lately.On Friday, the country hit 2,608 daily cases, the highest number of infections in a single day since the pandemic started, according to its health authority, although testing rates have also increased.Also on Friday, the organizer of Vietnam's first F1 Grand pPrix said it has canceled the race, having already postponed the event initially scheduled for April due to the COVID-19 pandemic.F1 races schedulesOctober 31- November 1, Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at the Enzo e Dino Ferrari race track in Italy (no in-person attendance)November 13-15, Turkish Grand Prix at Istanbul Park circuit in Turkey (limited in-person attendance)November 27-29, Bahrain Grand Prix at Bahrain circuit (limited in-person attendance)December 4-6, Sakhir Grand Prix at Bahrain circuit (limited in-person attendance)December 11-13, Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at Yas Marina Circuit in UAE (limited in-person attendance)(With input from agencies)Portugal's health authority said on Friday it was reconsidering whether to allow fans into sports events, including next week's F1 Grand Prix for which thousands of tickets had been sold, as it is trying to contain a surge in COVID-19 infections.Without providing further details, the head of the health authority, Graca Freitas, told a news conference another option under consideration was to reduce the number of spectators.The director of the 90,000 capacity Portimao circuit, in the country's southern Algarve region, said in August around 28,000 tickets had already been sold but warned fans would not be allowed in if the pandemic worsened.F1 announced in July the Portimao circuit would host a grand prix for the first time as part of a revised calendar after some other races were cancelled as a result of the pandemic.The October 24-25 race is also due to mark the return of the exclusive Paddock Club hospitality for VIP guests for the first time this season.Freitas said the decision will take into consideration the epidemiological situation in the region where the event is happening and the type of event in question.There was no immediate comment from F1 as only "limited in-person attendance" message posted on its website.The Portuguese race was scheduled to mark the gradual return of fans to F1 races and five figure attendance is anticipated for upcoming races in Imola and Istanbul in November.According to F1 health protocols, all spectators must wear masks, have their temperature tested, and stick to their designated seat.After F1 held its first eight races behind closed doors, the first race to allow fans to attend in limited numbers was the Tuscan Grand Prix at Mugello in Italy on September 13.The Ferrari-owned track allowed 2,880 paying fans to attend each day.F1 welcomed spectators in greater numbers so far in a COVID-19 hit season at the Russian Grand Prix between September 25 and 27, attracting a 30,000 strong crowd in attendance.The start of the F1 season was pushed back to July from March due to the pandemic.

shrugged off any lingering fatigue to score twice in his second game in 48 hours as Paris Saint-Germain defeated 10-man Nimes 4-0 on Friday to take over top spot in Ligue 1.The France forward struck the opener on 32 minutes at the Stade des Costieres and netted again late on as a weary Nimes folded following the early dismissal of center-back Loick Landre.Alessandro Florenzi scored PSG's second on 77 minutes and Pablo Sarabia notched a fourth for the reigning champions as PSG climbed above Rennes on goal difference after a fifth successive win."I spoke with Kylian yesterday, he told me that he felt good and that he absolutely wanted to play," said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel."He's the guy who can always make a difference and he did just that."New signings Moise Kean and Rafinha made their PSG debuts with a host of players missing following the international break and just four days ahead of the visit of Manchester United in the Champions League.Ander Herrera, cleared to return after a positive Covid-19 test, drew the first in a series of superb saves from Nimes goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet having replaced the injured Paredes.But Mbappe gave PSG the lead after he was played through by Rafinha, rounding the advancing Reynet before slotting in his third league goal of the campaign.  Everton loanee Kean should have added a second but was denied by an alert Reynet, with Idrissa Gueye and Florenzi also testing the Nimes keeper.Florenzi rattled the post twice in the second half, with a volley and header, but the Italy defender eventually gave PSG room to breathe as he nodded in Sarabia's header back across goal.Mbappe promptly grabbed his second of the night with another nerveless finish after Sarabia shredded a tiring Nimes defence.The Spaniard then caught out the hosts from a quickly-taken free-kick to smack in a fourth through the legs of Reynet two minutes from the end. Earlier, Rennes extended their unbeaten start to the Ligue 1 season despite drawing 1-1 at bottom side Dijon.Lille or Lens could overtake PSG and Rennes with victory in Sunday's Derby du Nord, the first such fixture in over five years.(With input from AFP)Kylian Mbappe shrugged off any

China's two young female skates Lin Shan and Zhu Yi are expected to participate at Skate America as they are currently training overseas.(Cover image: Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China perform at the Gala Exhibition during day three of the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Cup of China at Huaxi Sports Center in Chongqing, China, November 10, 2019. /VCG)TOP HEADLINES- France has reported a record 30,621 new daily cases, bringing the country's cumulative total to 809,684. - Germany has warned against non-essential travel to France, the Netherlands, Malta and Slovakia after a spike in infection rates in those countries. - Hundreds of Catalonia's hospitality workers gathered in Barcelona on Friday to protest against the 15-day lockdown of all bars and restaurants in the region.- France is to introduce rapid tests at airports by the end of October in a bid to revive air traffic in the country, its transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said. - A Berlin court has suspended a curfew on the city's bars and restaurants because it considers it "disproportionate in view of other measures taken to fight the pandemic."- Belgium's foreign minister and deputy premier, Sophie Wilmes, has announced she will self-isolate after experiencing virus symptoms. - The UK's Wimbledon tennis championships has admitted it is planning for next year's tournament to potentially be held without spectators amid the pandemic. - "The situation in Switzerland is deteriorating faster than elsewhere," according to the country's health minister Alain Berset.- Schools in Italy's southern region of Campania have decided to close less than a month after reopening amid a surge of new cases in the area. - France Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has pledged $1.17 billion to help companies cope with the impact of the nation's new curfew in nine cities across the country, including Paris. - UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson has said he may have to intervene to save lives in Manchester if local leaders continue to disagree to a move to the highest virus alert level. - England is getting "very close" to the figures reported at the peak of the virus in April, according to Graham Medley, a government health adviser. - Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin has left the European Council after discovering she had come into contact with someone who has tested positive.   ACROSS EUROPEToni Waterman in BrusselsBelgiumBelgium had a record-breaking 10,448 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours as the country struggles to get the upper hand on the virus's spread.

Nicklaus, Greg Norman and Rory McIlroy, will not tee off."It's unprecedented and a real blow for Australian golf and its fans," said PGA of Australia chief executive Gavin Kirkman after what he called "months of exhaustive consultations."Australia has closed its international borders to most travelers as part of its effort to suppress the coronavirus pandemic, and even people moving between some of the country's different states and regions can be subject to a mandatory two-week quarantine.PGA officials considered a raft of options to deal with the restrictions, including players entering a hub and competing while serving a strict quarantine period, as well as restricting crowd numbers and movement.

In an interview with Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday, Li talked about his experience of coaching the national team, his expectations on the new CBA career and views over youth development.Li was appointed as team consultant of Jiangsu in May. Three months later, he became the new head coach of the team. Having finished the last season with a disappointing 17-29 record, Jiangsu are not only young â with an average age only 22 years old â but also little-known. Therefore, Li's job can be very challenging."It does give me a feeling of starting over coming to Jiangsu," said Li. "I was first player and then coach during my 23-, 24-year-long domestic career, but I did not have much experience of coaching top-level games or competitions close to top level. That's why I think it's time for me to start over at a club to collect more experience.""Our team has a lot of young men and only one or two 'older ones.' That means some of the young guys will appear in the starting lineup. Some of them will stay longer than others on the court. Maybe some of the boys are not ready yet, but that's where we are right now."Young blood never lacks passion or fighting spirit, but these are just uncut diamonds who still need time to refine their skills."We need rules both in practice and in the game. I want them to act on their own as long as they follow my forms. I don't want to make excessive demand on everything they do.â"Today's kids lack practice. â¦ I want to increase their practice time to make up for it. Second, I want help them learn how to fear no hardships and how not to give up in front of setbacks. These can all be done via daily training and management."It will take longer for people to forget China's failure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup at home in 2019. As the team's head coach, Li was questioned the most over his choice of rotation and timeouts."I think every coach has his own style and habit for calling timeout and deciding rotation. For example, I did not make that substitution at that moment but I couldn't say 'I should have done that' after the game. â¦ You can't do everything as others expect. They question you because they pay more attention to the result."Having coached the national team for over two years, Li generalized China's problems into two: lack of tough-battle experience and inferior individual ability."We played too little with European teams or stronger American teams, like only very few games a year. It's not the same as playing warm-up games at home. We need to go overseas and attend more competitions like the NBA Summer League or the contests in Europe. Ideally, you train for three or four weeks and then play three or four games. Then you start training again and do the same repeatedly. But our team cannot do this because of many difficulties.""When we say a player 'carries his own system,' like LeBron James, it means wherever he goes, the team plays in his way. Our national team does not have guys like that. We have no Sonny Weems or Jeremy Lin. We always say we play as a team, but how? What is our style? Our players' ability defines team's style. For China, I think passing is still our problem. So is penetrating. We used to call guys who can slash with absolute speed 'sharp blade.' Now we don't have enough of those players."Then what can Chinese players do to solve this problem? Li believes the key lies in making players ask more of themselves. "Chinese players, especially the young ones, are too easily satisfied and lack sense of competition. Without sense of competition, they can't find motivation. They are too comfortable in the clubs. They fall short of the best but are better than the worst. That can't be good for players. That's why I kept telling my guys: you need to want to get better before we can help you.

The fact that they won it in misfortune year only made the title even more special.While everyone was happy, the Lakers' front office may need to leave the parties behind, sit back in front of the desk and figure out how to deal with their current lineup.Anthony DavisThough he was not the Finals MVP, the fact is, the arrival of Davis brought the purple and gold Larry O'Brien Trophy this season. He still has one year (about $28.8 million) left of his current contract and he can choose to opt out of it. If he does, Davis will become an unrestricted free agent and can sign a new five-year deal worth $189.9 million with the Lakers.Hold on that thought because there are other ways to further maximize Davis' earnings. First, he can sign a 1+1 contract and opt out again in 2021 summer to sign a new extension. However, considering that the salary cap may not grow much next year, the increase of Davis' income will still be limited.ESPN's expert Bobby Marks suggested that Davis sign a 2+1 contract with the Lakers and opt out of it in 2022 summer. There will be several benefits via doing so. First, Davis will be qualified for Designated Veteran Player Extension, which is also known as a supermax deal. If the NBA revenues return to normal in 2022, Davis can sign a five-year contract worth $243.6 million with the team.LeBron JamesJames received the fourth Finals MVP of his for good reasons. He led in average points (29.8), rebounds (11.8), true shooting percentage (67.1) and effective field goal percentage (65.7) of the two teams' major rotations during the series. James still has two years ($39.2 million and $41 million) left of his current deal with the Lakers.The purple and gold have the right to extend James contract this summer by another two years, paying him $43 million and $46.5 million in the last two years. Despite his incredible performance this season, James is turning 36 years old in December. Leading the team to win the 17th title definitely deserves reward. The Lakers will need to decide how much the reward should be.Others with player optionThe following four guys have player option during the off-season: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, JaVale McGee and Avery Bradley.Averaging 8.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.0 steals during the Finals did not tell how important Rondo was to the Lakers. He is the team's second orchestrator, bond of perimeter defense and ball distributor in half-court offense.According to Chris Sheridan of BasketballNews.com, Rondo will understandably opt out of the $2.7-million deal of his to become an unrestricted player. Judging by his performance in the playoffs and his old age (34 year), it should not be hard for Rondo to get a two-year, $16-million deal.Pope averaged 12.8 points, the third-highest of the Lakers during the Finals. His defense of Duncan Robinson was very impressive. Though his 30.3-percent 3-point rate was not pretty but Pope took 43 triple attempts, the most of the team and made 13 of them, the second most of the purple and gold. He fit well playing along James.Pope's contract will pay him $8.5 million next year. If he opts out of it, he may receive a similar number of average annual salary.Neither McGee nor Bradley got much chance in the bubble in Orlando. If McGee opts out of his contract, he should still be able to find a new job thanks to his size, athleticism and finishing ability. Bradley, by contrast, may not be that lucky.The Lakers won't have much cap space even if they let all of the four go.

Ajan had been at the IWF for 44 years as general secretary and president. Richard McLaren, the Canadian law professor whose findings in July 2016 led to Russia being banned from all international athletic competitions, including the Rio Olympics, told reporters in June that the IWF was rife with corruption. This included vote buying, doping cover-ups and $10.4 million in cash that cannot be accounted for.

That will put the 2024 event on February 13, bringing it into conflict with New Orleans' Mardi Gras event; hence the league's decision.According to CNBC, the NFL will decide next year over the location for 2024 Super Bowl.

New Orleans, which was supposed to host Super Bowl LVIII in 2024, will have to wait one more year to witness Super Bowl take place at the New Orleans Saints' Mercedes-Benz Superdome for the eighth time.As the NFL will extend the regular season to 17 games from next year, Super Bowl will be one week later than usual as well. That will put the 2024 event on February 13, bringing it into conflict with New Orleans' Mardi Gras event; hence the league's decision.According to CNBC, the NFL will decide next year over the location for 2024 Super Bowl. "We anticipate interest from Las Vegas and other cities around the country to host America's most popular even," said an NFL spokesperson.By the way Super Bowl will take place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and State Farm Stadium in Arizona in 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively.Harry Maguire's miserable start to the season continued with a red card as England had two men sent off for the first time in their Nations League defeat by Denmark, while Kylian Mbappe gave World Cup holders France a 2-1 victory in Croatia and Portugal won without Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday.Christian Eriksen's penalty on his 100th appearance for Denmark earned his side a 1-0 win over England in their Nations League clash at Wembley.Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eriksen powered his spot-kick past Jordan Pickford in the 35th minute, a couple of minutes after England center-back Harry Maguire had received a red card for a second booking.The defeat ended a run of nine successive home wins for England, who beat top-ranked Belgium on Sunday, while Denmark, who have lost just two of their last 40 international matches, celebrated their first victory over England at Wembley since 1983.England slipped to third place in Group A2 which is now headed by Belgium with Denmark above England on goal difference."Disappointed to lose the match but extremely proud of how we responded to going down to 10 men," said England manager Gareth Southgate, who rather surprisingly opted not to send on Aston Villa's creative midfielder Jack Grealish when chasing the game."We had a few chances that on another day would have gone in. The 10 men changes the game and they get a soft penalty."While it was a memorable night for Danish playmaker Eriksen, it was a disappointing one for England who suffered only their second home defeat in 32 competitive internationals.Mbappe strike gives France 2-1 win in CroatiaFrance stretched their unbeaten run against Croatia to eight games after a late goal by Kylian Mbappe gave the World Cup holders a 2-1 win in their Nations League top-tier Group 3 match on Wednesday.The result left France second in the group on 10 points from four games, behind Portugal on goal difference after the European champions brushed aside Sweden 3-0. Croatia have three points and the Swedes none.France beat Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 World Cup final before defeating them by the same score in last month's reverse Nations League fixture."We knew we'd be in a real battle," France coach Didier Deschamps told French TF1 television."We started very well and it's a pity we didn't go two goals clear as Kylian had a big chance. We did what we needed to do in the second half."It's not because we won a trophy in 2018 that you win by clicking your fingers. You have to look at the way the opponents play too."Croatia defender Dejan Lovren rued his team's concentration lapses."France are ruthlessly efficient and they will punish you every time you switch off, even for a split second," he told reporters."Playing against them is very frustrating because you can be as entertaining as you like but to no avail. The three points is all that matters."Portugal brush off Ronaldo absence to outclass SwedenGoals from Bernardo Silva and a brace from Diogo Jota gave Portugal a comfortable 3-0 win over Sweden in the Nations League on Wednesday as the hosts made light of the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo due to a positive COVID-19 test.With 10 points from four games, Portugal top Group 2 in League A on goal difference ahead of France, who beat Croatia 2-1 in Zagreb. The Swedes are bottom of the group after slumping to four straight defeats."We were not asked to play any differently [without Ronaldo], our ambition remains the same," Manchester United's Portuguese midfielder Bruno Fernandes told reporters."The team has great values but it is obvious that it is easier to win with the best in the world."(With input from agencies)Harry Maguire's miserable start to the season continued with a red card as England had two men sent off for the first time in their Nations League defeat by Denmark, while Kylian Mbappe gave World Cup holders France a 2-1 victory in Croatia and Portugal won without Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday.Christian Eriksen's penalty on his 100th appearance for Denmark earned his side a 1-0 win over England in their Nations League clash at Wembley.Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eriksen powered his spot-kick past Jordan Pickford in the 35th minute, a couple of minutes after England center-back Harry Maguire had received a red card for a second booking.The defeat ended a run of nine successive home wins for England, who beat top-ranked Belgium on Sunday, while Denmark, who have lost just two of their last 40 international matches, celebrated their first victory over England at Wembley since 1983.England slipped to third place in Group A2 which is now headed by Belgium with Denmark above England on goal difference."Disappointed to lose the match but extremely proud of how we responded to going down to 10 men," said England manager Gareth Southgate, who rather surprisingly opted not to send on Aston Villa's creative midfielder Jack Grealish when chasing the game."We had a few chances that on another day would have gone in.

The 28-year-old denied the wrongdoing and stressed his innocence. "I feel I am already seen as a sinner of doping, but I am not," Wanjiru said when he heard of his provisional suspension. "I am innocent."According to the AIU's disciplinary report on Wanjiru, the international athlete accepted a "volunteer provisional suspension" in December 2019, agreeing not to race until the final outcome of the case was delivered. Because of this, the four-year ban has been backdated to the day of his original suspension on December 9 last year, which means he won't be allowed to compete again until December 2023. Wanjiru rose to fame after beating Kenenisa Bekele to the 2017 London Marathon title. He was also the winner at the Amsterdam Marathon in 2016, where he set his marathon PB at 2:05:21.In addition to his ban, all results Wanjiru recorded from March 9, 2019, the date when the test was taken, will be disqualified including forfeiture of any medals, titles, ranking points and prize and appearance money.Kenyan long-distance runner Daniel Wanjiru was banned for four years by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) on Wednesday following an Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) violation. He was provisionally suspended in April for "use of a prohibited substance/method" after "abnormalities" were found in his biological passport.

In two weeks, the government will evaluate the situation to see whether the rules should be loosened or tightened.In he past seven days, 43,903 people tested positive for COVID-19, an increase of almost 60 percent compared with the week before, while 150 people died, compared with 89 the week before.Iolo ap Dafydd in London Millions of people in the north of England from today are living under stricter conditions as a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic grips the UK.The government's new three-tier system has been implemented, with in Liverpool city and the surrounding region placed on the highest third tier, which could last for three weeks. It's not a total lockdown, as schools, universities and retail shops stay open. Pubs and bars not selling food have to close, so do other businesses where social distancing is difficult.  For now, the rest of the country is in tier one and two, but areas such as Greater Manchester, the North East, south Yorkshire and parts of the Midlands could follow if infections keeps increasing.The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said it was "disappointing" how the Conservative government is "piling the pressure" on his region "without negotiating."The political clash between the UK's right-wing government and center-left opposition parties, including the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland, is deepening. The main opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has called for a two- to three-week national lockdown in England, to try to break the viral cycle. Mark Drakeford, Wales's Labour first minister has repeatedly called for those living in high COVID-19 areas of England not to visit Wales, where local lockdowns are in place.The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasnât endorsed that and argues the English system is a "moderate" and "balanced" approach to saving lives and protecting the economy at the same time.Mia Alberti in FrankfurtGermany reached yet another record of daily coronavirus cases since April, having registered 5,132 new infections on Wednesday. The total number of positive tests is now 334,585, according to the Robert Koch Institute. There were also 40 more deaths, a substantial increase compared with previous days. The death toll now stands at 9,677.This comes as Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to meet with German state leaders to discuss further restrictions. The meeting will be held in person for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, showing the urgency felt by the chancellor to curb the exponential increase in cases of the past few weeks.   FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: Chinese mainland reports 20 new COVID-19 casesCGTN America: New York Philharmonic cancels 2020/21 season CGTN Africa: Uganda authorities caution parents against issuing sanitizers to learnersSign up here to get the COVID-19 Europe bulletin sent directly to your inboxCGTN Europe has been providing in-depth coverage of the novel coronavirus story as it has unfolded. Here you can read the essential information about the crisis.Miu Hirano, who won women's singles title for Japan at the Table Tennis World Cup in 2016, decided to quit the upcoming ITTF World Tour Grand Finals because of lower back pain, announced her management company on Tuesday.

Kato's teammates included Mima Ito, Kasumi Ishikawa and Hitomi Sato. Kato participated in the World Table Tennis Championships last year. She started to draw more attention after defeating Ito and China's Chen Meng at ITTF's T2 Diamond League this July.Ito, who currently ranks second in the world, has confirmed she will attend the Finals. Having missed formal matches for eight months, the Japanese ace was eager to find out what she can do now.World's top 16 ranking players were invited to this year's finals but each federation can send no more than four players to men's and women's competitions. China's Fan Zhendong, Xu Xin, Ma Long and Lin Gaoyuan were qualified for men's matches while Chen Meng, Sun Yingsha, Wang Manyu and Liu Shiwen were qualified for women's.

According to Hollinger, the league will give teams eight-week-notice ahead of the start of the season, which will be November 23.Postponing the beginning of the season was just the first step and more will follow. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is still far from under control in the U.S., should the league continue to put all games in a bubble? It's true that it worked behind closed doors in Orlando but let's face it: only 20 teams entered the bubble for eight regular season games and 16 of them attended the playoffs. What will happen if all 30 teams have to finish an 82-game regular season in a bubble (or multiple ones)?The trouble is not over. The NBA wants to bring fans back to the games as much as fans want to do the same. If the new season will take place in a bubble, the league will have to get creative in figuring out how to allow fans in while ensuring the bubble's safety.The MLB may offer the NBA an example to follow as the baseball league put several straight games in one place to slim down teams' time on the road and speed up the season. The NBA must watch out for two things if it wants to introduce that mechanism: first, read carefully the traveling restrictions of the Canadian government for the sake of the Toronto Raptors; second, determine the length of the season (the MLB cut it from 162 games to 60).There's also the problem with the Tokyo Olympics, which has already been postponed to July 2021. Basically, it's impossible for the NBA to finish the whole season before that and even if it somehow does it, one can't expect the best players to join the national team for Tokyo right after an exhausting competition. Either way, it seems unlikely for Team USA to get vengeance for their painful failure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in China in 2019 this time.The 2020 NBA Draft, like the beginning of the new season, was also postponed (to November 18). After that, the free agency market will open, followed by the training camps and then the 2020-21 season.The new NBA season, which should be the 2020-21 campaign, may only happen in 2021 â John Hollinger of The Athletic reported that the new season will begin on January 18, 2021.That means the NBA will return on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and there won't be Christmas Day games.

A game postponed and rescheduled with a second pushed back. Only one practice with two walk-throughs and unrelenting criticism.The Titans remain depleted. They're also still undefeated.Ryan Tannehill threw for three touchdowns and ran for another as the Titans routed the Buffalo Bills 42-16 on a rare Tuesday night in a showdown between two of the NFL's five remaining undefeated teams pushed back two days after a couple more positive tests for Tennessee last week."What this organization has been through over the past couple weeks to really fight through all of that, shake it all off, really limited practice, limited reps and go out and put this kind of win together, I think makes a statement and I'm happy we were able to do that today," Tannehill said.The Titans (4-0) continued their best start since winning their first 10 games in 2008 despite not playing their last game September 27 in Minnesota. Coach Mike Vrabel said everyone in the organization would get a game ball after this performance."I learned a long time ago that the definition of a pro is they make the hard look easy, so whatever situation we're presented with we got to all come together and make the best decisions for the team each and every time," Vrabel said.Malcolm Butler intercepted two passes, the second he returned 68 yards, and both set up short touchdowns for Tennessee. Kareem Orr's recovery of a fumbled kickoff set up Tannehill's fourth TD for 21 points off Buffalo's three turnovers. Kalif Raymond's 40-yard punt return also set up a 1-yard TD run by Derrick Henry."We expected to win," Butler said.The Bills (4-1) had not won five straight games since 2004, and they came in looking for the franchise's best start since 1991 when Buffalo reached the Super Bowl. They also played without starting cornerbacks with Tre'Davious White inactive because of a back injury and Levi Wallace on injured reserve.Starting wide receiver John Brown also was out for Buffalo, which had scored at least 30 points in the past three games."They were ready to go and at the same time we beat ourselves," Bills coach Sean McDermott said.Buffalo center Mitch Morse called this a gut-punch."It's tough, they came out and beat us like a drum," Morse said.Josh Allen came in second in the NFL in yards passing. He threw for 263 yards and two TDs. Stephon Diggs had 10 catches for 106 yards.The Titans needed the turnovers with seven key players on the reserve/COVID-19 list led by wide receivers Corey Davis and Adam Humphries and defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons. They also were missing a couple assistant coaches and two players activated off that reserve list earlier Tuesday were scratched.The Titans got a big boost on the Bills' opening drive.Allen's pass went off Andre Roberts' hands right to Butler, and he returned the interception 29 yards to the Bills 16. Two plays later, Tannehill hit A. J. Brown, who missed the last two games with an injured knee, for a 16-yard TD for the quick lead.The Bills tied it up with a methodical 15-play drive converting four third downs, taking advantage of a Titans' defense playing a pair of rookies in end Larrell Murchison and cornerback Chris Jackson. Allen tossed the ball to Isaiah McKenzie for a 3-yard TD tying it up, the ninth different Bill to catch a TD pass from Allen.The Titans scored 21 of the next 24 points.Tennessee led 21-10 at halftime after Tannehill ran in from 10 yards seconds before the half. Butler refused to go down after picking off an Allen throw to Gabriel Davis late in the third, and Tannehill found Jonnu Smith for a 4-yard TD and a 28-10 lead three plays later.Bills will host Kansas City on Monday night. Safety Micah Hyde denied the Bills got caught looking ahead to the defending Super Bowl champs."No, no, no, no. We were 100 percent focused on the Titans," Hyde said. "We knew this game was going to be played one way or another. It was not looking forward to the Chiefs or anything."Titans will host Texans on Sunday.The Tennessee Titans just put together their most gratifying victory of coach Mike Vrabel's short tenure.They spent the past two weeks dealing with the NFL's first COVID-19 outbreak with each morning bringing news of yet another positive test.

I think the car is obviously outperforming me at the moment because I cannot extract the maximum from the car," he said after completing the maximum 100km allowed."Getting back to the F1 speed is not so easy. I was improving lap after lap and trying to give feedback to the engineers. Also, we had some filming to do, so there were cameras, there were drones following on track."Team boss Cyril Abiteboul said after Sunday's Eifel Grand Prix at Germany's Nuerburgring, where Ricciardo finished third for Renault's first podium since their return as a constructor in 2016, that Alonso was champing to return."We received a message before, during and after the race," said the Frenchman."I think Fernando is like a big shark.

Gavranovic then grabbed his second only for Serge Gnabry to earn Germany a point.The result moves Germany within a point of League A Group Four leaders Spain, who remain on seven points after losing 1-0 away to a Ukraine side now on six points, while the Swiss, still without a win, stay bottom with two points.Germany coach Joachim Loew reverted to a four-man defense for the game in an empty stadium, after they had led in the last four games only to concede equalizers in three of them.But it remained their weak spot on Tuesday as they struggled with quick breaks from the Swiss who found far too much space."It was extremely intense. We started badly but showed great attitude in coming back," Loew said. "That was positive. In defense we made our share of mistakes which we have to stop. But we showed that the team is ready to fight."The Swiss had stunned Germany with Gavranovic's fifth minute header and doubled the lead in the 26th when they intercepted a pass from Toni Kroos, playing in his 100th international, and Freuler beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with a cool chip.Werner hit back for the hosts two minutes later, wrong-footing keeper Yann Sommer with a clever low shot, as the Germans maintained possession and kept pushing forward.Robin Gosens' effort was tipped over the bar by Sommer late in the first half but the keeper was beaten when Havertz charged into the box and fired in the equalizer in the 55th.But Germany's backline kept leaking goals as the Swiss went back in front in the 57th. Neuer made consecutive saves from Haris Seferovic but Gavranovic drilled in on the rebound.A sensational Gnabry back heel flick on the hour pulled the home side level once more and rescued a point for Loew's team.Elsewhere, England striker Harry Kane is fit to start Wednesday's Nations League match against Denmark but defenders Ben Chilwell and Kieran Trippier have withdrawn from the squad, manager Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday.Kane did not start Sunday's 2-1 win over Belgium and only came on as a substitute but Southgate said he was "fully fit" even as Tottenham Hotspur urged England to exercise caution over the striker's workload amid a congested schedule.England are top of Nations League Group A2 with seven points after three games, one point ahead of second-placed Belgium.(With input from agencies)Germany twice had to come from behind to earn a rollercoaster 3-3 draw against visitors Switzerland in an exciting Nations League group game packed with incident in Cologne, Germany on Tuesday.The Swiss took an early lead through Mario Gavranovic and Remo Freuler added a second before goals from Timo Werner and Kai Havertz leveled the scores.

Adapted from real events and told through the lens of volleyball legend Lang Ping, it offers a unique glimpse into some of the contentious issues that have compounded her complicated legacy.And therein lies the novelty."'Leap' is distinguished from other patriotic movies in the way that it treats characters in a rather refreshing way while injecting the story with fresh narratives and far-reaching hints," Jing, a movie reviewer who runs his own review website, told CGTN.In recent years, China's entertainment industry has been flooded with movies featuring historical events effusing patriotic sentiments. Making billions in box-office revenues, these movies are beloved by Chinese cinema-goers.While some of these are repetitive, they serve a purpose. "We do need these movies to convey some messages," said Li Jing, another freelance movie reviewer.But "stories need to be told in a way that characters are fully formed," Li explained. "'Leap' is not perfect, but it shows the effort of focusing the narrative on an intricate character."A standard Chinese patriotic movie tends to emphasize individual sacrifices for the collective, but "Leap" did not follow that path, according to Jing. "I believe Peter Ho-sun Chan, the movie director, was more keen on examining the reconciliation between individual fulfillment and collective interests. It transcends the idea that war-time blockbusters are the only type of movies that audiences like."Lang was an indefatigable player in the national women's team when China was just opening up to the outside world in the 1980s. At a time when patriotism was running high and winning sports events on the global stage signified tremendous national pride, Lang and her team secured thrilling victories â including a world championship title and Olympic gold â that still reverberate across the country.After taking up a coaching career in the U.S. and successfully guiding the U.S. national team to notable victories, she returned to China and was determined to lead the struggling Chinese national team back to its peak. But by then, she was no longer just a patriot elated by winning glory for her country, but had become a seasoned, reserved coach accustomed to both victory or defeat.And "Leap" touches on the contentious theme underlying that change: her questioning of China's sports system, where top athletes are required to devote all their energy to their sport but are not prepared for life after their career is over."'Leap' not only acknowledges the fading trend of patriotism in contemporary China, a cause for the loss of spirit that once motivated athletes of older generations, but also hints at Lang's change in attitude towards volleyball as well as the drawbacks of China's sports system," Jing said. "In this respect, Chan approaches these topics with full honesty."Lang suffered permanent injuries due to strenuous training in her early career as an athlete. Even now, she still holds a disability certificate in the U.S.. But before she left China for an overseas coaching career, she was allegedly refused reimbursement for some costly medical bills by the Chinese volleyball association."Chan is very adept at presenting individualism as the product of our time. One of his signature movies in the 1990s, 'Comrades: Almost a Love Story,' depicts a woman who puts her self-interest above others," said Li."In 'Leap,' we can see the unraveling of the same discussion. Though bound to offend some in the audience, this is the sharp reflection of reality," Li added."Leap" follows a number of other bold and thought-provoking films that have come out in recent years.The 2018 movie "The Shadow Play" by Lou Ye took a sharp look at the pervasive practices of forced relocation. "Dying to survive" by Wen Muye, also released in 2018, offers a critical view of China's medical system."Dearest," another one of Chan's works, provocatively dove into the issues surrounding child abduction and did not shun away from the problematic ramifications of China's birth control policies."These movies turned out to be more popular and often received good reviews," noted Jing."Leap" topped the Chinese box office in the first week of its release and has already made 700 million yuan ($104.19 million) since then.Despite speculation that China's censorship system is tightening its grip on the movie industry, a growing number of movie makers have been toeing the line of what is acceptable to the film censors.Lou Ye, director of "The Shadow Play," is known to have challenged the censorship system for years.

Change is never popular, but sometimes change is necessary," observed English Football League (EFL) chairman Ricky Parry, who has long called for "a complete rethink" over the make-up of the country's football. For Parry, the current situation is dire to say the least. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the sports industry, the EFL was full of poorly-managed clubs with a huge financial hole. "The need for a complete rethinking regarding the funding of English professional football predates the COVID-19 crisis," said Parry, who oversees 72 clubs in the three divisions below the Premier League. "The gap between the Premier League and the EFL has become a chasm which has become unbridgeable for clubs transitioning between the EFL and Premier League," he added. This stance is echoed by Nigel Travis, chairman of League Two side Leyton Orient. "Before the pandemic, 75 percent of clubs were losing money - that can't continue. The pandemic has, if you like, exacerbated the problem and we need to get it fixed," he told BBC in a recent interview. "One thing I need to quash is, this isn't about the pandemic, this is about a crisis in football that goes back many years. If clubs don't get something soon you will see clubs disappear, I would predict, within five-six weeks," Travis predicted. Under such circumstances, a radical reform plan, which has been dubbed 'Project Big Picture' was duly unveiled by EFL over the weekend. According to multiple British media outlets, the plan was mainly devised by Liverpool owner, John W Henry, and the Manchester United chairman, Joel Glazer, while Parry, a lifelong Liverpool fan and former Chief Executive of the club, was the driving force behind it. "It's a day to applaud Liverpool and Manchester United," beamed Parry. "Not to be suspicious, not to be critical, but actually just to look at the nuts and bolts of the plan, which really do stand out. Very clear, very simple. It is about a reset. It is about redistribution."Under the proposals, the Premier League will cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with both the League Cup and Community Shield being abolished. Meanwhile, a 250 million pounds ($325 million) rescue fund will be made immediately available to the EFL, who could sell its broadcast rights alongside those of the top flight and would take 25 percent of the future revenue. Most significantly of all, however, the traditional 'big six' of Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur will be given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, which means only six votes will be required to implement significant changes in the future. It inevitably led to accusations of a power grab and triggered a fierce criticism from the UK government. "It's clear that this proposal does not command support throughout the Premier League - it is exactly this type of backroom dealing that undermines trust in football governance," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also condemned what it called a "backroom deal.""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game," a DCMS spokesperson said. The Premier League later weighed in by releasing a statement saying: "In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support." "Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute," it added.While Parry remained unequivocal in his support of the plan, the seeds of division have already been sowed.  "Some Premier League club are very much against the proposal," a West Ham source was quoted as saying by the BBC. "The big six are using COVID for a power grab. If this goes through, over time they will just use more and more for themselves." But another Premier League club source told the Guardian that he was confident about the prospect of the plan, adding: "Beggars can't be choosers. It is about saving the game from oblivion." "Change is never easy.

Meanwhile, a 250 million pounds ($325 million) rescue fund will be made immediately available to the EFL, who could sell its broadcast rights alongside those of the top flight and would take 25 percent of the future revenue. Most significantly of all, however, the traditional 'big six' of Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur will be given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, which means only six votes will be required to implement significant changes in the future. It inevitably led to accusations of a power grab and triggered a fierce criticism from the UK government. "It's clear that this proposal does not command support throughout the Premier League - it is exactly this type of backroom dealing that undermines trust in football governance," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also condemned what it called a "backroom deal.""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game," a DCMS spokesperson said. The Premier League later weighed in by releasing a statement saying: "In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support." "Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute," it added.While Parry remained unequivocal in his support of the plan, the seeds of division have already been sowed.  "Some Premier League club are very much against the proposal," a West Ham source was quoted as saying by the BBC. "The big six are using COVID for a power grab. If this goes through, over time they will just use more and more for themselves." But another Premier League club source told the Guardian that he was confident about the prospect of the plan, adding: "Beggars can't be choosers. It is about saving the game from oblivion." Borussia Dortmund's Youssoufa Moukoko, who turns 16 on November 20, could make Champions League history next month by becoming the competition's youngest player ever. Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc told German daily Bild "we will enter him on the B list" for the group stages of the Champions League, with Dortmund having drawn Zenit Saint Petersburg, Brugge and Lazio in Group F. The 15-year-old Moukoko, already a prolific scorer in German youth football, is not on the club's 'A' list of players registered for the Champions League competition. However, he will be on their 'B' list, which according to UEFA regulations means a 16-year-old can play, provided he has been at the club for at least two years. Moukoko joined Dortmund in 2016. He will turn 16 four days before Dortmund host Brugge in the group stages on November 24, when he could become the youngest player in Champions League history.The record is currently held by Nigeria's Celestine Babayaro, now 42, who was 16 years, 86 days old when he played for Anderlecht against Steaua Bucharest in 1994.He famously lasted just 34 minutes before being sent off, but went on to spend eight years at Chelsea.In 2018/19, Moukoko scored 50 goals in 28 matches for Dortmund's Under-17 side against much older opponents. Last season, aged 14, he moved up to the U19 squad and scored 38 goals in 28 matches.Last month, the 15-year-old scored a hat-trick in his first Under-19 game and has already trained with Dortmund's senior squad.He also made his debut in September for the German U20 national team.However, Sebastian Kehl, head of Dortmund's player department, told SID that the club is keen to dampen the hype around their "wunderkind."Making his professional debut would be "a big step and he is only 15 years old. We must give him the necessary peace and time" to develop, Kehl added.Dortmund currently have two 17-year-olds in their first team in Giovanni Reyna and England junior international Jude Bellingham.Borussia Dortmund's Youssoufa Moukoko, who turns 16 on November 20, could make Champions League history next month by becoming the competition's youngest player ever. Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc told German daily Bild "we will enter him on the B list" for the group stages of the Champions League, with Dortmund having drawn Zenit Saint Petersburg, Brugge and Lazio in Group F. The 15-year-old Moukoko, already a prolific scorer in German youth football, is not on the club's 'A' list of players registered for the Champions League competition. However, he will be on their 'B' list, which according to UEFA regulations means a 16-year-old can play, provided he has been at the club for at least two years.

Let the better one win!" Pulev later posted in his profile on the social media Facebook.He did not mention if the bout will be behind closed doors due to Covid-19 restrictions as earlier expected, prompting Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn to say he was willing to move the fight to the Middle East if an audience is allowed there.Joshua beat Andy Ruiz to regain the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles in Saudi Arabia in December.He is, however, due to put them up for grabs in a mandatory fight with the Bulgarian.Pulev has been waiting for a chance to face Joshua for almost three years now after a shoulder injury forced him out of a world title bout in October 2017.The fight should be Joshua's last before taking on WBC champion Tyson Fury in a lucrative all-British unification bout next year.Fury is set to defend his belt before Christmas before what UK media report will be a springtime clash at Wembley, assuming coronavirus crowd restrictions have been lifted by then.The Daily Mail reports that Fury's rematch with Deontay Wilder has been called off due to the "imminent expiration" of the American's contractual right to the third match between the pair, paving the way for the Gypsy King's bout with Joshua.Kubrat Pulev confirmed on Monday that he will face the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua in a title bout in London on December 12.Britain's Joshua was originally scheduled to fight Pulev on June 20, with a second date in July also mooted amid the coronavirus pandemic."It's official: Pulev vs. Joshua on December 12 in London," Pulev posted on his official webpage on Monday, adding that the date and place were final and the contract had been signed."There is no way back, no postponement, no rescheduling!...

I don't think today about the 20th and equal Roger on this great number, today is just a Roland Garros victory and that means everything to me," the world number two said."This love story I have with this city and this court is unforgettable."The final, expected by many to be another great clash in one of the sport's greatest rivalries, turned out to be a bit of a surprise as Nadal dominated throughout in a one-sided match with a flawless performance to score his 100th match win in Paris. He raised his game to an unbelievable level from the start, granting his opponent no error space as he answered every ball deep and heavy. Nadal only committed six unforced errors in the opening two sets altogether and maintained his form to produce a high-quality third set before sealing his victory against Djokovic. "Today you showed why you are the king of clay. Today was a tough match, I was outplayed by a better player today," said Djokovic after losing his third Roland Garros final to Nadal and failing to shrink the gap with Federer and the Spaniard for the most major wins. "He did surprise me with the way he was playing, the quality of tennis he was producing, the level. He's phenomenal. He played a perfect match, especially in the first two sets."Heading into the tournament, many were doubtful about Nadal's continuing dominance amid unfavorable weather conditions as well as his lack of usual preparation on clay courts due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Nadal, this was the toughest test he had ever faced at Roland Garros. But he came through those challenges with potentially his highest level of play in the final to win the tournament.Unforced errors in the more competitive third set gave Djokovic a glimpse of hope that he could turn the match around. However, the king of clay held on, breaking again in the 11th game and bagging the victory. Nadal and Federer, with their haul of 20 majors, now stand three clear of Djokovic, the last active player to beat the Spaniard at Roland Garros.Federer, who has been recovering from knee surgery and just confirmed his participation in the 2021 Australian Open, congratulated his friend."I have always had the utmost respect for my friend Rafa as a person and a champion," he tweeted. "As my greatest rival over many years, I believe we have pushed each other to become better players.""Therefore it is a true honor for me to congratulate him on his 20th Grand Slam victory.

The ultimate joy.This season, for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, had it all. And it ended in the only fashion that they deemed would be acceptable, with them back atop the basketball world.For the first time since Kobe Bryant's fifth and final title a decade ago, the Lakers are NBA champions. James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Lakers beat the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday night to win the NBA Finals in six games.And it was only fitting that James took the top honors as he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player honors for a fourth time."It means a lot to represent this franchise," James said, recalling what he told team owner Jeanie Buss when he arrived in Los Angeles in 2018: "I wanted to put this franchise back where it belongs. For me to be a part of such a historical franchise is an unbelievable feeling."Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who had to deal with the anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise â and against the Heat franchise that showed him how to become a champion.Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler â the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention. Rajon Rondo scored 19 points for the Lakers.With that, the league's bubble chapter, put together after a four-and-a-half-month suspension of play that started on March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic, is over. So, too, is a season that saw political sparring between the league and China, the death on January 1 of commissioner emeritus David Stern â the man who did so much to make the league what it is â and then the shock on January 26 that came with the news that Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other had died in a helicopter crash.The Lakers said they were playing the rest of the season in his memory.They delivered what Bryant did five times for L.A. â a ring, and the clincher was emphatic.Game 6 was over by halftime, the Lakers taking a 64-36 lead into the break. The Heat never led and couldn't shoot from anywhere: 35 percent from 2-point range in the half, 33 percent from 3-point range and even an uncharacteristic 42 percent from the line, not like any of it really mattered. The Lakers were getting everything they wanted and then some, outscoring Miami 36-16 in the second quarter and doing all that with James making just one shot in the period.Rajon Rondo, now a two-time champion and the first to win rings as a player in both Boston and Los Angeles â the franchises now tied with 17 titles apiece â was 6 for 6 in the half, the first time he has done that since November 2007. The Lakers' lead was 46-32 with 5:00 left in the half, and they outscored Miami 18-4 from there until intermission.Ball game. The 28-point halftime lead was the second-biggest in NBA Finals history, topped only by the Celtics leading the Lakers 79-49 on May 27, 1985.True to form, the Heat â a No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference that finished with a losing record last season, a team that embraced the challenge of the bubble like none other â did not stop playing, not even when the deficit got to 36 in the third quarter.A 23-8 run by Miami got the Heat to 90-69 with 8:37 left. But the outcome was never in doubt, and before long confetti was blasted into the air as the Lakers' celebration formally and officially began.The ultimate anguish. The ultimate joy.This season, for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, had it all. And it ended in the only fashion that they deemed would be acceptable, with them back atop the basketball world.For the first time since Kobe Bryant's fifth and final title a decade ago, the Lakers are NBA champions. James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Lakers beat the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday night to win the NBA Finals in six games.And it was only fitting that James took the top honors as he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player honors for a fourth time."It means a lot to represent this franchise," James said, recalling what he told team owner Jeanie Buss when he arrived in Los Angeles in 2018: "I wanted to put this franchise back where it belongs. For me to be a part of such a historical franchise is an unbelievable feeling."Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who had to deal with the anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise â and against the Heat franchise that showed him how to become a champion.Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler â the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention.

"France are a great team. They have great players. It's not always possible to create opportunities."Pepe headed home what he thought was a 74th-minute opener when he got on the end of Bruno Fernandes' free-kick but was flagged offside.Ronaldo, chasing his 102nd international goal, was denied by a flying save from Hugo Lloris in added time.Mbappe fluffed France's best when Rui Patricio anticipated his gentle chip when one-on-one with the Portuguese stopper.Both sides are now on seven points, four ahead of Croatia, whose 2-1 home win over Sweden earlier on Sunday was the group's more entertaining match, with a calamitous late lapse from Pontus Jansson allowing the 2018 World Cup finalists to snatch the points in a soaking Zagreb.Defender Jansson dawdled under a high ball into the penalty area with six minutes remaining and allowed Ivan Perisic to nip in behind. The Inter Milan winger then squared the ball for Andrej Kramaric to tap in from close range.Sweden are stuck on no points after losing all three of their matches.Elsewhere, Italy stretched their unbeaten streak to 18 matches and held onto top spot in League A, Group 1 with a stalemate in Gdansk.New Juventus signing Federico Chiesa missed the chance to win the match for the dominant Azzurri from close range in the 11th minute.Roberto Mancini's side are one point ahead of the Netherlands, who also drew 0-0 with Bosnia and Herzegovina, ahead of their meeting in Bergamo on Wednesday.England manager Gareth Southgate said his side showed what they were made of after coming from behind to beat Belgium 2-1 and move top of League A, Group 2 earlier on Sunday.The Three Lions are on seven points, one ahead of the world's top-ranked side after Marcus Rashford's spot-kick and Mason Mount's deflected winner 25 minutes from time cancelled out Romelu Lukaku's early penalty."We are not going to face a more difficult game defensively," said Southgate. "That is the beauty of the Nations League, you get games against this level of opponent."It's a great experience for them and to go and win it, (it) should give them a sense of what might be possible in the next few years."Denmark are three points behind England in third after their simple 3-0 win over bottom side Iceland.In League B, Erling Braut Haaland showed what the rescheduled Euro 2020 will be missing after he slammed home a hat-trick to help Norway to a 4-0 thrashing of Romania.Haaland struck in the 13th, 64th and 74th minutes as Norway moved level on six points with group leaders Austria, 1-0 winners at Northern Ireland.Norway were knocked out of the Euros playoffs by Serbia on Thursday.Portugal and Italy kept hold of first place in their UEFA Nations League groups on Sunday with goalless draws against France and Poland respectively on a night of little drama, while England saw off Belgium to take the initiative in their pool.There was little to talk about at the Stade de France as a star-studded line-up of players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann failed to muster much of a spectacle in the League A, Group 3 match.One-thousand fans gathered in the cavernous stadium just outside Paris to watch France host the reigning European champions, but were treated to just four shots on target as two rugged defenses cancelled out each team's attacks."We didn't score a goal, but we weren't here to score goals," said Portugal coach Fernando Santos.

We've played so many times, one day one wins, another day the other wins."Djokovic had won five Grand Slam finals in a row since being beaten by Stan Wawrinka at the 2016 Australian Open, but Nadal was not upset on his turf despite a new stadium design, the roof and the lack of spectators amid the COVID-19 crisis.The 34-year-old Nadal would not think of matching Federer's mark."To win here means everything.

Rally driver Safina Khan has battled critics to ensure women are represented and leads by example.Safina Khan was introduced to Motorsport as a young girl. She did not need to look far for inspiration."It's quite interesting Simon, I actually got into it because of my dad. My father was actually one of the people who was the top most mechanic in the Nissan rally team that time which used to come from Japan to Kenya just to participate in our Safari Rally. so I used to follow him around, he used to take me around on his servicing, when the cars used to come, when they used to go testing, so that is I think when the first bug bit me," says Safina Khan, rally driver.Safina was totally hooked to the "dangerous sport" when she saw an all female crew take part in the iconic Safari Rally."The person who actually sealed the deal for me was when I saw Michelle Mouton and Fabrizia Pons participating in the Safari Rally and I said to myself hey if these ladies can take part in such a powerful machine they were driving an Audi, and a Lancia, Why can't I be part of this one day and the thing which helped me was the fact that I was interested in mechanics so I used to help my dad building the engines doing the servicing and stuff like that at a very young age so I said to myself all I have to do is just follow my passion and that is what I did."Sadly, her chosen career in rallying exposed Safina to ridicule and criticism in a male-dominated sport."But it was a very hard journey I had a lot of naysayers they turned round and said you are going to go and die these cars are going to roll, you will be nowhere to be seen and a woman your place is in the kitchen what are you doing out there that is a man's sport and I said to them no you know what, what the man can do we can do because in the long run we are all humans," Safina submits.Determined to beat all odds and gender discrimination, Safina literary forced her way into the sport."I actually stowed away in one of an auto-cross car that my dad was participating in, in Solai track in Nakuru, I hid the organizers did not see me and when they discovered I was already in the car and we are already on the circuit well its another thing that they had to stop the race just to tell my dad to get me out of the car but then like I said that time I was bitten. From that event I basically continued with school because my father put his foot down and said education first so i had to get back into school and do what I had to do."Upon finishing, school a call came through that changed her life."Then one day I got a call out of the blues from a lady called Michelle, she is also a Kenyan and she asked me whether I was interested in rallying. An our first car was actually a Subaru GC8 we formed a team called ladies luck rally team and we were both Kenyans participating in the circuit in  a subaru Imprezza we did our first rally .... in 1998 that's when we did our first Safari it was very hard. In those day's it was actually a 3,000km event.Since then, Safina has gone on to win 5 coupe de dames trophies in the Safari rally, an Award given for the highest finishing all female crew.She was also crowned as the Kenya Autocross champion in 2018. But her golden moment came when she heard the Kenyan anthem played in Uganda after a stunning performance from her team ladies luck."It was a very important race for us, we started off in the 30's and we actually finished in the top 5 among the top end cars, just me and my driver Michelle, we were the top placed Kenyans. you can imagine the feeling we had when we had our flag across our bonnet, the bonnet of our car, we were taken to the ramp and they played for us our national anthem we actually cried we had tears in our eyes. you know you feel so proud to be Kenyan and to be bringing home the trophies in an alien country or in another country.

For a lot of fighters, one solid hit in the form of a loss is enough to derail them. Ronda Rousey never recovered from Holly Holm; Chris Weidman, who was 13-0 in 2015, has gone a grim 5-2 since his loss to Luke Rockhold; Jose Aldo had his soul taken by a Conor McGregor 13-second KO following 10 years undefeated.In the UFC's current bantamweight division, Cory Sandhagen was one of the top prospects. He entered the UFC with a 7-1 record as a lightweight, but quickly went down to bantam and found himself on a five fight win streak over top guys in his weight class such as John Lineker and Raphael Assuncao. This put him in a championship eliminator against Aljamain Sterling at UFC 250 on June 6 this year.Sandhagen was tapped out in under 90 seconds. It seemed he hadn't planned at all for the smaller cage at the UFC APEX Facility and found himself immediately swallowed up by Sterling who grappled, took his back and then locked in a rear naked choke from a standing position, almost as if he were a human rucksack.He already has a loss on his record, but a unanimous decision is very different to this, the kind of fast, definitive and borderline embarrassing loss that can ruin a fighter, particularly when they are on such a commanding hot streak.His next fight, which took place today at UFC Fight Island 5 against Marlon Moraes, would show if this were a blip or a sign Sandhagen had already peaked. Having lost to then-champion Henry Cejudo at UFC 239 on June 8, 2019, Moraes knew he needed a solid win to get another crack at the belt. He got his win against the aforementioned Aldo at UFC 245 at the end of that year; sadly, that feat doesn't mean much anymore and it looked as if he had spent five rounds sparring with a human punch bag instead of actually fighting.It made sense to match him with Sandhagen and find out who is next in line once #1 Sterling finally faces new champion Petr Yan.Sandhagen, significantly taller and with a longer reach than his Brazilian opponent, began Round 1 by intentionally keeping a distance. Any time Moraes attempted a range-finding jab or one of his trademark football volley-esque leg kicks, he shimmied back. When Sandhagen did engage, it was to maintain this gap; he leaned into his jabs to keep his fist as far away from his body as possible.After two minutes he began engaging in earnest, only, again, due to his height and focus on keeping out of Moraes' danger zone, Sandhagen's leg kicks had him dipping so low, it was as if he were attempting the low sweep from Mortal Kombat. Moraes, not known for his patience, swung for the fences.Sandhagen avoided each and it looked like the round was in the can already, but with two minutes left, it started to look like a high-level ploy. Any time Moraes missed, Sandhagen would close in and start attacking, bringing him close enough for a brawl. Unfortunately, Moraes' reliance on hitting hard rather than hitting fast meant he took more damage than he gave.According to UFCstats.com, Moraes landed 12 significant strikes in the first frame, less than half of Sandhagen's 30. Worse still, Sandhagen's incredible variety meant an almost even spread between the head, body and legs with 11, eight and 11 respectively. Moraes landed two leg kicks and the rest of his offense went to the head.Going into Round 2, Sandhagen knew that his fight plan was working and also that Moraes' wasn't. This confidence was clear as he sprinted to the middle of the Octagon to begin. He peppered Moraes with tap-tap jabs and then followed with harder punches and even a front kick when the Brazilian tried to fight back.With 4:32 remaining in the round, Sandhagen hit a question mark kick that smacked Moraes directly above his right eye. As Moraes recovered, Sandhagen could be heard shouting "his orbital's broke," referring to the orbital bone around the eye that had just been hit and barely 20 seconds later, he hit that bone again with a beautiful spinning heel kick for a TKO win.Cool, calm and clinical. In just over six minutes, Sandhagen turned the Sterling loss from a possible derailment to barely even registering as a blip.In the words of boxing legend Rocky Balboa, "it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." For a lot of fighters, one solid hit in the form of a loss is enough to derail them. Ronda Rousey never recovered from Holly Holm; Chris Weidman, who was 13-0 in 2015, has gone a grim 5-2 since his loss to Luke Rockhold; Jose Aldo had his soul taken by a Conor McGregor 13-second KO following 10 years undefeated.In the UFC's current bantamweight division, Cory Sandhagen was one of the top prospects. He entered the UFC with a 7-1 record as a lightweight, but quickly went down to bantam and found himself on a five fight win streak over top guys in his weight class such as John Lineker and Raphael Assuncao. This put him in a championship eliminator against Aljamain Sterling at UFC 250 on June 6 this year.Sandhagen was tapped out in under 90 seconds. It seemed he hadn't planned at all for the smaller cage at the UFC APEX Facility and found himself immediately swallowed up by Sterling who grappled, took his back and then locked in a rear naked choke from a standing position, almost as if he were a human rucksack.He already has a loss on his record, but a unanimous decision is very different to this, the kind of fast, definitive and borderline embarrassing loss that can ruin a fighter, particularly when they are on such a commanding hot streak.His next fight, which took place today at UFC Fight Island 5 against Marlon Moraes, would show if this were a blip or a sign Sandhagen had already peaked. Having lost to then-champion Henry Cejudo at UFC 239 on June 8, 2019, Moraes knew he needed a solid win to get another crack at the belt. He got his win against the aforementioned Aldo at UFC 245 at the end of that year; sadly, that feat doesn't mean much anymore and it looked as if he had spent five rounds sparring with a human punch bag instead of actually fighting.It made sense to match him with Sandhagen and find out who is next in line once #1 Sterling finally faces new champion Petr Yan.Sandhagen, significantly taller and with a longer reach than his Brazilian opponent, began Round 1 by intentionally keeping a distance. Any time Moraes attempted a range-finding jab or one of his trademark football volley-esque leg kicks, he shimmied back. When Sandhagen did engage, it was to maintain this gap; he leaned into his jabs to keep his fist as far away from his body as possible.After two minutes he began engaging in earnest, only, again, due to his height and focus on keeping out of Moraes' danger zone, Sandhagen's leg kicks had him dipping so low, it was as if he were attempting the low sweep from Mortal Kombat. Moraes, not known for his patience, swung for the fences.Sandhagen avoided each and it looked like the round was in the can already, but with two minutes left, it started to look like a high-level ploy. Any time Moraes missed, Sandhagen would close in and start attacking, bringing him close enough for a brawl. Unfortunately, Moraes' reliance on hitting hard rather than hitting fast meant he took more damage than he gave.According to UFCstats.com, Moraes landed 12 significant strikes in the first frame, less than half of Sandhagen's 30. Worse still, Sandhagen's incredible variety meant an almost even spread between the head, body and legs with 11, eight and 11 respectively. Moraes landed two leg kicks and the rest of his offense went to the head.Going into Round 2, Sandhagen knew that his fight plan was working and also that Moraes' wasn't. This confidence was clear as he sprinted to the middle of the Octagon to begin. He peppered Moraes with tap-tap jabs and then followed with harder punches and even a front kick when the Brazilian tried to fight back.With 4:32 remaining in the round, Sandhagen hit a question mark kick that smacked Moraes directly above his right eye.

In just over six minutes, Sandhagen turned the Sterling loss from a possible derailment to barely even registering as a blip.When Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski missed out on the chance to win his first Ballon d'Or after the prestigious award was cancelled for the first time since 1956 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland was shocked.As one of the most recognizable Polish stars in the world, Lewandowski was favorite to receive the honor after netting incredible 55 goals in 47 games and helping Bayern win the UEFA Champions League, Super Cup, Bundesliga and German Cup last season. However, the organizers' controversial decision to write off the campaign's achievement broke the 32-year-old and his compatriots' heart."We won everything we could with Bayern. I was the top scorer in all competitions I featured in and I think a player who achieves this would win the Ballon d'Or," a clearly frustrated Lewandowski told Polish reporters back in August.Like many others in the footballing world, he thought he has been robbed of the 2020 Ballon d'Or.Fortunately, nobody could rob Iga Swiatek of the tennis world's biggest trophy. The 19-year-old Polish girl, who arrived in Paris ranked 54 in the world, defied the odds to win the French Open after overwhelming Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin in the final on Saturday.As the youngest women's French Open winner since 1992, Swiatek became the first Pole to win a Grand Slam singles title, eclipsing the run of Polish legend Jadwiga Jedrzejowska, who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939.Lewandowski was among the first to offer congratulations as the whole Poland erupted into celebration. "What an amazing success, what a great story! Good job, Iga Swiatek," he beamed on Twitter.The exhilaration was shared by tennis star Agnieszka Radwanska, who is the first Polish player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam singles final in 2012, when he stormed into the Wimbledon Championships final and lost to Serena Williams."Congratulations, Iga Swiatek! A fabulous showing for tennis," Radwanska posted on Instagram.Poland's President Andrzej Duda also expressed his public endorsement. "Great thanks and congratulations for Iga Swiatek! A historic day for Poland, for Polish sport and for Polish tennis. Bravo!" he tweeted.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also followed suit, tweeting "Huge congratulations to Iga Swiatek, who has achieved today the success of her life and â I am convinced â just the first success in the Grand Slam. Amazing story written by this young girl on the Roland Garros courts! Paris is Polish today!"Seven-time Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander was equally optimistic about the teenager's bright future. "Iga looked so relieved but also calm, she is going to win so many more â you can see that in her demeanor throughout the whole finals," he said via Eurosport.He was echoed by former British No.1 Tim Henman, who told the Guardian: "Her mentality is so strong when she is so young. Those three elements, the physical, technical and mental are all so important and you see her athletic ability, too.""When you reflect on her mentality, how calm she's been, her sense of belonging she's had out on court, it's been incredible all the way through. When you add it all up â 28 games she lost to win a grand slam in seven matches â it's just been a complete domination. She's such a deserving champion."Facing a deluge of congratulatory messages, Swiatek exuded confidence and calm. "I know it's going to be crazy. I think I'm going to get used to that, it's not going to be a problem for me," the Warsaw native said in his post-game interview."I didn't have problem with, like, getting attention, with people surrounding me. I think it's going to be okay for me. I really appreciate all the support I got during whole two weeks. I know that the whole country was behind me and they all believed in me. I'm going to be happy and proud," she noted.Seven of the past eight grand slam titles have been won by players under the age of 23, and Swiatek knows that the new generation of tennis players need to be more ruthless and consistent if they want to achieve dominance in this sport."I know my game isn't developed perfectly," she observed. "Also I think the biggest change for me is going to be to be consistent. I think this is what women's tennis is struggling with.""That's why we have so many new Grand Slam winners because we are not as consistent as Rafa, Roger, and Novak. That's why my goal is going to be to be consistent. It's going to be really hard to achieve that," she added.Swiatek's path to the French Open titleFirst round: beat Marketa Vondrousova  6-1, 6-2Second round: beat Hsieh Su-Wei 6-1, 6-4Third round: beat Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-2Fourth round: beat Simona Halep 6-1, 6-2Quarterfinal: beat Martina Trevisan 6-3, 6-1Semifinal: beat Nadia Podoroska 6-2, 6-1Final: beat Sofia Kenin 6-4, 6-1When Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski missed out on the chance to win his first Ballon d'Or after the prestigious award was cancelled for the first time since 1956 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland was shocked.As one of the most recognizable Polish stars in the world, Lewandowski was favorite to receive the honor after netting incredible 55 goals in 47 games and helping Bayern win the UEFA Champions League, Super Cup, Bundesliga and German Cup last season.

His reaggravated heel injury somehow became an Archilles Heel for both the team and himself, unable to lift the trophy with a 4-1 in the series on Friday, but instead, losing to the Heat 108-111.Davis looked painful on the floor, clutching his lower right ankle, and stayed on the bench for the rest of the quarter. His heel problem was already obvious in Game 3, the first game the Lakers lost in the series, in which Davis had 15 points and five rebounds, his worst in this Finals. The Lakers still lead the series 3-2. LeBron James was disappointed for not winning the title on Friday, saying they have to "be better at Game 6 and close the series."The Lakers had a three-point lead midway through the final quarter of Game 5 and let it get away. They led by one after a basket by Davis with 21.8 seconds left and were one stop from winning the title; Davis ended up fouling Butler, a call the Lakers said shouldn't have been made. The NBA disagreed Saturday, saying Butler was fouled on the play."We're motivated to win Game 6 and they are motivated to win Game 6," Davis said.

It is so often right now that it is crazy," said Swiatek, who captured her first tour title in the process."I don't know what's going on. It's overwhelming for me, it's crazy."Two years ago I won a junior Grand Slam (at Wimbledon) and now I'm here. It feels like such a short time," she said.Swiatek is the youngest women's French Open winner since Monica Seles lifted the trophy as an 18-year-old in 1992. She is the first teenage champion since Iva Majoli in 1997."It's crazy for me because I watched Rafael Nadal lift the trophy every year and now I'm in the same place," added Swiatek, the first woman to secure the title without losing a set since Justine Henin in 2007.Swiatek also became just the second unseeded women's Roland Garros champion in the Open era, joining Jelena Ostapenko who claimed a shock title three years ago.  She eclipsed the run of compatriot Jadwiga Jedrzejowska â the most outstanding Polish player of the interwar period â who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939. Swiatek was only the second Polish woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open era after Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon in 2012. She had never previously been beyond the last 16.Australian Open champion Kenin, 21, fell short in her attempt to become the first woman to capture two Slams in the same year since Angelique Kerber in 2016."I just want to congratulate Iga on a great tournament and a great match.

The referees only remove their masks to announce penalties. The NFL fined five coaches $100,000 each -- and their teams $250,000 -- for failing to wear masks properly in the early weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the New York Jets sent their team and coaches home on Friday as a precaution after a player received a presumed positive COVID-19 test result. The Jets, who are scheduled to host the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, will work virtually for the rest of the day and the player will be re-tested. The NFL, which is entering the fifth week of its 2020 schedule, has already pushed back a pair of games originally set for Sunday after a number of positive COVID-19 tests among players and personnel on multiple teams. As a result, the New England Patriots' home game versus the Denver Broncos has been pushed back to Monday, while the Tennessee Titans game against the visiting Buffalo Bills is scheduled for Tuesday. (With input from Reuters)Any coach who approaches a referee without wearing a proper face covering now can be slapped with a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. It is a response to complaints from the NFL Referees Association about coaches and other sideline personnel pulling down their masks to yell at officials from close range. "We have seen multiple occasions where head coaches have removed their masks to communicate with game officials during games," Perry Fewell, the NFL's senior vice president of officiating administration, wrote in the memo. "Doing so creates unnecessary, increased risk for the game official, the head coach, and others, and is inconsistent with the requirement that face coverings be worn at all times. ..."The league's COVID-19 protocols require everyone on the sideline to wear a face covering except for players who are actively involved in the game.

opening 2022 World Cup qualifier on Friday.Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos also got on the scoresheet while star forward Neymar set up two goals in a totally one-sided encounter that sent Brazil top of the South American qualifying table.In a Corinthians Arena deserted due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bolivia showed almost no ambition as Brazil dominated throughout, with PSG's Neymar starting after overcoming a back problem.Inside the first minute, winger Everton volleyed wide from inside the six-yard box and three minutes later his cross was headed off-target by Marquinhos from a similar position.Bolivia couldn't get out of their half, or on the ball, as Coutinho and Everton created a slew of chances down Brazil's left.The pressure told on 16 minutes as Marquinhos headed home from an identical position to his earlier chance as full-back Danilo swung over a cross from the right following a short corner.Even a first half downpour couldn't dampen Brazil's thrust as Coutinho forced a diving one-handed save from goalkeeper Carlos Lampe with a deflected shot.At times it looked like a handball game with Brazil camped on the edge of Bolivia's box, and the visitors keeping 10 men behind the ball at all times.But on the half hour, left-back Renan Lodi got in behind the defense and his cross from the left was turned home from barely a yard out by Firmino.Lampe made a fine one-handed save from a Casemiro free-kick and then smothered a close range finish by Neymar.By the end of the first half, Bolivia had had less than 20 percent possession and their only shot at goal was a free-kick from 40 yards by Fernando Salidas that didn't even beat the wall.If there were still any doubts Brazil would stroll to victory, they were dispelled three minutes into the second period when a sublime pass from Neymar presented Firmino with a tap-in from six yards.On 65 minutes, a cross from Coutinho flew into the net off the unlucky Jose Carrasco's chest.Coutinho then got on the scoresheet heading home a cross from Neymar from six yards.Neymar's attempts to join retired great Ronaldo as Brazil's second highest scorer of all time were frustrated by an offside flag and an injury time save by Lampe.In the night's other match, Atalanta pair Duvan Zapata and Luis Muriel fired Colombia to a 3-0 win over Venezuela.Zapata slid in a

was originally scheduled for early March, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organizers to postpone it to October. However, as several countries still raised concerns over the deadly virus, the tournament was again delayed until November 18.Qatar proved its ability to provide a safe environment for elite competition after the country managed to host the West Zone games for the AFC Champions League without a hitch. Earlier this month, Iranian giants Persepolis were crowned Western champions in Doha after overwhelming Saudi powerhouse Al Nassr 5-3 on penalties. Persepolis will take on the Eastern representative in a single-leg final, which is set to be played on December 19. According to AFC, the venue for the final will be confirmed in due course."We are extremely grateful for the outstanding support of the QFA and are pleased that we can now build on the success of the AFC Champions League (West) while looking forward to the remaining exciting matches in Asia's premier club competition," said Dato' Windsor John, the AFC General Secretary."Everything from the arrival of the teams, the efficient immigration process, the rigorous health screenings, hotels with biosecurity measures, to the state-of-the-art training facilities and stadiums were of the highest possible standard as the AFC insisted that the welfare and well-being of the players, officials and match officials was our top priority," he added.Among four teams from the Chinese Super League, only Beijing Guoan had a single outing, pulling off a 1-0 win over Chiangrai United in Thailand back in February.

Sunday will be their 56th clash."This is the house of Rafa," said Djokovic. "I will have the motivation to win, I beat him here in 2015 but this will be the biggest challenge â playing Nadal on clay."Djokovic hailed Tsitsipas, who was appearing in the semi-final of a Slam for only the second time."Stefanos is a big player but after four hours he was tired. He gave me a lot of trouble. I looked calm on the surface but it was a different story inside," added Djokovic who will be in his 27th Slam final.Djokovic took a 5-1 career lead over Tsitsipas into the semi-final and showing no signs of the neck and shoulder injury which blighted his performance against Pablo Carreno Busta in the last eight, he secured the only break of the opener in the second game.Crucially, he saved all five break points he faced.That became seven from seven early in the second set and he made Tsitsipas pay, breaking for a 3-2 edge and backing it up with another for 5-2.The 22-year-old Greek, appearing in his first French Open semi-final, just couldn't make Djokovic crack.An eighth break point came and went in the second game of the third set with Djokovic breaking for 5-4.Having saved two more break points, Djokovic was unable to convert a match point in the 10th game, picked up a time violation and, unsettled by the call as well as disturbances in the crowd, was broken at the 11th time of asking.From the brink of a quick exit, Tsitsipas stayed alive, taking the third set 7-5.Djokovic squandered 10 break points in the fourth set as Tsitsipas, who had also been two sets down in his opening match against Jaume Munar, levelled the match.However, in a final twist and as the clock ticked closer to the four-hour mark, Tsitsipas faded away in the decider, dropping serve twice to hand Djokovic a 4-1 lead.He saved another match point but was powerless on the third as Djokovic fired a clean winner.For 34-year-old Nadal, his win over Schwartzman was his 99th at Roland Garros.He is into his 28th final at the majors and has not dropped a set in the tournament this year."It's always incredible to play here and this is a very special moment," said Nadal after a 10th win in 11 matches against Schwartzman who had shocked him in Rome last month."I played a couple of bad points in the third set but Diego is a very tough player.

Is not easy playing them five sets because you have to play your best tennis maybe for three, four hours, five hours. Physically it's very hard," he admitted.(With input from agencies)Novak Djokovic set up a blockbuster French Open title showdown with Rafael Nadal on Friday after a dramatic five-set semi-final victory over Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas.World number one Djokovic, the 2016 champion at Roland Garros, reached his fifth final in Paris, defeating fifth seed Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1 in a roller-coaster of a contest where he had held a match point in the third set.Nadal, the 12-time champion, defeated Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0) to make a 13th final at the tournament.On Sunday, Djokovic can win an 18th major and become the first man in half a century to win all four Slams twice.Nadal, the world number two, can equal Roger Federer's all-time record of 20 Grand Slam title wins.Djokovic is one of only two men to have defeated Nadal at Roland Garros in 15 years. Sunday will be their 56th clash."This is the house of Rafa," said Djokovic. "I will have the motivation to win, I beat him here in 2015 but this will be the biggest challenge â playing Nadal on clay."Djokovic hailed Tsitsipas, who was appearing in the semi-final of a Slam for only the second time."Stefanos is a big player but after four hours he was tired. He gave me a lot of trouble. I looked calm on the surface but it was a different story inside," added Djokovic who will be in his 27th Slam final.Djokovic took a 5-1 career lead over Tsitsipas into the semi-final and showing no signs of the neck and shoulder injury which blighted his performance against Pablo Carreno Busta in the last eight, he secured the only break of the opener in the second game.Crucially, he saved all five break points he faced.That became seven from seven early in the second set and he made Tsitsipas pay, breaking for a 3-2 edge and backing it up with another for 5-2.The 22-year-old Greek, appearing in his first French Open semi-final, just couldn't make Djokovic crack.An eighth break point came and went in the second game of the third set with Djokovic breaking for 5-4.Having saved two more break points, Djokovic was unable to convert a match point in the 10th game, picked up a time violation and, unsettled by the call as well as disturbances in the crowd, was broken at the 11th time of asking.From the brink of a quick exit, Tsitsipas stayed alive, taking the third set 7-5.Djokovic squandered 10 break points in the fourth set as Tsitsipas, who had also been two sets down in his opening match against Jaume Munar, levelled the match.However, in a final twist and as the clock ticked closer to the four-hour mark, Tsitsipas faded away in the decider, dropping serve twice to hand Djokovic a 4-1 lead.He saved another match point but was powerless on the third as Djokovic fired a clean winner.For 34-year-old Nadal, his win over Schwartzman was his 99th at Roland Garros.He is into his 28th final at the majors and has not dropped a set in the tournament this year."It's always incredible to play here and this is a very special moment," said Nadal after a 10th win in 11 matches against Schwartzman who had shocked him in Rome last month."I played a couple of bad points in the third set but Diego is a very tough player. He probably makes more breaks on the tour than others.""It's different playing against Djokovic, Federer, Rafa, these guys. Is not easy playing them five sets because you have to play your best tennis maybe for three, four hours, five hours.

It was Schwartzman's first win against Nadal in 10 meetings.However, this time round, the Spaniard held his own against a determined Schwartzman who did his best to push him, even forcing the third set into a tie-break.Nadal, who is yet to drop a set at this year's tournament, is now into his 13th French Open final. He has never lost in the semi-final or final of the tournament.Nadal will face either Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday's final as he bids for a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title.(With input from agencies)Spain's Rafael Nadal progressed to the French Open final following a comfortable win over Argentine Diego Schwartzman on Friday.Nadal, a 12-time champion at Roland Garros, won 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 on Court Philippe Chatrier.Despite Nadal's dominance on clay, the build-up to the match had been made interesting after Schwartzman's stunning straight sets win over Nadal last month at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.

I always knew that if I would be in a Grand Slam final, it would be at the French Open," Swiatek said on court after becoming the first Polish woman to reach the Roland Garros final in 81 years and the first at any major since Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon eight years ago.She managed to hit through the court well, both off the forehand and backhand, and painted the red clay with winners, amassing 23 during another typical performance at a tournament in which she also snapped top seed Simona Halep's 17-match winning run.Unable to put up much resistance, Podoroska decided to show more aggression and started coming forward to cut down the time for Swiatek to hit her big shots.Swiatek, who also plays in a doubles semi-final on Friday, kept up the tempo and raced to a 4-0 lead before nervous errors allowed Podoroska to avoid a second-set bagel with a break of serve.The Pole, who has lost only 23 games in six matches, broke back immediately, however, and ended Podoroska's ordeal on the first match point with an unreturned serve. Fourth seed Kenin, who beat Spain's Garbine Muguruza to win the Australian Open in February, proved too solid for the 30-year-old Kvitova who had not lost a set en route to her first French Open semi-final since 2012.A mixture of crafty shot placement, superb defense and some scorching backhand winners, combined with too many Kvitova mistakes, put Kenin in command and her only wobble came when she served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but was broken.When she got a second chance to serve it out at 6-5, however, the American could not be denied as Kvitova fired a forehand wide on match point â a shot that rather summed up the Czech's performance."I had tough matches these past two weeks.

He measures 170cm (5ft 7in) and is the same height as Ken Rosewall, who won the last of his eight Grand Slam titles in 1972. Apart from the great Australian, no one of that height or less, has won one of the tennis season's four major tournaments â the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open â since 1968, when the sport allowed professionals to enter.Schwartzman is thriving in a world of giants â he is 41cm (1ft 3in) shorter than the tallest Top 50 player, Reilly Opelka, who is 211cm (6ft 11in) â but why is height such a big thing in tennis?  Who is Diego Schwartzman?Named after legendary soccer player Diego Maradona â another sporting superstar from Argentina â Schwartzman always knew he wasnât going to be the traditional height for a tennis player. His childhood nickname is El Peque â a Spanish slang term that roughly translates as "shorty" in English."I have worse problems than being 10 centimeters shorter than everybody else," Schwartzman has said in the past. "When I walk onto a tennis court, I don't think about how tall I am or how much bigger my opponent is. I know there is a difference, but so what?"He has won three ATP singles titles and reached a career-high singles ranking of 11 in June 2018. Before reaching the last four in Paris, his best Grand Slam result was getting to the quarter-finals of the US Open in 2017. He recently beat semi-final opponent Nadal in the Italian Open.  Why is height important in tennis?Itâs partly a question of physics. The taller a player is, the heavier they are and therefore the harder they can hit the ball. It generally means longer arms, which generate more power and afford extra reach, rotation and racket head speed. The crucial advantage, however, is on the serve. Hitting the serve from a greater height means the stroke can be hit harder and with a downward trajectory to make the ball bounce higher on the opponentâs side of the court. The extra height also gives taller players a great margin of error because they have more angles to play with from the point at which the ball is struck.  Have professional players got taller?Definitely. In 1968, when professionals were allowed to enter the major tournaments, the average height of a Grand Slam winner was 176cm (5ft 7in). By 2019, that figure had risen steadily to 186.5cm (6ft 1in). Rosewall was the first Grand Slam champion of the Open era and is also its shortest, the same 170cm height as Schwartzman. The tallest are Juan Martin del Potro and Marin Cilic, the 2009 and 2014 US Open champions respectively, who measure 198cm (6ft 6in).It is not just the champions, the situation is repeating itself across the professional tennis tour. At the end of the 1960s, the average height of a Top 20 player was 181.2cm (5ft 9in). By the end of last year it was 187.5cm (6ft 1in) and the figure is still rising. The average height of the current ATP Top 50 is 188.6cm (6ft 2in) and there are more players taller than 190cm â including two, Opelka and John Isner, topping 200cm (6ft 7in) â than ever before."I think players like me, around my height, are going to be extinct," says the recently retired David Ferrer, who measures 180cm (5ft 9in).The women's game is experiencing a similar trend towards taller players, beginning with Martina Navratilova. The Williams sisters, Petra Kvitova, Maria Sharapova â all 180cm (5ft 9in) or taller â have dominated recent decades in the way that Billie Jean King and Chris Evert dominated the 1960s and 1970s. Both were under 168cm (5ft 6in). How has Schwartzman managed to defy the general rule?By playing to his strengths. Shorter players have a lower center of gravity and better movement around the court. What Schwartzman lacks in power and reach, he more than makes up for in agility and guile. Taller players also tend to tire more easily, because of the extra weight they have to carry around the court, and Schwartzman's endurance is a big asset. Five-set matches, as he showed against the higher ranked Dominic Thiem in Paris, don't worry him.He is also known as one of the, if not the, best returners of serve â he breaks serve regularly in his matches. But the question is whether he can hang on to his own service games to win the big matches. So is there an ideal height for a tennis champion?There have been a wide range of heights of tennis champions. But the current "Big Three" of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are tightly bunched between 185cm and 188cm (6ft 1in). They have dominated for more than 15 years between them. They are in the sweet spot of being tall enough to have some kind of height advantage, but not too tall to hamper their speed around the court and their endurance.Many of the next generation of youngsters coming through â Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Matteo Berrettini and Daniil Medvedev among them â are over 190cm (6ft 2in), but work hard to ensure their movement is not compromised. Zverev played field hockey as a junior to improve his movement and changes of direction in a low-gravity sport. That may suggest the height trend is set to continue.But the final word can be left to Schwartzman, who told reporters after a French Open win over 208cm (6ft 8in) Kevin Anderson in 2018: "I read David and Goliath when I was young in the school, and I just try to think of that when I see Kevin or the guys who are two meters."It's a spirit that has been serving him well two years on.Video editor and graphics: Paula HarveyThe author is a former Level 4 tennis coach, who has worked with regional and national players in the UK. When Diego Schwartzman beat Dominic Thiem to reach the semi-finals of the French Open in a five-hour-plus epic, the Argentine came a step closer to tennis history. Not just because the 28-year-old had reached his first Grand Slam semi-final â against Rafael Nadal, the 12-time Roland Garros champion â but because Schwartzman would equal the record for the shortest player in the Open era to win a major were he to lift the trophy in Paris on Sunday.Schwartzman is the shortest player in the ATP Tour's top 50.

It was the first national diving competition since January this year.Three Rio Olympics gold medalists Chen Aisen, Shi Tingmao and Ren Qian along with world champions Wang Han and Zhang Jiaqi were joined with 150 other divers at the national event.Staged at the newly constructed Hebei Olympic Sports Center Swimming and Diving Hall, the event was the first leg of the Chinese diving national team's tryouts for the Tokyo Olympic Games which have been disrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic."To restart our tryouts for the Tokyo Olympics, we wiped out the points divers accumulated in previous tryouts and only had them for reference use," said Zhou Jihong, president of the Chinese Swimming Association."That aside, divers also have to adjust to the difficulties with switching venues and fierce nationwide competitions. For them, it is a lot of pressure."Dubbed as the "dream team" with a total of 40 Olympic gold medals in its pocket, the Chinese diving team has maintained the world's highest caliber throughout the years. Despite the inevitable change of hands from the old generation to the young, the team kept its unbeaten streak at the Olympics as well as World Championships with new stars popping up. And it was still the case at this national event. Quan Hongchan, 13, from Guangdong Province delivered a stunning five-round performance at the women's 10-meter platform to claim the gold. She widened the gap against world champion Zhang Jiaqi after the latter had an average third-round diving and maintained her high-quality diving till the very end to top the podium.In a post-game interview, she said she had not thought of defeating a few world champions on the platform."I just follow my coaches' instructions to take the competition as training. To be bold and just go jumping," said Quan.World champion Zhang Jiaqi finished second with 409.10 points, a point enough to outrank foreign players in international competitions."I feel a little bit disappointed because I feel I have more experience and my techniques are much mature than her but I still lost," said Zhang, who was at the top of the podium four years ago at the same competition."I have accepted my defeat but I will keep competing."The star-dubbed men's 10-meter platform on Tuesday featured two Olympic champions as well as four world champions as the 20-year-old Lian Junjie came from behind to outscore Yang Jian in the last jump to finish top at the podium.It was the first time he jumped 409C action with a difficulty of 4.1 in formal competition as he only started to practice it in January."Starting in January, we've been training with the national team and the efforts seem to have paid off," said Lian."I only tried this action for a few times during tests but never in competitions. I'm quite happy with my performance."The points Lian scored at the men's 10-meter platform, together with the scores Peng Jianfeng clocked at the men's one-meter springboard final, both surpassed the champion scores at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.Zhou Jihong spoke highly of divers' performances at this stop and according to her, the event will be joined with two other national championships in January and May next year to serve as the final reference for the national team's selection for the Tokyo Olympic Games."We should stay confident as everyone works hard, and we remain competitive," said Zhou. "As everything can happen when it comes to competitive sports, the only thing we can do is making sure we are doing our best."(Cover image: Yang Hao of Shaanxi competes during the men's 10-meter platform semifinal at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships in Shijiazhuang, north China's Hebei Province, October 6, 2020. /Xinhua)Young divers stunned the viewers while veterans maintained stable form at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships, which came to a successful close on Wednesday in north China's Hebei Province.

She widened the gap against world champion Zhang Jiaqi after the latter had an average third-round diving and maintained her high-quality diving till the very end to top the podium.In a post-game interview, she said she had not thought of defeating a few world champions on the platform."I just follow my coaches' instructions to take the competition as training. To be bold and just go jumping," said Quan.World champion Zhang Jiaqi finished second with 409.10 points, a point enough to outrank foreign players in international competitions."I feel a little bit disappointed because I feel I have more experience and my techniques are much mature than her but I still lost," said Zhang, who was at the top of the podium four years ago at the same competition."I have accepted my defeat but I will keep competing."The star-dubbed men's 10-meter platform on Tuesday featured two Olympic champions as well as four world champions as the 20-year-old Lian Junjie came from behind to outscore Yang Jian in the last jump to finish top at the podium.It was the first time he jumped 409C action with a difficulty of 4.1 in formal competition as he only started to practice it in January."Starting in January, we've been training with the national team and the efforts seem to have paid off," said Lian."I only tried this action for a few times during tests but never in competitions. I'm quite happy with my performance."The points Lian scored at the men's 10-meter platform, together with the scores Peng Jianfeng clocked at the men's one-meter springboard final, both surpassed the champion scores at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.Zhou Jihong spoke highly of divers' performances at this stop and according to her, the event will be joined with two other national championships in January and May next year to serve as the final reference for the national team's selection for the Tokyo Olympic Games."We should stay confident as everyone works hard, and we remain competitive," said Zhou. "As everything can happen when it comes to competitive sports, the only thing we can do is making sure we are doing our best."(Cover image: Yang Hao of Shaanxi competes during the men's 10-meter platform semifinal at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships in Shijiazhuang, north China's Hebei Province, October 6, 2020. /Xinhua)Formula One is set for a record-breaking weekend when the Nuerburgring hosts the first Eifel Grand Prix on Sunday, with six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton having a second go at matching Michael Schumacher's 91 career wins, while Kimi Raikkonen will line up for his 323rd Grand Prix start after equaling Brazilian Rubens Barrichello's record in Russia two weeks ago. The Finnish 'Iceman,' 40, made his Formula One debut with Sauber in 2001 and is now the oldest man in the race. "Record or not, I am approaching this weekend as any other because once you're in the car, it's pretty much the same," said Alfa Romeo driver Raikkonen, 2007 world champion with Ferrari. "It's not something I care about, not really," he added.

I know she plays really aggressive so I needed to have a better first serve percentage and play aggressive myself; I did a great job overall," said Kenin, who won four of her five matches at Roland Garros in three sets."I guess I like winning in three sets. I know it's tough but I'm getting the job done."After a solid start on both sides, Collins served a woeful double fault to hand Kenin the first break of the match, and a 3-2 lead.She held serve and set up another break point at 4-2 but Collins saved it to stay in contention.Kenin was, however, solid on her service games and she bagged the opening set when her opponent's return sailed wide.It was the first time Kenin took a set against Collins in four encounters, and the fourth seed kept her momentum, breaking again for 3-2 in the second set as her unseeded opponent smacked a forehand long.But this time, Collins hit back to level for 3-3 and she started to threaten Kenin's serve, eventually breaking again to level.The comeback was short-lived, though, as Collins quickly fell 4-0 behind in the decider before taking a medical timeout, holding her midriff as she went off the court for treatment before Kenin easily won the remaining two games.(Cover image: Sofia Kenin in action against Danielle Collins during their quarter-finals match on Court Philippe-Chatrier at the French Open in Paris, France, October 7, 2020. /VCG)Fourth seed Sofia Kenin claimed her maiden French Open semi-final spot as she fought to a 6-4 4-6 6-0 victory against fellow American Danielle Collins on Wednesday.The Australian Open champion was kept on her toes for two sets by an opponent who had beaten her in their previous encounters before strolling through the decider to set up a clash with Czech seventh seed Petra Kvitova.Collins was bothered by abdominal pains in the third set, looking unable to give her maximum effort in the finale on court Philippe Chatrier."This is really special, I'm super happy.

He was one of my favorite players, if not my most favored when I was a teenager," Giroud said in reference to the trophy-laden AC Milan legend.  "I'll just carry on and see how far it goes," the Chelsea star added. Now the only player stands in front of him is Thierry Henry, who leads with 51 goals in 123 caps. Judging by Giroud's current fine form, it won't be long before he surpasses the former Arsenal icon.Giroud is accustomed to keeping a low profile and sometimes doesn't get the appreciation he deserves, but he showed the burning fire of ambition when asked whether he was targeting Henry's record. "There's no limit. You have to set yourself goals," observed Giroud. "Let's see when I reach 46, 47 goals."  It was also a historic night for Eduardo Camavinga. The Rennes starlet became the youngest debutant since 1914 last month with an appearance off the bench against Croatia. On Wednesday, Camavinga made history again as he was given his first start in national team color by Didier Deschamps. The youngster duly repaid his coach's trust by delivering an audacious overhead flick for the opener, thus becoming the youngest player to score for France in 106 years. Barcelona striker Antoine Griezmann, PSG talisman Kylian Mbappe, and Bayern Munich's Corentin Tolisso were also on the scoresheet, capping off a wonderful outing for France. Meanwhile, in Lisbon, Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo failed to get off the mark with a goal despite a lively performance against Spain in front of about 2,500 home fans in the stands. The clash served as a test for Portuguese authorities, as 5 percent of the capacity of the Jose Alvalade Stadium was filled, with attendants sitting apart from each other and sticking to social distancing rules. With supporters cheering him on, Ronaldo had a golden chance to break the deadlock just before the hour mark, but the Juventus superstar hit the crossbar with a powerful shot from inside the area.  Atletico Madrid's Joao Felix, who replaced Ronaldo in the 73rd, nearly notched a later winner at the death but fluffed his lines. Before the match, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) announced that Spain and Portugal have signed an agreement to push ahead with their joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup.Spain hosted in World Cup once in 1982, but Portugal has never staged a World Cup before. "Few things can generate more hope and anticipation than the opportunity to organize a World Cup, and we can't think of a better companion than Portugal," said RFEF president Luis Rubiales in a statement. Elsewhere, Germany midfielder Florian Neuhaus scored on his debut, but Turkey came back three times to earn a 3-3 draw. It was Germany's third stalemate in a row and the third straight time that they have failed to win after taking the lead. "I'm disappointed and frustrated. We have had this problem for a while, and the same thing happened in other games," said Germany coach Joachim Low. In other games, Croatia won 2-1 away in Switzerland, while Italy thrashed Moldova 6-0.

After I found rhythm and confidence," Djokovic said afterwards on Court Philippe Chatrier on another damp and chilly night."It was important to stay focused.

He had already won the world cross country championship five months earlier.Up to Wednesday Cheptegei only had the 18th quickest time over the distance with a best in Doha of 26min 48.36secs, over half a minute outside the record.But his performance in August boded well and he was assisted by some rapid pacemakers, notably the Kenyan Nicholas Kimeli who was a world finalist over 5,000 meters, and electronic timing along the track.Another factor for the fan of Manchester United was his footwear, Nike's carbon-plated Nike Vaporfly worn by Ethiopia's Gidey when she ran the earlier 5,000 meters in 14 minutes 6.62 seconds.The 22-year-old was lowering the previous mark of 14min 11.15 held by her compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba since 2008 by over four seconds.Gidey put up the run of her short career a year after taking 10,000 meters silver at the world athletics championships in Doha.With two pacemakers helping her record bid until the 3,000 meters marker Gidey maintained a ferocious pace to etch her name in athletics' record books."I'm happy," said Gidey.

coronavirus-postponed Tokyo Olympics will be slashed by $280 million, organizers said Wednesday, touting a scaled-back, less flashy Games, with cuts to everything from staffing to pyrotechnics.But the final cost of the event -- officially budgeted before the pandemic at 1.3 trillion yen ($12 billion) -- remains unclear because additional expenses caused by the postponement have not yet been made public."Tokyo 2020 believes that this work will help to create a model for future global events including forthcoming Games amid the new normal in which we now live," organizers said in a statement after a presentation to the International Olympic Committee Executive Board. They said they would put out an updated budget, including additional costs linked to postponement and coronavirus counter-measures, by the end of the year. Plans for a lower-key event were unveiled in late September, with measures including fewer free tickets, scrapping athlete welcome ceremonies, and savings on banners, mascots and pyrotechnics. The final shape of the Games remains unclear, with questions including whether spectators will be allowed -- including foreign visitors -- yet to be resolved. The

players, coaches and non-sporting staff to adapt to the huge losses suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a club source said on Wednesday. Staff have been notified by the club of the need to reduce costs after posting a loss of 97 million euros ($113.98 million) in their annual financial report, released on Monday. The employees, including players, have been asked to nominate a representative over the next two weeks to represent them in the negotiations over the changes to their salaries, added the source. Like every major sporting competition, La Liga faced huge disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pausing for three months mid-season before completing the final rounds of fixtures without fans which hit income from ticket sales and merchandise. Barca's accounts on Wednesday made for grim reading, showing a 14 percent drop in revenue from the previous year and the doubling of their net debt to 488 million euros. The club enacted a temporary pay cut of 70 percent at the end of March in the height of the pandemic, lasting the duration of Spain's national state of alarm, which ended in June. Barca's financial troubles also led them to spend the close season lightening the biggest wage bill in European football, offloading Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal for next to nothing, while selling Arthur Melo for 72 million euros and Nelson Semedo for 30 million. They only brought in three players, Miralem Pjanic, Francisco Trincao and Sergino Dest for a combined 112 million euros. They failed to make any extra additions before the transfer window shut on Monday, despite showing interest in Manchester City defender Eric Garcia and Olympique Lyonnais forward Memphis Depay. Meanwhile, Spanish club Valencia did not sign any players in the transfer window due to a 100 million euros fall in revenue as a result of the coronavirus, despite letting eight key squad members leave in the close season. (With input from Reuters)Barcelona have begun a process to reduce the pay of players, coaches and non-sporting staff to adapt to the huge losses suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a club source said on Wednesday. Staff have been notified by the club of the need to reduce costs after posting a loss of 97 million euros ($113.98 million) in their annual financial report, released on Monday. The employees, including players, have been asked to nominate a representative over the next two weeks to represent them in the negotiations over the changes to their salaries, added the source. Like every major sporting competition, La Liga faced huge disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pausing for three months mid-season before completing the final rounds of fixtures without fans which hit income from ticket sales and merchandise. Barca's accounts on Wednesday made for grim reading, showing a 14 percent drop in revenue from the previous year and the doubling of their net debt to 488 million euros. The club enacted a temporary pay cut of 70 percent at the end of March in the height of the pandemic, lasting the duration of Spain's national state of alarm, which ended in June. Barca's financial troubles also led them to spend the close season lightening the biggest wage bill in European football, offloading Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal for next to nothing, while selling Arthur Melo for 72 million euros and Nelson Semedo for 30 million. They only brought in three players, Miralem Pjanic, Francisco Trincao and Sergino Dest for a combined 112 million euros. They failed to make any extra additions before the

James scored 28 points as the Los Angeles Lakers moved to within one win of a 17th NBA championship on Tuesday with a 102-96 victory over the Miami Heat.Humbled by Miami in game three on Sunday, James and the Lakers came roaring back in a hard-fought defensive battle that was finely balanced until Los Angeles pulled away in the closing minutes.The win leaves the Lakers 3-1 up in the best-of-seven series, meaning they can clinch the championship with victory in game five in Orlando on Friday."It felt like both teams were desperate, understanding the situation they had put themselves in," James said afterwards."Trying to get every extra possession, execute offensively, not to make mistakes defensively, that's what it was all about."James started slowly but clicked in the second half to lead the scoring while providing eight assists and hauling down 12 rebounds.Anthony Davis meanwhile finished with 22 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with a vital 15 point contribution.Caldwell-Pope's tally included a three-pointer and a layup in the closing stages that put the Lakers seven points ahead with two minutes remaining.Davis then drained only his second three-pointer of the night with 39.5 seconds left on the clock to give the Lakers a 100-91 lead and effectively seal the contest.Butler, the 40-point hero of Miami's win on Sunday, was restricted to 22 points, frustrated throughout by a commanding defensive display from Davis."He challenges me every night, I challenge him every night," James said of Davis. "We have to do things to help our team win, defensively, and offensively, and he did that tonight â he was spectacular."Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the game had been decided in key moments in the closing stages."There was some moments of truth there at the end, and probably the bottom line is they won those moments of truth," Spoelstra said."It came down to making plays. They just made more plays and more shots to seal it."An attritional contest saw defenses on top throughout, with Miami containing the threat of James and Davis for long periods.James in particular struggled to generate his usual rhythm throughout the first half, giving up five turnovers and scoring just eight points.The Lakers looked to have built a head of steam towards the end of the first quarter, edging into a 27-22 lead after a Kyle Kuzma three-pointer and a driving layup from Alex Caruso.But Miami responded swiftly at the start of the second quarter, transforming a five-point deficit into a 33-29 lead after Jae Crowder's three-pointer.Butler, meanwhile had started smoothly, going five-from-five in the first quarter to move into double figures.Despite Miami's defensive efforts, the Lakers were still able to carve open a series of good looks, only for off-target shooting to let them down.Nevertheless the Lakers had inched into a two-point lead at half-time at 49-47.In the third quarter, James' shooting from distance improved, his first three-pointer of the night coming with a 29-foot effort to put the Lakers ahead at 55-54.A Danny Green bucket was followed by a driving layup from James and the Lakers had suddenly moved into a 59-54 lead.James made another long-range three shortly afterward to put the Lakers 62-57 up with 6:44 left in the third.Davis's first three-pointer of the game from 28 feet put the Lakers seven points clear with two minutes left in the third.The Los Angeles big man closed the quarter with four free throws to leave the Lakers five points clear heading into the fourth.The Lakers maintained that advantage for much of the fourth quarter.Tyler Herro's three-point jump shot cut the Lakers lead to one point at 76-75, but three free throws from Markieff Morris followed by a superb fadeaway from James stretched the Los Angeles cushion to six points midway through the fourth.Butler raised Miami's hopes after tying it at 83-83, but the Lakers pulled away with Caldwell-Pope's three-pointer transition followed by a layup to make it 95-88 with two minutes left on the clock.Rajon Rondo's layup was then followed by a Davis crucial three-pointer with 39.5 seconds left which sealed the win. LeBron James scored 28 points as the Los Angeles Lakers moved to within one win of a 17th NBA championship on Tuesday with a 102-96 victory over the Miami Heat.Humbled by Miami in game three on Sunday, James and the Lakers came roaring back in a hard-fought defensive battle that was finely balanced until Los Angeles pulled away in the closing minutes.The win leaves the Lakers 3-1 up in the best-of-seven series, meaning they can clinch the championship with victory in game five in Orlando on Friday."It felt like both teams were desperate, understanding the situation they had put themselves in," James said afterwards."Trying to get every extra possession, execute offensively, not to make mistakes defensively, that's what it was all about."James started slowly but clicked in the second half to lead the scoring while providing eight assists and hauling down 12 rebounds.Anthony Davis meanwhile finished with 22 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with a vital 15 point contribution.Caldwell-Pope's tally included a three-pointer and a layup in the closing stages that put the Lakers seven points ahead with two minutes remaining.Davis then drained only his second three-pointer of the night with 39.5 seconds left on the clock to give the Lakers a 100-91 lead and effectively seal the contest.Butler, the 40-point hero of Miami's win on Sunday, was restricted to 22 points, frustrated throughout by a commanding defensive display from Davis."He challenges me every night, I challenge him every night," James said of Davis. "We have to do things to help our team win, defensively, and offensively, and he did that tonight â he was spectacular."Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the game had been decided in key moments in the closing stages."There was some moments of truth there at the end, and probably the bottom line is they won those moments of truth," Spoelstra said."It came down to making plays.

Then the Ukrainian Association of Football (FFU) announced on Tuesday that Real Madrid's youngster Andriy Lunin and FC Oleksandriya's veteran Yuriy Pankiv also contracted the virus.Dynamo Kiev's 26-year-old Georguiy Buschan will be the only fit goalie for Ukraine coach Andriy Shevchenko, whose task of preparing for the upcoming UEFA Nations League was further complicated by the withdrawal of five other Shakhtar Donetsk players due to coronavirus concerns."The situation is difficult. Let's see what the organizers say," FFU spokesman Oleksandr Glyvynsky told reporters when asked whether their match against France should be canceled. Meanwhile, the Portuguese football federation confirmed that their defender Jose Fonte will miss Wednesday's friendly with Spain after testing positive for COVID-19.The 36-year-old Lille star, who moved to Chinese Super League side Dalian Yifang in a shocking move in 2018, will be replaced by Granada's Domingos Dauarte, according to their coach Fernando Santos.In Switzerland, the Swiss football federation (SFV) announced that Xherdan Shaqiri, who traveled to St. Gallen ahead of their team's friendly with Croatia on Wednesday, has contracted the coronavirus.He became the third Liverpool player to test positive for the virus in a week, following Spanish midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Senegalese striker Sadio Mane. It remains unclear if Switzerland players who have been in contact with Shaqiri will be quarantined, with SFV only revealing that they will comply with COVID-19 rules imposed by health authorities.Both world champions France and European champions Portugal reported new COVID-19 cases ahead of their international fixtures, while Ukraine were dealt a huge blow after eight players withdrew from the squad due to a surge in coronavirus infections.Lyon right-back Leo Dubois was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 after testing positive following Tuesday evening's training session, according to the French football federation.The 26-year-old was immediately sent home and placed in quarantine with Real Madrid's Ferland Mendy being temporarily drafted in to fill the gap.The side of Didier Deschamps are set to play against Ukraine on Wednesday but the warm-up match has been thrown into chaos after three Ukrainian goalkeepers tested positive for coronavirus.Shakhtar Donetsk's Andriy Pyatov was the first to come down with COVID-19 earlier in the week.

On my level, it's impossible to keep that level of consistency," said Swiatek, who broke the 159th-ranked Trevisan six times."I just stayed, like, really down-to-earth and really positive. I did that pretty well," she said.World number 131 Podoroska, who had never won a Grand Slam main draw match before the tournament, became the first qualifier in the Open era to reach the women's last four at Roland Garros.Swiatek, ranked 54th, is also through to her first major semi-final and cited the success of Osaka, who captured her third Grand Slam title last month, as a factor in her breakout performance."It was inspiring," Swiatek said of Osaka's return to form in New York after an indifferent 18 months for the Japanese star."I also know I can do better sometimes. I just kept working. Naomi is a good example of a player that just did the right work, and result was the effect of that."Podoroska stunned third seed Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-4 and joined exclusive company as only the third female qualifier to make the last four of a Grand Slam.Podoroska will now attempt to become the first qualifier in history to advance to the final of any of the four majors.Alexandra Stevenson reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1999 while Christine Dorey achieved a similar run at the 1978 Australian Open. "My dream is to be number one. That will never change," said Podoroska, whose only other Grand Slam appearance came at the 2016 US Open.""I don't want to wake up," added Podoroska, the first Argentine woman to reach a major semi-final since Paola Suarez in Paris in 2004. Gabriela Sabatini, the 1990 U.S. Open winner, is the country's only women's Grand Slam singles champion.Meanwhile, Argentine and 12th seed Diego Schwartzman defeated U.S. Open champion and third seed Dominic Thiem in a five-hour epic to reach the Roland Garros semi-finals, his first ever Grand Slam last-four appearance.The 28-year-old Schwartzman triumphed 7-6 (7/1), 5-7, 6-7 (6/8), 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 and will face either 12-time champion Rafael Nadal or Italian teenager Jannik Sinner for a place in the final.It was one marathon too many for Thiem, the runner-up in Paris for the last two years, who had needed five sets and three and a half hours to down world number 239 Hugo Gaston in the fourth round.Schwartzman's success came on the same day that compatriot Nadia Podoroska, the world 131st, reached the last-four of the women's singles."Dominic is one of the great players. He is my best friend and I have a lot of respect for him," said Schwartzman. "So this win is very important for me. In the second and third sets, I was going a little crazy and I was screaming at myself because I had so many chances."But, come on, I deserved to win tonight," added Schwartzman who defeated Nadal in the Rome quarter-finals on the eve of the French Open.Thiem had been attempting to reach a fifth successive semi-final in Paris.However, despite crunching 65 winners to his opponent's 47, he committed 81 unforced errors in a match which featured 19 breaks of serve and at five hours and eight minutes was the second longest of the tournament.Iga Swiatek said she drew inspiration from U.S Open winner Naomi Osaka after sweeping into the semi-finals of the French Open on Tuesday by ending the run of her opponent, Italian qualifier Martina Trevisan.The Polish teenager followed up her emphatic win over top seed Simona Halep by defeating Trevisan 6-3, 6-1 to set up a meeting with Argentina's Nadia Podoroska."I just knew that I'm not going to play as perfect as with Simona.

"Roger this morning just confirmed publicly he'll be here," said Tiley in a video conference on Sunday. If Federer shows up at the Melbourne Park by then, it will mark his Grand Slam comeback after a prolonged injury break. In February, the 20-time Grand Slam champion had an arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, which led to him skipping the Dubai, Indian Wells, Bogota, Miami and the French Open. In June, he made a follow-up decision, announcing he would be missing the rest of the season due to a setback during rehabilitation and an additional arthroscopic procedure that followed. "I plan to take the necessary time to be 100 percent ready to play at my highest level," said Federer in a statement on Twitter back then. As revealed by his coach Severin Luthi in a September's interview, Federer has been committed to making a return at Grand Slam tournaments next year and there are plans to begin to take to the court in early October. The last tour-level tournament Federer played was the Australian Open in January this year, where he lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the semifinals. The 2020 Australian Open was the only Grand Slam tournament of the season that was not affected by the coronavirus pandemic; however, going forward, the event has to gear up with all necessary safety measures against the COVID-19."Bubbles" in cities across Australia will be established to accommodate players arriving early, providing them with a safe environment leading up to the Grand Slam."(Players) will have two weeks of quarantine that they will do in cities around Australia, and for those two weeks, we're creating a bubble from the hotel to the courts in a training environment," said the tournament's director Craig Tiley. "By then, we expect the border to be completely open, and we can move from city to city and then come down to Melbourne for the Australian Open for the last two weeks of January."According to Tiley, the tournament will allow up to 50 percent of the public for games. This is significant progress in comparison with this year's U.S. Open, which was played without fans, and the ongoing French Open allows only a handful of spectators.It will also pose a big challenge for tournament organizers as the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, accounts for 90 percent of Australia's 894 COVID-19-related deaths, and is witnessing a recent rise in the number of cases. (Cover image: Roger Federer of Switzerland plays a backhand in his semi-final match against Novak Djokovic of Serbia on day eleven of the 2020 Australian Open at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, January 30, 2020. /VCG)After an injury setback that kept him out for most of the 2020 season, Roger Federer will finally return to competitive tennis at the 2021 Australian Open, slated to start on January 18, 2021. According to the tournament's director and CEO of Tennis Australia Craig Tiley, the Swiss tennis great confirmed he is participating.

"I've worked really hard during the time off and I feel eager to compete and represent this incredible club." The arrival of left-back Telles from Porto for 13.5 million pounds ($23.85 million) is arguably even more important to aid a United defense that has conceded 11 goals in three Premier League games to start the season. "He is a player we have been tracking for some time and his performances over the past few years are exactly what we are looking for," said Solskjaer on the Brazilian international. Thomas Partey has been a long-term target for the Gunners, who have reportedly matched his 50-million-euro buyout clause to bolster their threadbare midfield options. The Ghanian has made 188 appearances for the Spanish giants and was part of the Atletico sides that reached the 2016 Champions League final and beat Arsenal on the way to winning the Europa League in 2018. Uruguayan international Lucas Torreira is expected to go the other way from Arsenal to Atletico on a season-long loan deal. Arsenal have made an impressive start to the season, winning three of their opening four Premier League games, as they aim to return to the Champions League next season for the first time in five years. However, the Londoners have been short in central midfield with Mesut Ozil and Matteo Guendouzi, who has joined Hertha Berlin on a season-long loan, frozen out by Mikel Arteta. Premier League table-toppers Everton signed center-back Ben Godfrey for a reported initial fee of 25 million pounds. Europe's giants busy on transfer final day. Juventus secured one of the hottest properties in Italian football as Federico Chiesa joined from Fiorentina on a two-year loan deal worth 10 million euros with an obligation to buy if certain conditions are met for a further 40 million. English defender Chris Smalling returned to Roma on a permanent deal from Manchester United for 15 million euros after impressing during a loan spell last season. French midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko has also returned to Serie A, joining Napoli on loan from Chelsea. Bayern Munich added a trio of new players as Douglas Costa returned to the Allianz Arena for a second spell on loan from Juventus. The European champions also signed former PSG striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting on a one-year deal and Bouna Sarr from Marseille. However, Barcelona's financial problems meant they could not agree deals for Lyon's Memphis Depay or Manchester City defender Eric Garcia, as the Catalan club revealed 97 million euro losses for the past season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Manchester United swooped for Edinson Cavani, Alex Telles and Amad Diallo on Monday, but Arsenal are expected to complete the biggest deal of transfer deadline day with the arrival of Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey. United were under the spotlight to respond to a humiliating 6-1 home defeat to Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday. Dutch international midfielder Donny van de Beek had been the only addition to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad of the window prior to Monday. Cavani, 33, has been a free agent since leaving Paris Saint-Germain in June and signed a one-year deal with the option for a second season. The Uruguayan scored 200 goals in seven seasons in the French capital to become the club's all-time top goalscorer. "Manchester United is one of the greatest clubs in the world, so it is a real honor to be here," said Cavani.

a rare scene as most sports leagues in the country still limit the audience to a moderate amount. First played in 2007, the charity basketball game was led by the country's iconic basketball legend Yao Ming's YAO Foundation and was aimed at promoting the development of physical education in China's rural regions as well as reuniting society through sport. This year, it set out with a more important mission as it was deliberately staged in Wuhan to pass on the "spirit of sports" and inject energy and passion into the city and local people. Medical staff who worked on the frontline fighting the coronavirus were part of the lineup and a special ceremony was held before the game to pay tribute to the heroes who fought COVID-19. Celebrities such as China's first Winter Olympics gold medalist Yang Yang, renowned news commentator Bai Yansong, actor and philanthropist Pu Cunxin attended the event to leverage their influence and show their support to the cause. The Yao Foundation Charity Game originated from a post-game talk Yao Ming had with former NBA guard Steve Nash, with Nash proposing charity games as a way to raise funds for China's various youth charities. Ten of these games have been held since the first in 2007. "You feel the sense of achievement when each year's Charity Game successfully concludes," said Yao Ming. "As it goes however, I realized that it transformed into some responsibilities and something you can't live without."In 2012, the Yao Foundation Hope Primary School Basketball Season, a project aimed at providing more teenagers in underprivileged regions with the opportunities and resources to play basketball was launched. As of 2019, the foundation had sent out 2,240 volunteers, and almost 1.15 million schoolchildren in rural areas have benefited from the program.The focus on prioritizing children's physical education and development through sports also got passed on to the charity game as, starting in 2013, a special third quarter was designated to feature children players from primary schools. Zhang Jiacheng, the remarkable one-armed teenage basketballer, joined other primary school kids in the Sunday's game and took the event to a climax with his impressive basketball skills. In the end, the Chinese Star Team led by the Chinese national basketball head coach Du Feng overcame the special team comprised of medical staff together with foreign players and entertainment stars 122-107. (Cover image: China's basketball national team player Kyranbek Makan celebrates after scoring during the Yao Foundation charity game in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, October 4, 2020. /VCGBasketball and other sports stars, medical workers, celebrities as well as local children contributed to a memorable charity basketball game on Sunday night in Wuhan to together boost the city's confidence in the post-pandemic era. More than 7,500 cheered the players on at the stadium -

And football, as I said, is a bridge between China and the rest of the world. Everyone plays football."Expanding on that theme, Liu said: "China is still open. And the development of Chinese football needs help from external stakeholders like the AFC (Asian Football Confederation), FIFA and also other federations as well, and other leagues as well.""We are definitely going to carry on with that kind of partnership, working with all the international governing bodies, brands and stakeholders," he added.China are 76th in the FIFA rankings and their chances of reaching the Qatar 2022 World Cup are in the balance, underlining how far they have to go to reach the top.But speaking in Suzhou, where the Chinese Super League is in a "bubble" to thwart the coronavirus, Liu said that failing to qualify will not deter the country from its long-term goals."To win a spot (in Qatar) means a lot to the Chinese, to the country and also the Chinese football community because that boosts the confidence and gives motivation to every stakeholder and to the football community to contribute more to the development of Chinese football," he said."If we fail, you might have a short-term setback, but the president of the central government understands football and that developing football is a process."Along with building a football infrastructure and overhauling grassroots, school and youth systems, the CSL is a crucial part of the determination to be a superpower in the sport.The league made headlines in recent years when a series of well-known foreign players â along with coaches â arrived on generous contracts and for inflated transfer fees.However, the CFA has since introduced measures such as a salary cap so that the largesse is redirected towards developing young Chinese players."We want to be one of the top leagues in Asia, for sure, which we probably already are, but the benchmark is not supposed to be big spending," said Liu. "It's about sustainability."Liu conceded that Oscar and other overseas stars, such as fellow Brazilians Hulk and Paulinho, have boosted the CSL's profile."But has that (expensive foreigners) helped the development of the local players? That's our question mark," he said.Bayern Munich winger Kingsley Coman picked up where he left off last season with two goals in a 4-0 home rout of Atletico Madrid on Wednesday as the holders got the defense of their Champions League campaign off to a winning start.Coman, whose header settled last season's Champions League final against Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) just 59 days ago in Lisbon, scored Bayern's opening goal, created their second and claimed their fourth behind closed doors at the Allianz Arena."We played very well, I am very happy with my two goals," Coman told Sky Sports."The winning goal in last season's final is a good motivator, but it's in the past now and we have fresh goals this season." Coman saved his best for last with a superb effort, turning the Atletico defense inside out before firing home on 72 minutes.Goals by midfielders Leon Goretzka and Corentin Tolisso, who produced an unstoppable long-range strike from outside the box, added to Atletico's misery in Munich.The defeat was the joint heaviest Atletico has suffered under Diego Simeone, rivaling the 4-0 drubbing dished out at Dortmund almost exactly two years ago.Real Madrid made an embarrassing start in the Champions League on Wednesday as Shakhtar Donetsk pulled off a shock 3-2 win away to 13-time winners Real Madrid in their Champions League Group B opener on Wednesday, despite the Ukrainian side missing 10 players due to injuries and COVID-19.Strikes from Tete and Manor Solomon, either side of a Raphael Varane own-goal, gave the Ukrainian champions a shock lead at the interval and while Luka Modric and Vinicius Junior pulled goals back, Madrid fell short.Fede Valverde thought he had grabbed an equalizer in injury time but his deflected shot was ruled out after VAR showed Vinicius was offside.La Liga champions Madrid, meanwhile, reflected on a second consecutive home defeat after losing 1-0 at their Alfredo di Stefano stadium to promoted Cadiz on Saturday, further denting their confidence ahead of the 'Classico' at Barcelona in three days' time."In the first half we were not worthy of this competition," said Madrid midfielder Modric."It's obvious we need to improve, we lacked confidence today, especially in the first half, but we have to move on, we can't waste any time regretting what has happened."Coach Zidane had insisted ahead of the game that he was not looking to the trip to Barca's Camp Nou but rested several big names against Shakhtar, choosing not to risk captain Sergio Ramos and starting without Toni Kroos and attacking talisman Karim Benzema."I think Madrid underestimated us but we showed our football and our style," said Shakhtar's Korniienko.Romelu Lukaku scored twice, including a last-gasp equalizer, to rescue a 2-2 draw for Inter Milan in their Champions League opener against Borussia Moenchengladbach on Wednesday.Lukaku put Inter ahead after 49 minutes in the San Siro only for the Bundesliga club to hit back with a 63rd-minute Ramy Bensebaini penalty and a Jonas Hofmann strike six minutes from time.But Lukaku had the last word sending the ball in from close range in the final minute.Manchester City came from behind to make a winning start in Champions League Group C on Wednesday with a 3-1 victory over Porto at the Etihad Stadium."If I'm being honest, we are struggling at the moment," said City's German midfielder Gundogan."Fernandinho went off at the end, we have players playing in different positions. I am not 100 percent there because I had Covid, we are not all at the same moment."That is the challenge for this season, it's not going to end for a while," he added.Liverpool proved they can cope without Virgil van Dijk as Nicolas Tagliafico's own goal sealed a 1-0 win at Ajax in the opening game of their Champions League campaign on Wednesday (October 21).Critics have claimed Liverpool will struggle without Van Dijk, but Brazilian midfielder Fabinho filled in impressively alongside Joe Gomez at the heart of the defense."It was a good enough performance to win the game, which at moments was pretty wild. It was not one of our sunny shiny world class football days. It was not perfect but the boys fought like crazy," said a more satisfied Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp afterwards.(With input from agencies)Australia's Adam Scott, the winner of 14 PGA Tour titles, withdrew from the U.S. PGA Zozo Championship on Wednesday after testing positive for COVID-19. The 40-year-old from Adelaide was going to make his first start since sharing 38th at last month's U.S. Open. Instead, he will begin a self-isolation period under health and safety protocols. Scott will be hoping to get well in time to compete at the Masters, which was moved to November 12-15 in this year's coronavirus-disrupted schedule. Scott, ranked 15th, took his most recent U.S. PGA triumph in February at Riviera. American Jim Herman, the first alternate, replaced Scott in the Zozo field, which tees off Thursday in the opening round at Sherwood Country Club. Also missing from the Zozo field is world No. 1 Dustin Johnson, who tested positive for COVID-19 before last week's CJ Cup at Shadow Creek in Las Vegas. Johnson, still feeling low on energy, plans to play next at the Houston Open the week before the Masters. Since the PGA Tour restarted in mid-June following a COVID-forced shutdown, officials have made several attempts to bring back fans but each time they aborted efforts over health and safety concerns. The next two events on the PGA Tour schedule, the Bermuda Championship and Houston Open, plan to allow a limited number of fans. (With input from agencies)Manchester United posted a 23-million-pound ($30 million) loss for the financial year to June 30 as revenues fell due to the coronavirus pandemic and a lack of Champions League football. The fresh spike in COVID-19 cases across Europe is likely to further delay the return of supporters, hurting income from matchday ticket and catering sales, as well as museum tours for the bigger clubs. "Our top priority is to get fans back into the stadium safely and as soon as possible," said United Executive Vice Chairman Ed Woodward. Premier League clubs last week rejected plans put forward by Liverpool and Manchester United for radical changes to the English game's structure and finances and said they would conduct their own review. The Red Devils' wage bill fell by nearly 50 million pounds because player wages fell after the club failed to qualify for the Champions League and because high earners such as Alexis Sanchez and Romelu Lukaku were offloaded.United, who have made a mixed start to the new English Premier League season on the pitch, said revenue in the year ended June 30 fell by 19 percent to 509 million pounds, with some fixtures being delayed beyond that date. It gave no financial forecast for the current year.Meanwhile, net debt rose by 10 percent to 474.1 million pounds at the end of June compared with the end of March.The 20-time English champions said the impact of the coronavirus crisis on revenue has been partially offset by lower matchday costs and reduced travel due to the three-month suspension of matches from March to June. (With input from agencies)The virtual World Press Briefing (WPB) for the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games kicked off on Monday.The four-day conference, held online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, has attracted over 400 representatives to tune in including those from the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the International Paralympic Committee (IPC), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), National Paralympic Committees (NPCs), International Federations (IFs), and worldwide media, among other organizations.Organized by the Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee (BOCOG), the online press briefing is an opportunity for stakeholders to familiarize themselves with the ongoing preparations leading up to the Games. Taking into considerations the inability to carry out on-site tours, the conference will take advantage of simulation technology to present the construction and progress, spatial layout, and vehicles and personnel flow designs of the venues. Fifteen functional areas including media operations, venue constructions, registrations, accommodations, transport as well as securities will be touched upon. "Quality services for media organizations are an integral part of our work. We give high priority to media operations and will honor our bid commitments. We have done and will continue to do everything necessary to meet the pre-Games and Games-time needs of the media for Games coverage," Zhang Jiandong, executive vice president of the BOCOG said in his address.Zhang went on to express confidence in Beijing's smooth preparations for the Games despite the challenges brought by the coronavirus and vowed to provide "comprehensive, efficient and convenient" media services.This world press briefing is the first under the watch of Lucia de Montanarella, who was named IOC Media Operations chief in January."I think that the commitment of Beijing 2022 trying to deliver high standard services and facilities to the media is testified by the table that we see, with the top management of BOCOG participating at the opening of this world press briefing," Montanarella said during her opening remarks."It means a lot to the worldwide media to know that BOCOG gives the interests of the media such a high priority in their organization."(Cover image: Beijing 2022 World Press Briefing is held online in Beijing to brief the stakeholders worldwide about the ongoing preparations for the Beijing Winter Olympics, Beijing, October 19, 2020. /Beijing 2022 Organizing Committee)(With input from Xinhua news agency)On Chinese social media platforms, video uploaders usually would like to give the title "Foreigners are less series" to some parkour footages. That reflects few of the netizens know there is also a group of people in China playing parkour, and this sport could be aesthetic but not only thrilling.Mucun, born in the 90s in Chongqing, southwest China, is a full-time extreme sports filmmaker, mainly shooting parkour films. Through his works, people could see many aspects of Chinese parkour.During the college stage, Mucun's major had no relation to sports, but he's interested in street dance and other pop cultures. Once for adding a weapon to his breaking dance arsenal, he went to kungfu society to learn somersault, but then, he was attracted by the alumnus who were also playing parkour there.Having an introverted nature, Mucun just did parkour exercise silently and gradually got in touch with China's core parkour athletes in the following years. At the same time, he started to record the playing and tried to make it better.Putting a sports camera on an athlete's body is a general method of taking parkour shots, but that will easily make the audience dizzy. Thus, an eligible parkour cameraman should know about both â how to play parkour and how to get clear images.Sometimes, shooting parkour film could be, to a certain degree, much tiring than just playing it, as the videographer has to run nearly the same route for many times while controlling the camera, paying attention to terrain, machine, and passengers at the same time.But for Mucun personally, the hardest thing is to communicate with athletes, as most of them have formal jobs, parkour is only their hobby, and it's difficult to organize a project with everyone's schedule suitable. Furthermore, when the shooting comes into a challenge, he has to decide whether to persuade the athlete to continue or not."I'm not a person who's good at communicating, and for these years, I have experienced a lot of up and downs on it, fortunately now, I have some faithful friends to cooperate with," Mucun said.As there's rare full-time parkour filmmakers in China, Mucun plays the roles of producer, director, cinematographer, video editor, and special effects maker in most of his projects, and the loneliness makes his career develop slow.While working alone, it still has benefit as he learns many operations of diverse camera equipment during the process. Now, the main types of his work are pure parkour skill show, documentary, and parkour action movie. Besides, he also did some vlogs and films of other extreme sports.To improve his shooting quality, Mucun now attends professional roller skating class regularly. Even though he has quite flexible work, he often gets up at 5:00 a.m. to edit video and arranges his schedule with full activities to 10:00 p.m.Since his first parkour film Super Tramp winning the Banff China Outdoor Film Fest's Best Cinematography Award, Mucun walks on the road of parkour filmmaking more and more confidently. When talking about his goal, he said, "I'd like to make Chinese parkour film to a higher level, and let parkour own everyone's respect."(Video Editor: Li Chenqi)On Chinese social media platforms, video uploaders usually would like to give the title "Foreigners are less series" to some parkour footages.

Once for adding a weapon to his breaking dance arsenal, he went to kungfu society to learn somersault, but then, he was attracted by the alumnus who were also playing parkour there.Having an introverted nature, Mucun just did parkour exercise silently and gradually got in touch with China's core parkour athletes in the following years. At the same time, he started to record the playing and tried to make it better.Putting a sports camera on an athlete's body is a general method of taking parkour shots, but that will easily make the audience dizzy. Thus, an eligible parkour cameraman should know about both â how to play parkour and how to get clear images.Sometimes, shooting parkour film could be, to a certain degree, much tiring than just playing it, as the videographer has to run nearly the same route for many times while controlling the camera, paying attention to terrain, machine, and passengers at the same time.But for Mucun personally, the hardest thing is to communicate with athletes, as most of them have formal jobs, parkour is only their hobby, and it's difficult to organize a project with everyone's schedule suitable. Furthermore, when the shooting comes into a challenge, he has to decide whether to persuade the athlete to continue or not."I'm not a person who's good at communicating, and for these years, I have experienced a lot of up and downs on it, fortunately now, I have some faithful friends to cooperate with," Mucun said.As there's rare full-time parkour filmmakers in China, Mucun plays the roles of producer, director, cinematographer, video editor, and special effects maker in most of his projects, and the loneliness makes his career develop slow.While working alone, it still has benefit as he learns many operations of diverse camera equipment during the process. Now, the main types of his work are pure parkour skill show, documentary, and parkour action movie. Besides, he also did some vlogs and films of other extreme sports.To improve his shooting quality, Mucun now attends professional roller skating class regularly. Even though he has quite flexible work, he often gets up at 5:00 a.m. to edit video and arranges his schedule with full activities to 10:00 p.m.Since his first parkour film Super Tramp winning the Banff China Outdoor Film Fest's Best Cinematography Award, Mucun walks on the road of parkour filmmaking more and more confidently. When talking about his goal, he said, "I'd like to make Chinese parkour film to a higher level, and let parkour own everyone's respect."(Video Editor: Li Chenqi)Every jump matters; every competition counts.

The article reflects the author's opinions and not necessarily the views of CGTN.Given that some major U.S. media and politicians made groundless claims that the novel coronavirus originates in China, blamed and slandered China, even asked for an apology from China, then I have every reason to ask 10 questions for the United States about its origin too. Better still, unlike the U.S., I did a lot homework and will base my questions on international media coverage of COVID-19.Question 1Since the director of the U.S. Centers of Disease Control, Robert Redfield admitted that some Americans seemingly dying from flu were tested positive for the novel coronavirus, can I conclude that those people actually died from the novel coronavirus? Among the 34 million influenza patients, with a death toll of 20,000, how many were misdiagnosed?When did the misdiagnoses start? And did it actually start from August 2019? These questions are so vital that the world is waiting for an explanation from the United States.Question 2When there were some misdiagnoses admitted by U.S. CDC, I'm scratching my head â isn't the U.S. that owns the best medical technologies in the world? Why did that happen?As the ground glass opacity (white patches) can be easily seen in CT scans of the lungs of patients with the novel coronavirus-infected pneumonia, it should have been an easy thing to separate the cases of COVID-19 and H1N1 flu. But why were there so many misdiagnoses?Well, that reminds me of the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence's request of controlling all messaging regard to the coronavirus. Why does the White House call for messaging control? Does the U.S. need to hide something? Are they plotting some conspiracy?Question 3Why did the U.S. withdraw from the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) in 2001? Why did it try to prevent a monitoring mechanism for the execution of the Convention? Is it standing in the way of developing biological weapon for the U.S.?If not, why are there new biological laboratories in Georgia, Ukraine, Moldova, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan? Are those labs for biochemical warfare? It's impossible that they are keeping viruses as pets. If the U.S. is aiming at provoking a biochemical war, who would be the first target then? Also, how about the swine flu outbreak in China last year? The odd thing is that it broke out in different places simultaneously instead of breaking out separately. Why were drones used to poison the pigs? Was the U.S. behind all that? I heard that it was the pork speculators. But that theory makes no sense â since the swine flu killed millions of pigs in China during the same period of time, pork speculators would suffer great loss instead of profits.The best possible answer to that was foreign meddling. I was among those who wondered if the U.S. had anything to do with that and hoped for an explanation.Question 4The U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, located on Fort Detrick, Maryland, was shut down in July 2019. Was it because there was a virus leakage incident?Just one month later, there was an influenza outbreak across the country. Were those two things related in any way?Were the misdiagnoses simply cooked up to cover up such secrets? Did that also become a motive for the U.S. to shift the blame to other countries by labeling them as the origin of the novel coronavirus?Was that an epic coincidence or a dirty secret in disguise? Why did the U.S. erase huge number of English news reports on the internet covering the shutdown in March 2020? Is there anything to hide, or is there anything to worry about?Question 5At the 7th Military World Games (October 18-27, 2019) held in Wuhan, why did the U.S. team (369 members) win ZERO gold medal? Did that even look like a reasonable record for the world's leading military power? Did your government do it on purpose?Was anyone among the 369 participants ever (mis)diagnosed with influenza? Was it possible they were carriers of the novel coronavirus?The best thing for the U.S. now is to stop burying its head in the sand and give the 369 people PCT tests to see if they are infected.Question 6Why did the U.S. hold Event 201, a global pandemic exercise in October 2019? Why was the CIA deputy director participating it? Is it because the U.S. has foreseen a highly-infectious virus is about to cause a pandemic? One month later, cases of pneumonia of unknown cause were detected in China and there was a pandemic three months later. Probably, it's not just a coincidence.Question 7Japan, South Korea, Italy and Iran all reported that many of their first COVID-19 confirmed cases had no exposure history with China but showed connection with the United States. How come?Genetic research shows that the type of novel coronavirus found in China belongs to Group C, but Group A and Group B viruses â Group C's parental and grand parental viruses â are both found in the United States. Why? A Japanese patient was diagnosed with influenza in Hawaii but was tested positive for COVID-19 when he returned to Japan. How to explain that?Some COVID-19 cases in the U.S. had no connection with China whatsoever. So where does it come from?Question 8You've got no reason to deny that the 1918 Pandemic originated within your territory. But you let Spain bear the blame for as long as a century. Don't you feel shame on that?History seems to repeat itself. So, is the U.S. playing the trick again and attempting to label the novel coronavirus as the "Chinese Virus"?Question 9The 1918 Pandemic, causing 1 billion infections, with a death toll "estimated to have been anywhere from 17 million to 50 million, and possibly as high as 100 million... one of the deadliest epidemics in human history," according to wikipedia, was proven originating in the U.S., but the U.S. has never apologized to the world. So far, the origin of the novel coronavirus is still unknown, but the United States is requiring China for an apology, how ridiculous is that! Just to remind the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic killing 300,000 people also originated in the U.S., and also the same for HIV AIDS. So why not confess to the world?Question 10In movies, the U.S. is fond of playing the role of the world savior. The image of Captain America is one of its most popular symbols. However, in reality, in the face of a disaster like COVID-19, where is Captain America?The U.S. is not doing enough to protect its citizens at home or on the Diamond Princess cruise ship. It even attempted to make Japan responsible for Americans on Diamond Princess. How does the U.S. have the brass to do all these and accuse China of being irresponsible?While China bought the world valuable time to battle COVID-19, the U.S. accused China of being passive and lacking transparency. Well, when the White House instructed the CDC to stop tallying the people tested for novel coronavirus, did that count as transparency? When the U.S. government advised its people not to wear masks, was it not being passive? Just too many questions call for the U.S.'s explanations.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com.)The 7th Military World Games took place in China's Wuhan from October 18 to 27. In this video, people around the world expressed their feelings about this sports feast.It was yet another bittersweet moment for me as I completed my role in covering the 7th Military World Games.I knew nothing about the games and admittedly had not heard of it prior to attending, but now I takeaway with me something more."Friendship through sports" is the motto of the games, and this really shined through in Wuhan, China. I saw it with my own eyes and felt it with my heart how new friends and connections are forged not just between the army of different countries but also within a country.The military games is, after all, a multi-sport event â 27 sports, in fact. A military Olympics indeed it was. It's the scale of this event and the sense of a "big family" that differentiates it from other individual sports games, many athletes told me.A few things stood out to me in my reporting.First, many of the international athletes I've spoken to have competed worldwide, but it's their very first time in China. So, it was nice to hear what they think and have to say about the country.Second, many of the athletes have their own lives and jobs outside of the military.Cecilia Sjoeholm from Sweden is one of them. She works as a part-time chef in the Swedish Armed Forces."It has given me friendship, and that's the most important thing. I would not have done it for 10 years if it wasn't for my Swedish friends, people I love, and my friends in the naval pentathlon team from around the world. They're friends forever, and that's why it makes this sport so special," she told me.I've seen how the females compete in the naval pentathlon, and boy, it isn't easy. It features five events: an obstacle course, life-saving swimming, utility swimming, seamanship, and an amphibious cross-country race."The core skill in naval pentathlon is the physical strength, the mental stability which is very needed out in the sea when it could be very cold, rainy, you're wet and tired,"  Swedish team captain Joakim Hiertner said.Another naval pentathlon athlete from Poland, Edyta Korczak told me,  "It makes me feel like I have another family. I can compete with them, but we can be best friends. This is the best thing about sports."Military capabilities and sports skills aside, it's also about the way different countries approach the sport.It may be 23-year old Bianca Caruso's first time in China, but she has competed worldwide and with the Chinese for a couple of years now."I think Chinese are really humble sailors. They are really quiet, always focused on what they are doing. I think what we can learn from them is for sure because we Italians are... kind of jokers," she told me.Likewise, Hu Rong from the sailing competition management committee said there is much that the Chinese can learn from international athletes."It's like their love for the sport comes from within, and they do things with feeling. When they align their boats, the 470s, they do it with attention to detail," Hu Rong said. "We Chinese can also learn how to just simply enjoy the process of competing from the international athletes that and their flexibility in changing roles on the boat."Truly, many life lessons can be gained from sports. For example, I learned from Hu Rong that with sailing the most important skill required is adaptability."This is the number one thing I teach my students because when you have the ability to adapt well, you can change your techniques to navigate different environments. In sailing, adaptability can make up for what you lack in physical strength," she said.Meanwhile, a sport you might not have linked to military sports is golf. Hence, the reason I pitched this story.Nicolas Calvet, a golfer from France, told me that golf has many worthwhile life lessons that can be applied to in one's life and job."Golf has given me a lot, personally and in the job because it teaches you to be really humble and to be honest with yourself," Calvet said. "If you make a mistake, it's nobody's fault but yours. And in the military role, if you can't just look at yourself and say that's me; I'm this, and I have this; you can't go anywhere."I am not sure, but I don't think many other sports allow you to spend over 4-5 hours competing with your small group of teammates.As Arjan De Haas from the Netherlands said, "You can talk about their family, about their homes, what they do at home. We're all in the army, but we're in different parts of the army. So, it's nice to talk about it."As the Games come to a close, I think it's important to take a step back and ponder why is there a need to gather military personnel on the field of sports?According to Major Jan-Henrik Baeck, a board member of the International Sports Military Council (CISM), the most important thing for soldiers to have a platform to meet is that they set up new networks."You set up new connections with other people that you have not reached before," Baeck said."For instance, when I go to a competition, I meet some people from China and Korea, and two years later, I'm in an international mission, and I reach my same buddies that I've reached before, and we are on speaking terms directly. So, this is one of the best things with this community."Now, how can I end this piece without mentioning the Athletes' Village! A place where I called my second home in the past two weeks.To be sure, I don't live there, but almost 10-thousand athletes, coaches and officials from over 100 countries did.It was pretty embarrassing that people I met who saw me at some of the games said to me at the village, "Hey Lynn how are your interviews going?" and proceeded to ask others around us if I have interviewed them yet. Well, I call it devotion to the job!My respect for sportsmen and women just went up a notch. Sports can truly shape a person's life for the better as many athletes have told me, and can bring about friendship and camaraderie on and beyond the field.I may not be a professional athlete who travels around the world, but I have my job where I can explore and bring these stories to all of you.And this alone is enough for me. I had a great time covering the 7th Military World Games and I have, along the way, gained many friends globally and learned from their stories.Also, I'm not sure if this already exists, but wouldn't it be nice to have a Journalist World Games perhaps? Gathering journalists of the world in the field of sports? Every profession needs an outlet to let loose and showcase one's talent and passion, after all.Chinese President Xi Jinping, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC), signed an order on Monday to reward the Chinese athletes and coaches that participated in the 7th Military World Games in Wuhan, central China.Xi pointed out that the Chinese athletes and coaches, as representatives of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Armed Police Force, had fought all out in the competition, sharing friendship and safeguarding peace while vying for sporting achievements and pursuing sportsmanship. Their performances have won honors for the country as well as for the PLA.Xi emphasized that the historic breakthrough by the Chinese delegation in the 7th Military World Games was achieved with the PLA Sports Delegation keeping the instructions of the CMC in their mind and with the goal of "first-class competition and first-class performances."The order called for the Chinese athletes and coaches to cherish the honor without being arrogant, and to look to achieve greater glories in the future. The order also called on the entire army to learn from the Military World Games' Chinese participants, as well as fighting for the goal of strengthening the PLA while striving to develop a world-class army.The 7th Military World Games, the biggest ever "Olympics for the military," closed on Sunday after 10 days of competition, as hosts China collected 133 golds and 239 medals in total, the first time a country has earned over a 100 gold medals.Held from October 18 to 27, the quadrennial event attracted a record number of participants, with nearly 10,000 officers and soldiers from 109 countries competing in 27 sports.Read more:7th Military World Games closes in ChinaAfter a historic 10 days of competition in Wuhan, central China, the 7th Military World Games wrapped up with an exciting closing ceremony with the theme of friendship. Watch my vlog for a closer look at the special night.It all began on one cloudy day in May 2015 when the central Chinese city of Wuhan dropped a bombshell announcing that it had won the bid to host the 2019 Military World Games â a grand gathering of thousands of soldiers from around the world and second only to the Olympics in terms of scale.There were fears that Wuhan might not be up to the task of staging China's most important international sporting event since 2008. In addition, there were serious concerns over whether there would be a clear social and economic rationale for the event that goes beyond simply hosting a limelight-hogging extravaganza.The unyielding support, cooperation and dedication from all levels of government had raised the hopes of the Wuhan organizers, but a race against time to develop and upgrade the city's infrastructure dented optimism as the volume of public disquiet about the never-ending construction projects grew louder.Fast forward four years and the tables have turned. The 2019 Military World Games concluded gloriously after bedazzling the world with sporting brilliance, unprecedented geographical reach, unwavering promotion of peace and friendship, and unrivaled spectacle of opening and closing ceremonies.Within a span of 10 days, the highlights flowed thick and fast. Under the motto "Share friendship, build up peace," a record 9,308 military personnel from 109 countries and regions graced the stage in Wuhan in a record 27 events. China achieved its best-ever gold medal haul of 133 on the back of thorough preparations, steely commitment and virtuoso performances. With 67 Olympic and world champions turning out for the jamboree, seven world records were smashed and 85 International Military Sports Commission (CISM) affiliated records were broken. CISM President Herve Piccirillo, who was a living embodiment of jollity and cheerfulness at the closing gala on Sunday, showered praise on Wuhan, saying the hosts "have excellently completed the mission" and the Military World Games will leave the city "unparalleled tangible and intangible heritage for the future generations." It evidently helped that so many locals were extremely zealous about the Games, which were truly omnipresent as special banners and flags found their way into every nook and cranny of Wuhan. It was the first time all competitions for the Games were staged in a single city, and to the pleasant surprise of the organizers, the tickets to a host of events became the hottest commodity in Wuhan. The organizers said more than 600,000 tickets were flying off the shelves. The atmosphere within the 5G-powered venues was second to none. From the intensity of the Naval Pentathlon at Mulan to the thrill of the Parachuting at Hannan and the zest of the Orienteering at Jiangxia, exhilarated crowds packed out almost every venue. For the memorable moments in the Wuhan Sports Center, at the Yishan Golf Club or on East Lake, the buzz stood comparison with any sporting event ever held in China.That's due in no small part to over 250,000 volunteers, who are frequently the unsung heroes when it comes to the crunch. The sense of warmth, intelligence, proficiency and humility they brought to long days of performing ordinary tasks in their eye-catching white-and-green uniforms was noteworthy and highly commendable. Their firm belief that they were part of something bigger rubbed off on the rest of the city.By any measure, Wuhan has delivered on its promise of fostering international cooperation and building peace through sport. As Piccirillo said, "Beyond the Games, it is all the Chinese people who are spreading this message of solidarity and peace."Moreover, the newly-built Athletes' Village, stretching over 565,000 square meters, earned rave reviews and successfully served as a bridge between a swathe of different cultures. Sports fields were noted for some endearing interactions among soldiers who merrily traded lapel pins that were made as mementos of each Games. Wuhan also deserves praise for meticulous attention to detail in planning and obsessive focus on efficiency. The smooth performance of its various transport systems provided more than enough insurance during the fortnight when the huge deluge of visitors descended on the metropolis.One thing Wuhan did exceptionally well was to carry out a roadmap that was underpinned by a responsible fiscal strategy. Instead of hosting the Games as an end in itself, the organizers put top priority on its long-term sustainability. From the very beginning, creating a post-Games legacy was at the heart of their planning.  The major infrastructure of the Games was designed and located with future housing and commercial development in mind. Even the Main Media Center, where all furniture and equipment were on loan from contractors, will be turned into a multipurpose gymnasium featuring an indoor ice rink, a fencing hall and an archery training center.Wuhan is fully capitalizing on the opportunity to leverage the Games to accelerate its extraordinary metamorphosis from an economic backwater into an international hub for business and tourism.There is no doubt that hosting the Games significantly bolstered Wuhan's profile and provided timely momentum for the city to start and finish projects that had been deliberated upon for years, including the world's longest double-deck suspension bridge, Yangsigang Yangtze River Bridge, Asia's largest underground urban complex in Optics Valley Square, and multiple new subway lines that spread out throughout the town.The impressive numbers back up that claim. According to Xinhua, over the past three years, Wuhan renovated 1,300 kilometers of its urban roads and saw its metro network reach 330 kilometers in total length. Meanwhile, a staggering 360,000 trees were planted.With its newfound international recognition, proven ability to stage massive sporting events and enormously positive impact on the Chinese psyche, Wuhan has even been touted as one of the potential candidates to host the 2032 Olympics. As described by Piccirillo, "The multiple venues built in line with highest standards in the world can serve any future international sports event that Wuhan may step up to host."For Wuhan observers and local residents, this rosy picture was far beyond their wildest dreams a decade ago. Basking in the success of the 7th Military World Games, Wuhan has immensely elevated its global status, and the social, economic and cultural impacts of the event will reach far beyond the lifespan of two weeks.Today, Wuhan is no longer in the shadows. The days are gone when the city's majestic Yellow Crane Tower and luscious hot dry noodles were almost unheard of outside China. The world is starting to take notice, and this is exactly the kind of publicity that money can't buy.Wuhan, the capital city of central China's Hubei Province, said goodbye to the 7th International Military Sports Council (CISM) Military World Games, the first international military multi-sport event held in China, with a closing ceremony on Sunday night.Col. Dorah Mamby Koita, Secretary General of the International Military Sports Council, presented the Fair Play Award to Col. Bertrand Gebuhrer, chief of the French delegation during the closing ceremonies of the World Military Games Sunday. The award is presented in recognition of sportsmanship, fair play and contributions to promoting the ideals and values of CISM.The 7th CISM Military World Games concluded in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, on Sunday.Team China, also the largest sports group at the Games, topped the medal table with a total of 133 gold medals, 64 silver medals and 42 bronze medals.CGTN takes you through a brief history of the Chinese delegation in military sports.1951 In September, the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) founded its first professional sports team, which included football, basketball, volleyball, track and field, swimming, lifting, gymnastics, and other sports as branches. The name, the August First Team or Bayi in Chinese, is because the PLA was founded on August 1, 1927.1978PLA observers attended the 32nd Congress of the International Military Sports Council (CISM), marking China starting its official military sports ties with the world.1981For the first time, the August First military pentathlon team participated in the 30th World Military Pentathlon Championship, and finished eighth among the 13 participating teams. 1982In December, the PLA founded its military sports team based in one of the competitive sports training centers for soldiers. The team focused on five events: shooting, military pentathlon, horse riding in modern pentathlon, fencing and triathlon (including cycling).2016-2018Institutional reforms that aimed at managing and optimizing sports resources implemented according to the PLA deepening reform plan.Under the newly launched Military Sports Training Center, a total of 29 discipline teams were set up. They included shooting, track and field, swimming, basketball, skiing, military pentathlon, and also added military-focused disciplines such as naval pentathlon, aeronautical pentathlon, and orienteering.Clayton Kershaw, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts â the Los Angeles Dodgers stars all shined.Nothing out of the ordinary there, even if the setting was surreal.Baseball's best team during the pandemic-shortened season showed off its many talents in the first World Series game played at a neutral site, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.With the seats mostly empty, Kershaw dominated for six innings, Bellinger and Betts homered and the Dodgers chased a wild Tyler Glasnow in the fifth inning and coasted home in the opener.A crowd limited by the coronavirus to 11,388 at Globe Life Field, the new $1.2-billion home of the Texas Rangers, marked the smallest for baseball's top event in 111 years.Los Angeles hopes to go home with a title that has eluded the Dodgers since 1988 but tried to guard against focusing ahead."It's hard not to think about winning. It's hard not to think about what that might be like," Kershaw said. "Constantly keep putting that in your brain: tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow. And then you do that three more times, and you can think about it all you want."A regular season star with an erratic postseason history, Kershaw looked like the ace who so often stars on midsummer evenings with the San Gabriel Mountains behind him at Dodger Stadium. With these games shifted, the 32-year-old left-hander wound up pitching not far from his off season home in Dallas.The three-time Cy Young Award winner allowed one run and two hits, struck out eight and walked one. He induced 19 swings and misses among his 78 pitches â more than his three previous Series starts combined."You can appreciate and totally see why he's heading to the Hall of Fame one day whenever he's done," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.Kershaw threw nine balls in the first, when he stranded a pair of runners, then threw just nine more over the next three innings."He had a game plan to try to really quiet down things from there and he executed," said Kevin Kiermaier, who ended Kershaw's streak of 13 retired in a row with a fifth-inning homer on a hanging slider that cut the Rays' deficit to 2-1.Kershaw, a five-time ERA champ, improved to 2-2 in the World Series and 12-12 in postseason play, a shadow of his 175-76 regular season record. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts did not pitch him after Game 4 of the NL Championship Series last Thursday."I think we were going to stay away from him in Game 7 just for this particular reason," Roberts said.Game 2 is Wednesday night. The Dodgers, who posted the best record in the majors during the shortened season and showed off all their stars in Game 1, plan to throw a collection of pitchers started by Tony Gonsolin against Rays ace Blake Snell.Eight of the last 10 teams to win Game 1 went on the title, all except the 2016 Indians and 2017 Dodgers.Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP who began the opener with a career .114 batting average in 12 World Series games, had put the Dodgers ahead in the fourth with a two-run homer off Glasnow, having no trouble driving a 98 mph pitch into the Dodgers bullpen in right-center.Bellinger, whose seventh-inning homer put the Dodgers ahead in Game 7 of the NL Championship on Sunday, shuffled his feet, tapping gently as he crossed the plate and celebrated by toe tapping teammates while dancing back to the dugout, a sign he remembered popping his right shoulder during raucous revelry two nights earlier.He capped his evening by leaping at the 6-foot center field wall in the ninth, robbing Austin Meadows of a possible home run."I said it today before the game: If I hit one I'm not touching anybody's arm," Bellinger said. "I'm going straight foot, and it was pretty funny."Betts, brilliant throughout October but slumping at the plate, added his first postseason homer for the Dodgers, an opposite-field solo shot to right in the sixth off Josh Fleming.Betts had two hits, scored two runs and stole two bases in the four-run fifth, when Corey Seager swiped one as Los Angeles became the first team to steal three bases in a Series inning since the 1912 New York Giants in Game 5 against Boston."That's a weak spot of my game, holding runners," Glasnow said. "Has to be something I focus on more in the future. "Betts became the first to hit a home run, steal two bases and score twice in a Series game."Stolen bases are a thing for me. That's how I create runs and create havoc on the basepaths," he said.Los Angeles is in the Series for the third time in four years but seeking its first title since the Kirk Gibson- and Orel Hershiser-led team of 32 years ago. Coming off an unusual LCS of games on seven straight days, the Dodgers planned an all-bullpen outing for the next game.Tampa Bay was held to six hits. Its only previous Series was a five-game loss to Philadelphia in 2008.Glasnow was chased after 4 1/3 innings with an ominous pitching line that included three hits, six runs, six walks and eight strikeouts. He threw a career-high 112 pitches and became the first to walk six or more in a series game since Edwin Jackson of St. Louis in Game 4 of 2011. Glasnow went to three-ball counts on 12 of 23 batters.Los Angeles expanded its lead to 4-1 in the fifth, when Cash left Glasnow in to face left-handed-hitting Max Muncy with runners at the corners. Muncy hit a one-hopper to first baseman Yandy DÃ­az with the infield in, and Betts beat a strong but slightly offline throw with a headfirst slide past catcher Mike Zunino.Will Smith finished Glasnow with an RBI single, and Chris Taylor and pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez followed with run-scoring singles off Ryan Yarbrough for a 6-1 lead.Justin Turner and Muncy doubled on consecutive pitches in the sixth.Pinch-hitter Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs in the seventh against Victor Gonzalez, who snagged Zunino's line drive and doubled Brosseau off second base for an inning-ending double play.After a regular season played without fans, MLB resumed selling tickets with a limited amount for the NLCS at Globe Life and kept that up by allowing about 28 percent of capacity to be filled at the 40,518-seat ballpark, where the roof was open. The crowd was widely dispersed throughout and was the smallest for the Series since 10,535 attended Game 6 between the Pirates and Tigers at Detroit's Bennett Park in 1909, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.An overwhelming majority of fans wore Dodger blue."They're everywhere. They always come out," Kershaw said. "And so for as much as a game as we would have liked it to have been at Dodger Stadium and the 56,000 chanting, after everything that's gone on this season, to have 10-, 11,000 people in the stands and a good bit of them being Dodger fans is pretty cool."Clayton Kershaw, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts â the Los Angeles Dodgers stars all shined.Nothing out of the ordinary there, even if the setting was surreal.Baseball's best team during the pandemic-shortened season showed off its many talents in the first World Series game played at a neutral site, beating the Tampa Bay Rays 8-3 Tuesday night.With the seats mostly empty, Kershaw dominated for six innings, Bellinger and Betts homered and the Dodgers chased a wild Tyler Glasnow in the fifth inning and coasted home in the opener.A crowd limited by the coronavirus to 11,388 at Globe Life Field, the new $1.2-billion home of the Texas Rangers, marked the smallest for baseball's top event in 111 years.Los Angeles hopes to go home with a title that has eluded the Dodgers since 1988 but tried to guard against focusing ahead."It's hard not to think about winning. It's hard not to think about what that might be like," Kershaw said. "Constantly keep putting that in your brain: tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow, win tomorrow. And then you do that three more times, and you can think about it all you want."A regular season star with an erratic postseason history, Kershaw looked like the ace who so often stars on midsummer evenings with the San Gabriel Mountains behind him at Dodger Stadium. With these games shifted, the 32-year-old left-hander wound up pitching not far from his off season home in Dallas.The three-time Cy Young Award winner allowed one run and two hits, struck out eight and walked one. He induced 19 swings and misses among his 78 pitches â more than his three previous Series starts combined."You can appreciate and totally see why he's heading to the Hall of Fame one day whenever he's done," Rays manager Kevin Cash said.Kershaw threw nine balls in the first, when he stranded a pair of runners, then threw just nine more over the next three innings."He had a game plan to try to really quiet down things from there and he executed," said Kevin Kiermaier, who ended Kershaw's streak of 13 retired in a row with a fifth-inning homer on a hanging slider that cut the Rays' deficit to 2-1.Kershaw, a five-time ERA champ, improved to 2-2 in the World Series and 12-12 in postseason play, a shadow of his 175-76 regular season record. Dodgers manager Dave Roberts did not pitch him after Game 4 of the NL Championship Series last Thursday."I think we were going to stay away from him in Game 7 just for this particular reason," Roberts said.Game 2 is Wednesday night. The Dodgers, who posted the best record in the majors during the shortened season and showed off all their stars in Game 1, plan to throw a collection of pitchers started by Tony Gonsolin against Rays ace Blake Snell.Eight of the last 10 teams to win Game 1 went on the title, all except the 2016 Indians and 2017 Dodgers.Bellinger, the 2019 NL MVP who began the opener with a career .114 batting average in 12 World Series games, had put the Dodgers ahead in the fourth with a two-run homer off Glasnow, having no trouble driving a 98 mph pitch into the Dodgers bullpen in right-center.Bellinger, whose seventh-inning homer put the Dodgers ahead in Game 7 of the NL Championship on Sunday, shuffled his feet, tapping gently as he crossed the plate and celebrated by toe tapping teammates while dancing back to the dugout, a sign he remembered popping his right shoulder during raucous revelry two nights earlier.He capped his evening by leaping at the 6-foot center field wall in the ninth, robbing Austin Meadows of a possible home run."I said it today before the game: If I hit one I'm not touching anybody's arm," Bellinger said. "I'm going straight foot, and it was pretty funny."Betts, brilliant throughout October but slumping at the plate, added his first postseason homer for the Dodgers, an opposite-field solo shot to right in the sixth off Josh Fleming.Betts had two hits, scored two runs and stole two bases in the four-run fifth, when Corey Seager swiped one as Los Angeles became the first team to steal three bases in a Series inning since the 1912 New York Giants in Game 5 against Boston."That's a weak spot of my game, holding runners," Glasnow said. "Has to be something I focus on more in the future. "Betts became the first to hit a home run, steal two bases and score twice in a Series game."Stolen bases are a thing for me. That's how I create runs and create havoc on the basepaths," he said.Los Angeles is in the Series for the third time in four years but seeking its first title since the Kirk Gibson- and Orel Hershiser-led team of 32 years ago. Coming off an unusual LCS of games on seven straight days, the Dodgers planned an all-bullpen outing for the next game.Tampa Bay was held to six hits. Its only previous Series was a five-game loss to Philadelphia in 2008.Glasnow was chased after 4 1/3 innings with an ominous pitching line that included three hits, six runs, six walks and eight strikeouts. He threw a career-high 112 pitches and became the first to walk six or more in a series game since Edwin Jackson of St. Louis in Game 4 of 2011. Glasnow went to three-ball counts on 12 of 23 batters.Los Angeles expanded its lead to 4-1 in the fifth, when Cash left Glasnow in to face left-handed-hitting Max Muncy with runners at the corners. Muncy hit a one-hopper to first baseman Yandy DÃ­az with the infield in, and Betts beat a strong but slightly offline throw with a headfirst slide past catcher Mike Zunino.Will Smith finished Glasnow with an RBI single, and Chris Taylor and pinch-hitter Kike Hernandez followed with run-scoring singles off Ryan Yarbrough for a 6-1 lead.Justin Turner and Muncy doubled on consecutive pitches in the sixth.Pinch-hitter Mike Brosseau and Kiermaier singled in runs in the seventh against Victor Gonzalez, who snagged Zunino's line drive and doubled Brosseau off second base for an inning-ending double play.After a regular season played without fans, MLB resumed selling tickets with a limited amount for the NLCS at Globe Life and kept that up by allowing about 28 percent of capacity to be filled at the 40,518-seat ballpark, where the roof was open. The crowd was widely dispersed throughout and was the smallest for the Series since 10,535 attended Game 6 between the Pirates and Tigers at Detroit's Bennett Park in 1909, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.An overwhelming majority of fans wore Dodger blue."They're everywhere.

According to ESPN, Bjorkgren signed a multi-year deal with the Pacers.Bjorkgren, 45, was the assistant under Nick Nurse, named the NBA Coach of the Year last season in the Toronto Raptors. He also had years of experience coach NBA D-League teams."We are very pleased and excited to have Nate as our new coach. This was an extensive and thorough search, and when we reached the conclusion, we felt strongly Nate is the right coach for us at the right time. He comes from a winning background, has experienced championship success, is innovative, and his communication skills, along with his positivity, are tremendous. We all look forward to a long, successful partnership in helping the Pacers move forward," said Kevin Pritchard, president of basketball operations of the Pacers, in a statement."I am honored to take on the role as head coach of the Indiana Pacers. This is something I have prepared for during my career. I want to thank Kevin, Chad (Buchanan), Kelly (Krauskopf), Larry Bird, Donnie Walsh, and Herb and Steve Simon for this opportunity. I also want to thank Nick Nurse for giving me my first professional coaching job 14 years ago. I'm looking forward to working with this great team to achieve our goal as NBA Champions."Bjorkgren's creative thinking began to draw attention after he suggested Nurse use "Box-1 defense" on Stephen Curry in Game 2 of the NBA Finals between the Raptors and the Golden State Warriors last year. The ingenious move worked as Curry failed to even take one attempt in the last quarter of G2. In the end, the Raptors defeated the Warriors 4-2 to win their first NBA Championship in franchise history.Of course, that does not mean Bjokgren's new job will be easy at the Bankers Life Fieldhouse. The Pacers made the NBA playoffs for the fifth straight time in the past 2019-20 season and were eliminated for the fifth time in a row. Moreover, they were swept out in both 2019 and 2020.The Pacers wanted breakthroughs, and they were capable of getting it if they were healthy â injuries had been haunting the team for years. Meanwhile, Bjorkgren may have a better chance of leading the Pacers to achieve a breakthrough if he can help Victor Oladipo find the best himself back. The 28-year-old two-time All-Star guard still has one year left of his contract with the deal, and he already rejected the four-year, 80-million-U.S.-dollar contract extension offer by the Pacers. If he can fully recover from injury and reproduces his incredible performance two years ago in the new season, it will benefit both himself and the Pacers.The Indiana Pacers have appointed Nate Bjorkgren as their new head coach, announced the team on Tuesday.

The English top league was said to have five candidates and it's unclear which of the "Big 6" will be left behind.Kleinman said that the financiers are trying to raise a $6 billion funding package and are negotiating with JP Morgan.

Its games will take place during the seasons of other national leagues and each team will play at least 30 games on a format of round-robin home and away fixtures.

rule violation after a World Athletics Disciplinary Tribunal dismissed charges brought against her for registering four "whereabouts failures."The 22-year-old, who won gold at the World Championships in Doha last year, was charged and provisionally suspended by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) in June.According to World Athletics Anti-Doping Rules, any combination of three whereabouts failures â filing failures or missed tests â within a 12-month period by an athlete constitutes an anti-doping violation.Athletes guilty of whereabouts failures could face two-year bans or a minimum of one year depending on the degree of fault.In Naser's case, the disciplinary tribunal upheld three of the four AIU charges against her â a filing failure effective Jan. 1, 2019 and two missed tests, on March 12 last year and January 24 this year.However, the tribunal found in Naser's favor with regard to a third alleged missed test on April 12, 2019, which resulted in the charges being dismissed because her three whereabouts failures did not occur within a 12-month rolling period."This was a case very much on the borderline and we hope the athlete will learn from the experience and heed the

Weihai, east China's Shandong Province, between November 8 and 10.This rule change is no good news for China, which sent Chen Meng and Sun Yingsha to attend the event. Chen and Sun are the No. 1 and No. 3 seeds based on their current world rankings. Meanwhile, China's biggest rival Mima Ito from Japan, is the No. 2 seed. That means Chen and Ito will be in different divisions, but there's no telling which division Sun will end in.If Chen and Sun meet before the final match, one of them has to go, and that will be in Ito's favor. Both Chen and Sun hold an advantageous record over Ito in the past competitions. The last time Chen met Ito happened at the Qatar Open in March. Chen came back from a 1-0 trail and defeated Ito 4-1 in the women's singles final match, winning the gold and claiming her fourth straight victory over Ito.Sun does not fear Ito either. She achieved a 3-2 win over Ito, coming back from a 2-0 trail at the ITTF Team World Cu last year. Sun also beat Ito 4-1 in the ITTF German Open in last October. Ito even shed tears after the loss.All three will make their singles World Cup debut in November, and each of them is eying for the first tile of the event in her career.

As the event is the first since the start of COVID-19 pandemic, the coach said the squad is focusing on their weaknesses, including by increasing strength training. "We work on the weakness or weak events, such as vault or floor exercise, everything will not happen overnight, but the team works hard together every day."Reflecting on his coaching accomplishments around the world, the 52-year-old said he enjoyed coming back to China and was honored to have a chance to guide the Chinese women's squad. "This great team has a lot of good traditions, we just have to keep building on physical ability."The Beijing native also shared several aspects of his approach to coaching. "I think there is no magic word to any sport," the World Cup winner said. "The hard work has to be done every single day. I think the hard part is keeping the athletes healthy, and also enjoying their hard work. I think that's the art of coaching."Coach Qiao is also looking to help the women's squad earn medals for China.

Deng finished the climb in 6.987 seconds, but Niu was even faster to reach the summit in 6.819 seconds. Both beat the world record (7.088 seconds) for women's speed climbing set by Aries Susanti Rahayu from Indonesia. However, since there were no officials from the International Federation of Sport Climbing to monitor the event because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the performance of Niu will not be recognized as a new world record.At the beginning of this month, snooker legend Stephen Hendry came out of retirement after eight years and accepted an invitational tour card to compete on the World Snooker Tour for at least the next two seasons. Previously, the seven-time world champion, who is nicknamed "King of Crucible" and "Emperor of Snooker," spoke to Sports Scene's Wang Dong.The 51-year-old retired in 2012, having slipped out of the World Championship at the quarter-final stage, and also making a 147 break in the event that year. Hendry felt that he might have played longer, but he left public because he wasn't playing well enough to win. "For me, the whole pleasure of playing snooker is to win, when I didn't have the success, I didn't enjoy that much," Hendry said in the interview.Even though the Scot has been away from playing on the main circuit, he has remained around the game as his passion remains in the sport. He's working as a commentator and ambassador for snooker around the world, especially in China. He emphasized that China is one of his favorite places and a big part of his career. He also gave thanks to all his Chinese fans for their support, saying he was flattered by the nickname "Emperor of Snooker."Hendry returned as a player on the 2020 World Seniors Snooker Championship in August, and a link-up with renowned coach Stephen Feeney has spurred him on to have another crack at the main tour. After receiving the invitational tour card, his return seems more realizable this time.When asked his assessment of current players, the snooker legend praised Ding Junhui, who is considered the most successful Asian player in history. "Ding and O'Sullivan have the best cue ball control", the Scot said. "I love Ding as a player, his game is incredible. He should have already won the World Championship because he has everything in his game, but I question if he has the hunger."He also shared his thoughts about Ronnie O'Sullivan's record-breaking success over him. "I wouldn't be happy, I have to be honest if Ronnie broke my record, but he still has to win another two," Hendry said of "The Rocket." The 44-year-old regained the title in Sheffield and is now only one behind Hendry's record seven world titles.Yan Xiaonan is one of the only two ranked Chinese female mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). She currently ranks 10th under the dominance of UFC women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili and, next month at UFC 253, Yan will face Claudia Gadelha from Brazil, with a victory likely to earn her a championship ticket.To earn her #10 position, the 31-year-old beat Poland's Karolina Kowalkiewicz by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night Auckland on February 23 this year.Yan's half-year-older opponent Gadelha comes into the fight on a shorter break, having just won her last fight against Angela Hill by split decision on May 16 at UFC Fight Night in Jacksonville, Florida.'Zhang didn't submit Jedrzejczyk, and I want to achieve that'Yan Xiaonan was the first female Chinese fighter to enter the Octagon. She signed a four-match contact with the UFC and had her first fight on November 25, 2017 at Fight Night Shanghai, eight months before current women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili.During the past four years, Yan has bagged five unanimous decision wins over Kailin Curran, Viviane Pereira, Syuri Kondo, Angela Hill, and Karolina Kowalkiewicz; Zhang also has five wins in this time, but with two submissions and one split decision. Yan's current record is significantly slimmer than that of Zhang, however. Yan is currently on 12-1 with one no contest, while Zhang is 21-1 and undefeated in her last 20. Both of them have a knock out (KO) rate of around 45 percent, but Yan's style has been more focused on striking in recent years.If Yan wins this fight, she would be a championship contender and could take part in the first UFC "China Derby" with Zhang.When asked about whom she'd like to fight the most, Yan said it's Joanna Jedrzejczyk: "Zhang Weili didn't submit her, and I want to achieve that."The fight between Zhang and Joanna is already considered the best female fight in MMA history by many. Zhang won a split decision after five fierce rounds against Joanna and, ever since that incredible victory, Zhang has become a superstar in China. Zhang and Yan both have sanda backgrounds, but when asked about their difference, Yan showed a smile and said, "Zhang's figure is more like Gadelha, and I'm taller.""For Zhang's next fight, which is probably to be made with Rose Namajunas, I think Zhang will win as Rose is not as strong as Jedrzejczyk. And if I win my fight with Gadelha, I think the China Derby will happen soon," Yan said when asked about what she expects from her future.Zhang is already an active champion, but she can't rest on her laurels with another Chinese contender rising through the ranks. Yan said, "I'm well prepared any time, but only if Dana White gives me an opportunity."'Gadelha is a BJJ black belt, I'm striking level 10'Yan Xiaonan passed a 14-day quarantine after coming back from Auckland and has trained consistently since. About the fight against Gadelha, she feels very confident, "I met her twice when I was training in Las Vegas, and I've also watched many videos of her fights. I know her very well." "My Brazilian Jiu-jitsu (BJJ) coach is from Brazil, and he'd always like me to fight against her, so, we're preparing everything well, especially the strategy that my BJJ coach set for me," Yan added.Yan's coach Ruy Menezes is one of the first generation of BJJ practitioners in China. He got a black belt from the Gracie Family in 2002 and came to China for the first time in the following year. Ruy began to teach Jiu-Jitsu in Beijing in 2009, and he trained China's first UFC fighter Zhang Tiequan, as well as Li Jiangliang, Yan Xiaonan, and many other mixed martial artists.But due to the pandemic of COVID-19, he has been staying in Brazil and may not go to the UFC 253 to be the cornerman for Yan."Recently, my conditioning coach has trained me a lot on my explosive power and one-punch KO ability, but my head coach told me the most important thing is to win the whole match," Yan said."Gadelha is BJJ black belt, much higher than me, and she will definitely try to drag me to the canvas since the very beginning, but people said my standing skills are 'level 10'," the former professional sanda athlete said with a laugh."Gadelha has very good stamina and defence, she'd never been submitted, even after facing Jedrzejczyk twice. For this fight, I'll still focus on the entirety of match, as well try to find a KO opportunity, I believe I can do it."'Usually I'm quiet, but "Fury" in the Octagon'Yan said she's very excited about having the chance to fight a top-10 fighter but also worried about her team's safety due to traveling during the COVID-19 pandemic. The host venue for the fight has not been decided yet but probably in the Fight Island, but her team was asked to go to the United States next week, then go to Abu Dhabi from there by UFC private flight. They won't quarantine in the U.S."The condition out of China is worse than here, but professional sports are like this, athletes cannot take long rests, and my life has to go ahead," Yan said in a matter-of-fact way.Compared with Zhang, Yan is much less outgoing. She speaks simply, but that doesn't mean she isn't confident: "Every athlete trains to become the champion, if I don't want to be the champion, I wouldn't be an athlete."At the end of the interview, Yan was asked which of her nicknames she likes the most, and she said it's "Fury" and explained, "Usually, I'm quiet and do not like speak, but when I get into training and stand in the Octagon, I'm crazy, like being injected with chicken blood (Chinese proverb about getting invigorated). I just love the stage!"Yan Xiaonan is one of the only two ranked Chinese female mixed martial arts (MMA) fighters in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC). She currently ranks 10th under the dominance of UFC women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili and, next month at UFC 253, Yan will face Claudia Gadelha from Brazil, with a victory likely to earn her a championship ticket.To earn her #10 position, the 31-year-old beat Poland's Karolina Kowalkiewicz by unanimous decision at UFC Fight Night Auckland on February 23 this year.Yan's half-year-older opponent Gadelha comes into the fight on a shorter break, having just won her last fight against Angela Hill by split decision on May 16 at UFC Fight Night in Jacksonville, Florida.'Zhang didn't submit Jedrzejczyk, and I want to achieve that'Yan Xiaonan was the first female Chinese fighter to enter the Octagon. She signed a four-match contact with the UFC and had her first fight on November 25, 2017 at Fight Night Shanghai, eight months before current women's strawweight champion Zhang Weili.During the past four years, Yan has bagged five unanimous decision wins over Kailin Curran, Viviane Pereira, Syuri Kondo, Angela Hill, and Karolina Kowalkiewicz; Zhang also has five wins in this time, but with two submissions and one split decision. Yan's current record is significantly slimmer than that of Zhang, however. Yan is currently on 12-1 with one no contest, while Zhang is 21-1 and undefeated in her last 20. Both of them have a knock out (KO) rate of around 45 percent, but Yan's style has been more focused on striking in recent years.If Yan wins this fight, she would be a championship contender and could take part in the first UFC "China Derby" with Zhang.When asked about whom she'd like to fight the most, Yan said it's Joanna Jedrzejczyk: "Zhang Weili didn't submit her, and I want to achieve that."The fight between Zhang and Joanna is already considered the best female fight in MMA history by many. Zhang won a split decision after five fierce rounds against Joanna and, ever since that incredible victory, Zhang has become a superstar in China. Zhang and Yan both have sanda backgrounds, but when asked about their difference, Yan showed a smile and said, "Zhang's figure is more like Gadelha, and I'm taller.""For Zhang's next fight, which is probably to be made with Rose Namajunas, I think Zhang will win as Rose is not as strong as Jedrzejczyk. And if I win my fight with Gadelha, I think the China Derby will happen soon," Yan said when asked about what she expects from her future.Zhang is already an active champion, but she can't rest on her laurels with another Chinese contender rising through the ranks.

I just love the stage!"After a shutdown of exactly five months due to the outbreak of COVID-19, the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) restarted on the afternoon of June 20. But, like most of the other recently rebooted professional sports leagues in the world, there was no audience at the venue â even the cheerleaders could only perform via an LED screen beside the court.Around two million messages were left by the audience on the Tencent Sports app during their livestream of the game between the Nanjing Monkey Kings and Zhejiang Lions showing people were excited for the return of basketball, but the two on-site commentators still had to ask each other "do you feel excited?" and try to create a positive vibe in the otherwise silent arena.On one hand, playing games behind closed doors is disappointing for fans who wanted to see the game live in the area, but on the other, the situation has led to the CBA regularly broadcasting their games in virtual reality (VR) â like what the NBA has been doing since 2014 â giving the home audience an immersive experience.By cooperating with China Mobile's Migu Video, the CBA lets the audience watch game live in VR, either on their smartphones or with a special headset, from different angles provided by 16 camera stands. The technology also allows fans to show their broadcast themselves in real-time on courtside screens.At the moment, it is easy for a league to broadcast live games in VR, but the penetration of VR devices in the target audiences is still low around the world due to reasons such as the high expense and often inconvenient user experience.Nevertheless, if holding live events behind closed doors becomes a common practice in the post-pandemic age â a period which may last for a relatively long time â will the large-scale application of 5G technology and the live streaming industry's boom on digital platforms combine to make virtual viewing a major component of modern sports?Traditional sports becoming eSportsDuring the pandemic, the world's major professional sports leagues had to pause, and so sports TV channels could only broadcast old games and events. Because of this, livestreams of eSport equivalents became a realistic alternative for fans.Because sports evolved from games, many video games can simulate real sports to a high degree, and some of them also have eSports leagues, like EA Sports' FIFA series, which is a yearly must-buy for a lot of gamers.In fact, some of the more expensive sports, have already been using simulators for a long while. Formula One (F1) is a major example of this, and as racing â in terms of both simulation and arcade styles â is a major genre of video games, F1 games are easily accepted by diehard fans and a wider audience too.F1 Virtual Grand Prix launched an official global league in 2017 and, during the pandemic, many F1 racers joined to stay busy but also keep their skills sharp. And by competing online, many developed closer bonds with their fans.According to an article released by the Ministry of Sports on June 22, F1 Virtual Grand Prix eSports series eclipsed 30 million views on TV and digital platforms combined during the COVID-19 lockdown.The number evidently cannot compete with the trillions of cumulative viewers for the real F1 Grand Prix series in 2019, but it's still a significant result for eSports.Basketball game NBA 2K got a peak number of around 14,000 simultaneous viewers in a live competition which was held with real NBA stars on March 31. FIBA used this as the basis for setting up the international FIBA eSports Open 2020 which was held for the first time ever from June 19 to 21.While it is true that it is becoming more popular for professional leagues to move their offline contests online, when sports lose their physicality, to a large extent, they also lose their essence.Smart sports equipmentMost sports events and exercises must be played with specific equipment, and currently, more and more fitness equipment, whether found in professional gyms or at home, can be combined with video games, like some treadmill and spinning bikes that connect with screens and turn users' workout data into virtual scenes.To get in on the trend, some video game developers are also creating motion sensing peripherals to push their players into getting physical.To give a recent example, Nintendo's Ring Fit Adventure on the Switch platform has become a smash hit during the pandemic, as people can use its ring-shaped peripheral to play a game and keep fit at the same time.Combining exercise with video games dates back to expensive American gyms in the 1980s. But now, motion sensing apps for yoga, dancing, running, cycling and other solo exercises are very common worldwide.However, on an industry-wide level, as sports are all about being "Faster, Higher, Stronger" and differ from exercise by being based in competition and confrontation, to create authentic experiences, sports game developers should consider creating products that allow people to do head-to-head or team sports in small, isolated spaces.Playing sports with X-realityIn the world of Steven Spielberg's 2018 movie "Ready Player One", people from all around the world can use custom avatars to play with and against each other in the same virtual world by using wearable technology.To a certain degree at present, that is already possible: people can walk on omni-direction treadmills or be suspended in midair on wires to expand their active range in a virtual world, and also some helmet or armor-like clothing can let you feel vibrations, heat and wind.This method of playing sports fits the post-pandemic age, but at the moment, it can only be realized in large, public areas such as the shopping malls, arcades and amusement parks due to the size and cost of the equipment.But, even if this were to become readily accessible on a consumer level, it still raises a question: Are gamers satisfied with just simulating traditional sports?A Japanese company has created an innovative team game called HADO with augmented reality (AR) technology. Through the headset's screen, players can see a game world and their human opponents at the same time, and by doing gestures while wearing the arm sensor, players can perform attacking and defensive moves with virtual fireballs and shields.During the pandemic, HADO launched a new project called HADO Xball, which is like a reality show happening behind closed doors. Inspired by Asian hip-hop culture, the players move around like dancers or stuntmen on the set of a martial arts movie and the audience, watching the livestreams from anywhere, can give energy to their favorite players by shaking their phone, increases the interactivity between users and making the impact of "the twelfth man" more direct than ever possible in real world sports.The potential of X-reality is huge, and the market is burgeoning too as the technology is already used in some areas to improve productivity, and many electronic equipment manufacturers such as Apple intend to put AR glasses on sale in the next few years.Chinese mobile company Huawei also launched a cross platform real time Kung Fu game experience powered by Huawei 5G. In the advertisement video, a Kung Fu master equipped with all kinds of sensors remotely fights head-to-head with an eSports gamer.As the slogan of Huawei 5G Kung Fu Showdown is "The pain feels real in 5G," perhaps one day soon, people can get the feeling of playing real sports in the virtual world.(Cover photo designed by Li Chenqi)Zheng Guohua is a 17-year-old middle-distance runner from Tumed Left Banner in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. For the past four years, she has been coached by her father Zheng Long.Father and daughter get up at 4 a.m. every day to train on the road. Dad rides a motorbike and wears flashlights to light up his daughter's predawn route.Because he wants her to maintain her physical condition during the bitter winter months, Long came up with the ingenious idea of building a "home gym" â from discarded items such as used tires and wire.She is very thankful for what her father has done for her.When she's tired of training, she seeks inspiration from his motto, "You can get superman rewards only by making superman efforts."Guohua has won a lot of races and has a best time of 2:28 in the 800 meters â an improvement of 33 seconds over the last three years.Father and daughter have also raised over 6,000 yuan by selling bricks that they picked up on the street. The family, which has a monthly income of just 4,000 yuan, sent all of it to a local charity during the COVID-19 pandemic.(Video Editor: Li Chenqi)Wasps will play in the Gallagher Premiership final against newly-crowned European champions Exeter Chiefs, Premiership Rugby announced on Wednesday.The announcement came after the club received no additional positive cases in the latest round of Covid-19 testing."Everyone at Premiership Rugby is delighted to confirm Wasps' place in the Final after the latest round of tests as part of our PCR COVID-19 screening programme," a statement from Premiership Rugby read in part.Wasps' participation was in serious doubt after the club confirmed four more positive tests on Monday, in addition to the seven reported last Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 11.This means that Challenge Cup winners Bristol Bears, who were comprehensively defeated by Wasps in the semi-final nearly two weeks ago, will not have to replace them in the game.Wasps group chief executive Stephen Vaughan thanked Rugby Football Union (RFU), Premiership Rugby and Public Health England officials for their "clarity and assistance" throughout the entire process."As a club, we are delighted that we can now take our rightful place in this Saturday's Premiership Rugby final. To all of our fans and well-wishers, thank you for your many messages of support, this final is for you."The Premiership final, which will be a rematch of the 2017 final won by Exeter, is set to take place on Saturday, October 24, at Twickenham.(With input from agencies)Wasps will play in the Gallagher Premiership final against newly-crowned European champions Exeter Chiefs, Premiership Rugby announced on Wednesday.The announcement came after the club received no additional positive cases in the latest round of Covid-19 testing."Everyone at Premiership Rugby is delighted to confirm Wasps' place in the Final after the latest round of tests as part of our PCR COVID-19 screening programme," a statement from Premiership Rugby read in part.Wasps' participation was in serious doubt after the club confirmed four more positive tests on Monday, in addition to the seven reported last Wednesday, taking the total number of cases to 11.This means that Challenge Cup winners Bristol Bears, who were comprehensively defeated by Wasps in the semi-final nearly two weeks ago, will not have to replace them in the game.Wasps group chief executive Stephen Vaughan thanked Rugby Football Union (RFU), Premiership Rugby and Public Health England officials for their "clarity and assistance" throughout the entire process."As a club, we are delighted that we can now take our rightful place in this Saturday's Premiership Rugby final.

The game against Paris Saint-Germain wasn't smooth sailing yet even a loss wouldn't have tainted their reputation as clearly being the best club team in Europe as they had steamrolled everyone on their way to the final, including the now infamous 8-2 mauling of FC Barcelona.When Hans-Dieter "Hansi" Flick was appointed as Bayern manager on November 3, 2019, a "new manager bounce" was expected. After all, the side had been floundering under Niko Kovac, so the only way could be up; what nobody really expected was for Bayern to bounce up into the stratosphere.Since Flick arrived last year, the team have won 39 games, lost only three times and drawn exactly once, and the Champions League victory joined a romp through the Bundesliga and the DFB-Pokal (German league cup) to bring the team a historic treble.Flick's aggressive style of play and the overall team consistency made Bayern look like they would rule the roost for years to come, and normally they would, but this is 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has turned football on its head and, for Bayern, that has played out in a heavily foreshortened season.There was less than a month between their Champions League win last season and the start of this new one and Bayern Munich's fatigue has showed, most notably in a shock 4-1 loss to TSG 1899 Hoffenheim on September 27. Not only that but last week, the team had two games in 48 hours: a DFB-Pokal game on October 15 and then a Bundesliga game on October 17.This would be fine if Flick had a squad he could rotate through but this summer's transfer window has sapped the Bayern bench. The main loss is midfield maestro Thiago who has moved to Liverpool. Ivan Perisic and Philippe Coutinho returning to their home clubs doesn't help in that area either, especially when the big signings â Leroy Sane, Douglas Costa, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting â are all attackers. Plus, Serge Gnabry, the team's second highest scorer behind Robert Lewandowski last year, has been ruled out of the game due to testing positive for COVID-19.This puts Bayern at a severe disadvantage in tonight's game against Atletico Madrid; not because of the type of weakness but simply because it is a weakness. If there's one manager in all of football who loves to exploit the flaws of opponents, it's the cruel and callous Diego Simeone.Atletico's previous Champions League campaign shows how tactically villainous he can be. Against defending champions Liverpool, once his team took the early lead in the first leg, Atletico played to maintain it by any means necessary. Ten men behind the ball, cynical fouls, possession for the sake of possession; his Atletico will do anything to grind out a result. And now, with the arrival of ex-Barcelona man Luis Suarez, Simeone has a player as notoriously black hearted as himself.After that sensational defeat of Liverpool, Atletico went on to lose to RB Leipzig in the knockout quarterfinals, demonstrating that their tactics are an all-or-nothing gamble. Against a massive side like Bayern Munich, it's a risk, but it could also be their key to victory.When Bayern Munich won last season's Champions League in August, it was something of an inevitability.

In the build up, Manchester United vs. Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) was considered a big game. The zillionaire champions of France vs. the resurgent English bronze medalists. The realpolitik on the night was very different: an empty stadium under a downpour on a chilly Parisian October night set the tone from the very beginning.Limp and lifeless, for the duration â but especially the early goings â this blockbuster fixture could have been passed off as a pre-season friendly. PSG manager Thomas Tuchel had an excuse as most of his star players were out with injuries. What can't be excused was how he seemingly did nothing to mitigate that on the field.PSG's formation is akin to an accordion. Playing in a 4-3-3 formation, that back four tend to stay rigid in front of their goalkeeper, becoming a back seven when necessary. Those three midfielders who dropped back then usually spring forward and push up the pitch to slightly beyond the halfway line where the front three of Neymar, Kylian Mbappe and Angel di Maria wait deep. They like to play with space; di Maria to fire in crosses, Neymar and Mbappe to use their incredible pace.This works when you have a full squad firing on both flanks. Without midfielders Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes out due to injury and Marquinhos, technically a center-back but a genuine box-to-box maverick, unavailable also, PSG had practically no service going forwards.To make matters worse, Manchester United looked like they had forgone the concept of formations altogether. Their 3-4-1-2 does leave plenty of space around Bruno Fernandes â the "1" â but their focus on overloading man-to-man defense created scenarios where Fernandes, Scott McTominay, Aaron Wan-Bissaka, Victor Lindelof and Axel Tuanzebe would smother Neymar and, in the process, leave roughly a third of the pitch for PSG to play in.This bizarre combination, played out a low-effort slow motion, eliminated almost all attacking link-up play so it's not a surprise that the first two goals came from dead ball scenarios and individual errors. In the 20th minute, Anthony Martial was fouled in the box by Abdou Diallo giving United a penalty. Fernandes took it with a hop, skip and a kick into the bottom right corner â only to have it saved by goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Navas, however, was off his line so it was taken again. Fernandes took it with a hop, skip and a kick into the bottom right corner and made it 1-0.Ten minutes into the second half, PSG got a corner and Neymar fired it into the United box. Martial, the closest to Neymar and completely unhurried by opponents, leapt up, closed his eyes and headed it into his own goal while badly trying to defend.At 1-1 and with half an hour left, the game began to look like a real match. Idrissa Gueye and Ander Herrera getting swapped out for Moise Kean and Rafinha lit a spark in PSG and they started to pose a genuine threat going forward; Manchester United's substitution of Alex Telles for Paul Pogba ended up being a game changer.As play opened up in the final stretch, Marcus Rashford found himself with acres of space around the PSG box and had several attempts on goal. The one trend that remained is that these were either individual efforts or clumsy attempts at link-up play. In both cases he was repeatedly snuffed out by Diallo and Presnel Kimpembe.As the clock ticked down and this agonizing display looked to be headed to a 1-1 draw, Pogba, who had been active from the moment he came on, played a short cross to Rashford who turned, ran into the gap between Danilo Pereira and Pablo Sarabia and smashed it diagonally into the bottom left corner.With only three minutes to go, Rashford won the game for United in Paris, just as he did one year ago with the extra time penalty that knocked PSG out of the 2018/19 tournament. Not an exciting or entertaining victory, but an important one for United nonetheless. With current Bundesliga leaders RB Leipzig in the same group, Rashford's goal could be crucial in getting his side through to the knockouts.Context is important.

I will only take part in a tournament when I am 100% fit. "At the moment, it looks like I can make my comeback at the Australian Open in January."While he has made significant progress in his recovery, he said he is still not at the point where he can train as usual. "Not yet, more than two hours with the racket are not possible at the moment," said Federer, who is currently ranked fourth in the world and saw Rafa Nadal equal his Grand Slam haul with a 13th French Open title this month. "But I've been working on my stamina and strength absolutely without pain for a while. There will be no further operations."Federer is often asked about his retirement plans, but the Swiss said he would keep playing as long as he was enjoying it. "I have been thinking about ideas for about five years," he said. "But as long as I am having fun and it's right for all of us, I'll keep going."Roger Federer is practicing pain-free after undergoing two knee surgeries this year and says he expects to return to the circuit at the Australian Open in January. The 39-year-old Swiss reached the semifinals at Melbourne Park at the start of the year but missed the rest of the season after undergoing a second arthroscopic procedure on his right knee. "I'm on the right track," the 20 times Grand Slam singles champion told German-language magazine Schweizer Illustrierte. "I'm gradually coming back, but I'm going to take my time and don't want to put any pressure on myself.

It isn't just the date that's strange to see, so is the line-up for tonight's match day 1, which includes teams such as Istanbul Basaksehir from the Turkish Superlig, Rennes from France's Ligue 1 and Ferencvaros from Hungary's Nemezti Bajnoksag I (never heard of it either), all of whom are making their Champions League debut or return after decades away.The most reassuring sight is Manchester United of the English Premier League taking on perennial Ligue 1 champions Paris Saint-Germain at the Parc des Princes. Both veterans of the Champions League, the sides have only ever faced each other once before in the tournament: in the 2018/19 season, PSG won the first leg 2-0 then lost the second to United 3-1.Manchester United's qualification for this Champions League campaign was practically decided in the final game of the season. Having spent the 2019 portion of the Premier League balancing wins, losses and draws, the Red Devils went unbeaten from February 1 onwards, eking their way up the table to third place. They also put together a commendable run in the Europa League, where they got knocked out in the semifinal by eventual winners Sevilla.PSG on the other hand have become a perennial competitor in the Champions League ever since they got taken over by the Qatar Sports Investment group. They reached the final of the foreshortened 2019/20 season but were beaten by Bayern Munich.Typically, the finalists should be the favorites when going up against a team that came up from the Europa League, however the manner in which PSG so recently lost could make Manchester United think their opponents are there for the taking. Les Parisiens spent most of the second half acting bratty, playing for fouls and, when they did concede, very clearly mentally crumbled.Not only are they unlikely to have built mental fortitude in barely eight weeks, manager Thomas Tuchel has said he has just 11 healthy players. While he will be pleased that his strike team of Kylian Mbappe and Neymar are fighting fit, confirmed out of this game are regular starters Juan Bernat, Mauro Icardi, Thilo Kehrer, Marco Veratti and Leandro Paredes and Julian Draxler, Marquinhos and Danilo Pereira are expected to start on the bench.Another player missing from the PSG squad is Edinson Cavani, who transferred to Manchester United in the summer transfer window. While he has recently been dealing with his COVID-19 quarantine and not part of the squad in France, United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is also missing captain Harry Maguire, Marcus Rojo and Phil Jones from his standard line up.This would suggest United go into this as the favorites, but their record in the 2020/21 Premier League season has been appalling. A 3-1 loss to Crystal Palace and a spectacular 6-1 capitulation to Tottenham Hotspur sandwich a 3-2 win over Brighton, a game that officially ended 2-2. The referee then decided to restart it because of a VAR decision and award Manchester a penalty officially listed as taking place 10 minutes into added time. Only their 4-1 win over Newcastle last week counts as anything genuinely positive.PSG, whose season started with four games in 10 days, began with two shock losses to Lens and Marseille but have since righted the ship and won the following five by an aggregate of 16-1. The momentum is on their side and if they can put together a team of second stringers to go alongside their world class forwards, they should be able to handle Manchester United, but if United truly give it their best, they could force PSG to break.(Cover image: PSG's Kylian Mbappe and Manchester United's Marcus Rashford during their Champions League game at the Parc des Princes, Paris, France, March 7, 2019. /Getty)Not even two whole months since last season's final in Lisbon, the UEFA Champions League is back.

The new campaign has started and Bayi's opening game against the Beijing Ducks descended into chaos as they failed to turn up, with Beijing Ducks later being declared the winners in a 20-0 forfeit. It still remains to be seen how the CBA will revise its fixture schedule after the official withdrawal of Bayi.The Chinese Basketball Association has confirmed that both the men's and women's team of Bayi Rockets would pull out of the country's professional leagues, ending weeks of speculation over the Nanchang-based giants' future. The CBA recognized Bayi's "indelible contribution to the development of the Chinese basketball" in a public statement on Tuesday, pointing out that their men's and women's sides have managed to "nurture quality players for the national team on a regular basis." Bayi, whose name refers to the date of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in 1927, have been one of the dominant forces in Chinese basketball, winning the CBA eight times since joining the league in 1995. But the once-mighty side gradually plunged into mediocrity after sticking to their tradition of recruiting only Chinese players under a tight budget, while rival teams took advantage of the commercialization of the CBA to make huge investments on high-profile stars and coaches. Bayi hit rock bottom last season after suffering a 13-game losing streak and eventually finished at the foot of the table.

Retrospective punishment can only be considered if an incident was not seen at the time. The verdict has raised further controversy about the decision on the day made by referee Michael Oliver and video assistant referee (VAR) David Coote."Pickford on Van Dijk is a clear challenge that endangers a player with excessive force and should have been deemed a sending-off. A red card should have been issued," former Premier League referee Mark Halsey told BBC. "Why it got missed only the PGMOL (Professional Game Match Officials Board) can tell us that. It's amazing the statement has come out that they didn't recognize it as a red card, serious foul play challenge. I'm astonished," he added. The stance was supported by another former referee, Mark Clattenburg. "Michael Oliver should have been told to look at his monitor by VAR David Coote. Had Oliver done so, I'm sure he would have sent off Jordan Pickford for his challenge on Virgil van Dijk," he told Daily Mail."I've also heard it claimed Pickford could not be dismissed because Van Dijk was offside â rubbish. Oliver had not blown his whistle by the time Pickford lunged in, so he could still have been punished," he observed. "VAR confirming later Van Dijk was offside does not nullify a red. The bottom line is, Coote should have sent Oliver to his monitor. Given Van Dijk was injured, the referee had plenty of time to review the incident." Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp was equally incensed, but his major concern right now is how to deal with Van Dijk's absence."A few things are clear, so he now will be out for a while, that's clear," said Klopp in a press briefing. "We don't want to set any timeframe, to be honest, because each player is different and each individual is different.""So we feel now in this moment extremely, extremely for him because most of us have been in a similar situation and we know that these situations are absolutely rubbish. You don't need it but you have to get over it and Virgil will get over it, 100%, and today is already the first day, if you want, of the recovery," he added. Former defender Jamie Carragher noted that Klopp's side must look to sign a replacement in the January transfer window. "The big question you're looking at now is, can Liverpool win the league without Van Dijk there? I think it blows the title race wide open," the veteran told Sky Sports. "Liverpool have to go into the market in January and not just because of Van Dijk's injury. They were weak in that area anyway.

No time frame has been put on his absence by the club but an injury of this nature could force him on the sidelines for several months and even miss the remainder of the campaign.In an Instagram post on Sunday night, the defender said: "I'm now fully focused on my recovery and will do everything I can to be back as quickly as possible. In football, as in life, I believe everything happens for a reason and it's important to try and keep level headed whether going through the highs and lows."According to Sky Sports, Pickford, who escaped a red card from the referee, attempted to make contact with Van Dijk but has yet to speak to him directly.Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp is yet to speak publicly about the huge blow of losing one of his most reliable players but he questioned why no action was taken against Pickford during his post-game press conference on Saturday."For me it was a clear penalty that I saw. Then obviously we saw the flag went up, so offside. I still thought it was worth a look on the foul but that didn't happen," said Klopp. "We have no power there, we just sit here and you discuss it with me. You have to ask other people about that, not me. What can I say?"Statistics from the BBC show that Van Dijk has missed just one Premier League game since joining Liverpool. He played all 38 Premier League games in 2018/19 as Liverpool conceded just 22 goals. In his 95 Premier League starts for Liverpool, they have conceded just 78 goals and kept 44 clean sheets.In 2019, he was awarded the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA)'s Player of the Year and also became the first defender to pick up UEFA's Player of the Year award.Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury is one of the most severe injuries suffered by players and it requires a recovery period of six to nine months. Zlatan Ibrahimovic's Manchester United career was effectively over after he picked up the ACL injury during their Europa League clash with Anderlecht in 2017.Zlatan's former United teammate Marcos Rojo and Borussia Dortmund talisman Marco Reus also endured the same season-ending injury, but both failed to rediscover their fine form after returning to action.Liverpool's worst fears were confirmed on Sunday as scans revealed that defender Virgil van Dijk had suffered anterior cruciate ligament damage in the Merseyside derby.The Netherlands captain, who has played an important role in Liverpool's title-winning seasons since his arrival from Southampton in January 2018, was injured by a horrible foul from Everton goalkeeper Jordan Pickford just five minutes into the bad-tempered encounter at Goodison Park.Van Dijk had to be substituted and was later sent to hospital for a scan, which revealed he would require surgery.

In the second half, Zall's Song Zhiwei kicked the ball to one of Jianye's players when the game was stalled, almost causing strife. As a result, Song was given a yellow card.Later, Song also committed a foul on Dourado by kicking him down on the ground, but he got away with it. Zall's Eddy Gnahore broke into Jianye's box into Jianye's box and was taken down there in the 64th minute, but no foul was called.The two teams will meet again on October 23.'Shanghai Derby' ends 0-0The CSL defending champions Shanghai SIPG failed to win the "Shanghai Derby" against Shanghai Shenhua in the championship group. Neither side scored anything before the game ended a 0-0 tie.SIPG, as the stronger side, shot 19 times in the game and kept posing threats against Shenhua's goal in the last five minutes. However, Stephane M'Bia and goalkeeper Zeng Cheng managed to keep their net safe. Meanwhile, Li Shenglong, Fu Huan, and He Guan also missed several great scoring opportunities. Yang Xu's header in the 91st minute was only inches away from bringing SIPG a win.SIPG's starting goalkeeper Yan Junling collided with Shenhua's Bi Jinhao in the 36th minute. Yan's head was hit, and the game was paused for nine minutes before Yan was replaced by Chen Wei.Shenhua only tried two shots in the game, and neither of them was on the goal.Henan Jianye edged over Wuhan Zall 1-0 in their first game in the relegation group on Sunday, gaining the upper hand in the competition for the right to stay in the Chinese Super League.Henrique Dourado scored the game-winning goal via a penalty kick for Jianye in the 30th minute after Christian Bassogog created the chance for him. Though he did not score the goal himself, Bassogog gave himself an excellent present for his 25th birthday.This game was not as peaceful as its scoreboard. In the 9th minute, Zall's Liu Yi and Jianye's Fernando Karanga bumped into each other when they competed for a header. Both shed blood. Liu changed a new jersey and had to wear head protection. In the second half, Zall's Song Zhiwei kicked the ball to one of Jianye's players when the game was stalled, almost causing strife. As a result, Song was given a yellow card.Later, Song also committed a foul on Dourado by kicking him down on the ground, but he got away with it.

He believes this separates the UFC from other combat sports leagues, and from the world of contemporary boxing in particular, by keeping competition high and preventing fighters from getting padded resumes.For fans, this is a good thing. For fighters, less so â especially fighters in the position of Brian "T-City" Ortega. Ortega had an undefeated streak of 14-0 with one No Contest that lasted from 2010 to 2018. His loss to then-UFC men's featherweight champion Max Holloway at UFC 231 on December 8, 2018, was due to a doctor's stoppage. It was an anticlimactic end to his hot streak, not so much because of the loss itself, but because it would be the last round Ortega would fight for almost two years.Ortega took almost a year to recuperate from his injuries. During that time, he got into a heated rivalry with Jung Chan-sung, better known to MMA fans as The Korean Zombie (TKZ). Even though it was revealed that it was orchestrated by TKZ's translator Jay Park, it drew a lot of attention, and a fight was signed for UFC Fight Night: Busan on December 21, 2019.An ACL tear forced Ortega to pull out on December 4. That should have been the end of the feud: The trash talk had been revealed to be a put-on, and Ortega was out of action. However, several days later, in an ESPN interview, TKZ said he thought Ortega was ducking him.Certain people in MMA don't take kindly to that sort of banter. Conor McGregor found out the hard way with Khabib Nurmagomedov in the cage, Leon Edwards found out with Jorge Masvidal backstage at UFC Fight Night London, and Jay Park found out when Ortega walked up to him in the crowd and slapped him at UFC 248 on March 7 this year. The hype was now real, and there could only be one fight for Ortega's return.That fight took place at UFC Fight Island 6 on October 18, 2020. After almost two years on the shelf, and with a point to prove, all eyes were on Ortega. The two men are known as brawlers, so it was expected that Ortega would start fast. Instead, Round 1 was almost entirely a feeling out process with Ortega using his jab to set up harder strikes that found their target later into the round.The chess match ended a minute into Round 2 when TKZ sprinted over and tried punch combinations on Ortega's chin. Ortega said he wanted to be "unrecognizable" in this fight, and he showed it. Instead of being drawn into a slugfest, he maintained his composure and built on the jab and jab feints of Round 1 with takedown attempts and feints. TKZ, usually a bulldozer, now looked timid, unsure when to pull the trigger to avoid caught in Ortega's excellent jiujitsu. With barely 60 seconds remaining, he reverted to type and tried another bullrush, only to find himself on the receiving end of a pinpoint reverse elbow.TKZ survived the round, and the remainder of the fight proved "Zombie" isn't just a nickname. It was given to Chan because he's notoriously resilient, but following that second round elbow, he really became dead inside. Even when he had Ortega pinned against the cage, his head was still, and his feet were flat.From there, the only differences in rounds 3, 4 and 5 were how much damage Ortega inflicted on TKZ and how far ahead of him he pulled in terms of points. TKZ only wanted to apply pressure and swing for the fences. Meanwhile, Ortega mixed all his skills to run rings around TKZ and pulverize him. In Round 3, he chased TKZ across the Octagon, hunting for a takedown, only to release when he was expected to pull down and instead cut TKZ open with a punishing right hook.In the final round, TKZ was so confused by Ortega's offense that he found himself getting hit by simple right and left straights. When the final bell rang, it was no surprise that Ortega won by unanimous decision (50-45, 50-45, 50-45). What was surprising was how good Ortega was. It didn't matter that he didn't get a tune-up fight; he didn't need one. He hasn't been gone for 22 months, he's been preparing for 22 months, and now he's better than ever.One thing UFC president Dana White is particularly proud of is ensuring nobody in his organization gets a "tune-up" fight.

Sichuan rookie Zhu Songwei went 1-7 from the field to finish with five points in 20 minutes.After another newbie, Zheng Qilong of the Jiangsu Dragons, scored 20 points in Saturday's season opener, many expected Zhu to have a similar performance. Zhu, 23, averaged 19.6 points and 7.6 rebounds in the Chinese University Basketball Association and had been nicknamed the "Kevin Durant of Shantou University."However, the CBA is a different world. Hu missed six shots, over half of which were wide open. He also committed four fouls and when he was on the court, Sichuan was the losing side. One game could never define Zhu's career but it's a reminder he needs to work harder to adapt to the league.Shenzhen established a safe lead from the beginning with a 15-2 run. Sichuan managed to slim the deficit to single digits more than once but their defense lacked consistency. After the first quarter, Shenzhen finished every quarter leading by 10+ points before taking the win.Dai Huaibo leads Jilin over NanjingThe Jilin Northeast Tigers beat the Nanjing Monkey Kings 105-97 on Sunday. Though Jilin's Jiang Yuxing fouled out early in the fourth quarter, Dai Huaibo carried the team on his shoulders by dropping a game-high 27 points. Dai's constant attack on Nanjing's paint helped Jilin lead 29-10 in free throw attempts.Having missed the playoffs last season, Nanjing went through great changes during the offseason. They hired a new general manager, Huo Nan, appointed a new head coach, Zvjezdan Misimovic, and landed 13 new players.Nanjing saw five of their players reach double-digit points but the team also turned the ball over 21 times, giving Jilin too many opportunities for easy points via fast break. Meanwhile, the 31 fouls they committed also meant Nanjing's players need to get more familiar with each other defensively.Beijing pockets win for Bayi's absenceThe Bayi Rockets, who were scheduled to play the Beijing Ducks on Sunday, did not show up in the arena. Therefore, Beijing was awarded a 20-0 win. There's no official announcement whether Bayi will continue to miss the rest of their games this season.Wang Zhelin is outnumbered by ShanxiThe Shanxi Loongs defeated the Fujian Sturgeons 99-92. Though Fujian's ace center Wang Zhelin put down 32 points and 18 rebounds, both game highs, he could not carry his team to victory alone.Despite Wang's incredible performance, Fujian only saw three of their players reach double-digit points â Huang Yichao (13) and Xu Mingzhi (11). The team's other ace, Chen Linjian, was 1-6 in FGs to score only two points.By contrast, six of Shanxi's players reached double-digits in scoring. Zhou Zhandong had 12 points, four rebounds, nine assists and three steals. His orchestrating added great mobility to Shanxi's offense which Fujian found difficult to contain.In the last two games on Sunday night, the Zhejiang Lions pocketed a big win over the Shanghai Sharks. The Lions' star pair Sun Minghui and Hu Jinqiu together put down 72 points, 13 rebounds, and nine assists.

The 23-year-old from Brooklyn became the unified lightweight champion and managed to do what few in boxing thought he could do â outbox perhaps the best technician in boxing.Lopez (16-0) added the three titles held by Lomachenko (15-2) to the belt he won last year to become the undisputed 135-champion.Lopez was favored 119-109, 117-111 and 116-112 on ringside scorecards in a bout held without fans at the MGM Grand conference center. The Associated Press had Lopez winning 117-111.Lopez proved faster and stronger than the 32-year-old Lomachenko, who won two Olympic gold medals as an amateur and was regarded as one of the top pound-for-pound fighters as a pro. Surprisingly enough, he was also the better boxer and proved he could close the show by bloodying Lomachenko's eye in the 12th round."I had to dig deep, man," Lopez said. "I'm a fighter, I've got to dig in deep."Lomachenko, ordinarily a slow starter, was too slow this time as he gave away rounds early as he tried to figure out the style of Lopez. By the time the fight got competitive in the eighth round he was too far behind to come back."He's been in a 14-month layoff," Lopez said. "I knew it was going to take him a long time to catch up."Lomachenko, who lost only once in nearly 400 amateur fights and had only one loss as a pro, thought he did better than the scorecards indicated."Definitely I am not agreeing with the scorecards," he said.The fight was the biggest since the pandemic began and would have been a pay-per-view event in normal times. But with no fans it was televised on ESPN, providing boxing with a bigger showcase than it would have gotten otherwise.Lomachenko was a 4-1 favorite but looked rusty early as he tried to solve the style of Lopez. He threw punches only sparingly the first half of the fight, landing just 31 punches in the first seven rounds, before finally picking up the pace in the eighth round."I think the first half of the fight he got more rounds than I did but in the second half of the fight I took over," Lomachenko said. "I was much better."Punch statistics showed Lopez landed 183 of 659 punches while Lomachenko was credited with 141 of 321. In the 12th round Lopez outlanded Lomachenko 50 to 19 and opened up a cut that sent blood flowing down his face and prompted referee Russell Mora to stop the fight with 10 seconds left to have the ring doctor look at it before resuming.Lopez was told by his father in the corner before the 12th round that he was ahead and not to risk anything. But he came out strong and beat Lomachenko to the punch."I didn't know if they had him up on the scorecards or not," Lopez said.Lopez did his trademark backflip in the ring after the unanimous decision was announced.Lopez became the youngest fighter to become a four-belt champion in only his second title fight. He had sought the fight against Lomachenko, angering the Ukrainian with his brash tactics."I love to fight and I can bang too," Lopez said.

agencies)China's women's national volleyball team captain and superstar spiker Zhu Ting will continue representing Tianjin Bohai Bank for the Chinese Volleyball Super League (CVL)'s new season as she showed up wearing her regular No. 5 jersey with the team at a pre-season charity match in Tianjin on Saturday.Having spearheaded the team for their 12th CVL title without conceding a single match last season, Zhu had listed Tianjin as her top choice for the upcoming new season, which is scheduled to take off in a tournament format in Jiangmen, southeast China's Guangdong Province on November

I look forward to my future cooperation with the team," said Zhu, who won her first domestic league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) with Tianjin last year.Before joining Tianjin last season, the 25-year-old Chinese spiker had an incredible ride at the Turkish women's volleyball club Vakifbank Istanbul for three seasons, sweeping a haul of trophies, including the esteemed FIVB Club World Championships and CEV Champions League. She pressed the pause button for her overseas journey last year, joining Tianjin Bohai Bank and playing at China's domestic volleyball league all for one goal in mind â 2020 Tokyo Olympics.That goal also plays a crucial factor in her choice to stay with the Tianjin team. The coaching staff Zhu works with at the Tianjin Bohai Bank, many of them are part of the national team's coaching squad. And some of Zhu's teammates at Team Tianjin, such as Yao Di and Li Yingying, are also national team players who will fight with Zhu in Tokyo.Lang Ping, the head coach of China's women's national volleyball team, has been considerate in giving advice upon Zhu's joining of Tianjin."Coach Lang told me to follow the team's instructions and finish training and all kinds of tasks as planned by the team. At the same time, I should go and communicate whenever I have sustained an injury," said Zhu."She also encouraged me to reach a level of communications with the team where we are familiar with each other's needs."Due to her right wrist's injury, Zhu has taken an eight-week-long break and thus missed out on the Chinese Women's Volleyball Championships which concluded earlier this month. Working on getting back on court, Zhu is optimistic about her recovery and has tremendous trust on the club's physiotherapist Daniel Wai Hong, who is also the therapist with the national team."I will gradually get back my form through each game and work with Daniel to make plans. He can really help me achieve many impossible tasks, and I think I will be fine," said Zhu.Tianjin Bohai Bank claimed league championship last season, and with Zhu, it is on course to their 13th league title. However, Zhu has set her vision beyond securing another domestic crown."Everything is for the Olympics, no matter it is the game or the training," said Zhu. "We need to work on our weaknesses through this domestic league competition as well as the training session leading up to the Olympics."(Cover image: Zhu Ting stand with teammates during a preseason charity volleyball game of the 2020-2021 Chinese Volleyball Super League in Tianjin, China, October 17, 2020. /VCG)China's women's national volleyball team captain and superstar spiker Zhu Ting will continue representing Tianjin Bohai Bank for the Chinese Volleyball Super League (CVL)'s new season as she showed up wearing her regular No. 5 jersey with the team at a pre-season charity match in Tianjin on Saturday.Having spearheaded the team for their 12th CVL title without conceding a single match last season, Zhu had listed Tianjin as her top choice for the upcoming new season, which is scheduled to take off in a tournament format in Jiangmen, southeast China's Guangdong Province on November 12. "Thanks to our last season's cooperation, I've developed really good relationships with my teammates as well as the club.

Everything I did was authorized."He is currently quarantined at his home in Turin after travelling from Portugal in an air ambulance. "I am continuing my quarantine, I am alone, my family is on another floor, we can't be in contact and it will be like that at least for the next 10 days," the 35-year-old added. Local health authorities in the Piedmont region said that prosecutors had been informed of the departure of Ronaldo and other Juve players to join their respective national teams while the Italian champions were in isolation following two COVID-19 cases among the team's non-playing staff. Juventus said on Thursday that Ronaldo, who claims to not have the "slightest symptom", returned to Italy in a "medical flight authorized by the competent health authorities". The entire Juve team were back in isolation on Wednesday evening after U.S. midfielder Weston McKennie tested positive. Both McKennie and Ronaldo are in quarantine and must test negative before rejoining their teammates. Under UEFA rules a player must provide evidence that he is no longer sick a week before a European match. Ronaldo, who will miss Juve's Serie A match with Crotone and their Champions League opener against Dynamo Kiev on October 20, must test negative on October 21 to play against Barcelona and old foe Lionel Messi a week later. (With input from agencies)Cristiano Ronaldo shot back at Italy's sports minister on Friday by denying that he broke the coronavirus protocol adopted for the country's football after returning from international duty while positive for the disease. On Thursday Minister of Sport Vincenzo Spadafora said that Portugal captain Ronaldo had broken protocol after he left isolation with his club Juventus to join up with his national team and then returned to Italy following his positive test. "I never broke the protocol," Ronaldo said during an interview on Instagram, "I followed all the protocols and I will continue to follow them, my conscience is clear ...

"In the next couple of years, I'm sure we'll get the best out of him."Meanwhile, United skipper Harry Maguire is keen to play on and overcome his poor recent displays for club and country but could miss the Newcastle game with a knock, Solskjaer added.Maguire endured a torrid time in United's 6-1 thrashing by Tottenham Hotspur before the international break and sustained an injury before being sent off in England's 1-0 Nations League defeat by Denmark on Wednesday.But Solskjaer backed the 27-year-old, who also featured in England's 2-1 win over Belgium, to give his critics a fitting response if he is fit enough to play this weekend."When Harry is part of the England team that beats number one-ranked Belgium it's a normal day. Then you get the headlines when you get a sending off, that's football. You have to deal with it," Solskjaer told reporters."Harry has got great resilience. He knows he will bounce back. He wants to play and work his way out of the last couple of games he's been criticized for."But he picked up a knock just before he came off the other night so we'll have a look at him today."United's defeat by Spurs left them in 16th place with three points from as many matches and Solskjaer said his players were ready to turn their fortunes around."We know we've started the season badly and that game ended really badly... we know we have to perform better but we've now had two weeks to think about it, work on it," Solskjaer said.Manchester United have triggered a one-year option on Paul Pogba's contract, extending the France midfielder's deal until June 2022, British media reported on Friday.The 27-year-old returned to United from Juventus in a then world-record deal worth 89 million pounds (114.93 million U.S. dollars) in 2016 but Pogba has suffered with inconsistent form and injuries at Old Trafford amidst constant speculation over his future.The reports said United's decision to extend his contract was taken before Pogba said on international duty with France that he would love to play for Real Madrid one day.United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer brushed off those comments from the Frenchman, who would have been out of contract next June, during his news conference on the eve of Saturday's Premier League clash at Newcastle United."Paul's our player, he's going to be here for another two years and sure he's focused on doing his best for us and we want to see the best for Paul," Solskjaer said.

Races have been held with teams operating in isolated bubbles and with regular testing.The total number of races was cut to 17 from the record 22 originally envisaged and the first eight races of the season were held without spectators. Portugal will be round 12.Portugal, a nation of just over 10 million people, initially won praise for its quick response to the pandemic, recording a comparatively low 95,902 confirmed coronavirus cases and 2,149 deaths, but cases have crept up lately.On Friday, the country hit 2,608 daily cases, the highest number of infections in a single day since the pandemic started, according to its health authority, although testing rates have also increased.Also on Friday, the organizer of Vietnam's first F1 Grand pPrix said it has canceled the race, having already postponed the event initially scheduled for April due to the COVID-19 pandemic.F1 races schedulesOctober 31- November 1, Emilia Romagna Grand Prix at the Enzo e Dino Ferrari race track in Italy (no in-person attendance)November 13-15, Turkish Grand Prix at Istanbul Park circuit in Turkey (limited in-person attendance)November 27-29, Bahrain Grand Prix at Bahrain circuit (limited in-person attendance)December 4-6, Sakhir Grand Prix at Bahrain circuit (limited in-person attendance)December 11-13, Abu Dhabi Grand Prix at Yas Marina Circuit in UAE (limited in-person attendance)(With input from agencies)Portugal's health authority said on Friday it was reconsidering whether to allow fans into sports events, including next week's F1 Grand Prix for which thousands of tickets had been sold, as it is trying to contain a surge in COVID-19 infections.Without providing further details, the head of the health authority, Graca Freitas, told a news conference another option under consideration was to reduce the number of spectators.The director of the 90,000 capacity Portimao circuit, in the country's southern Algarve region, said in August around 28,000 tickets had already been sold but warned fans would not be allowed in if the pandemic worsened.F1 announced in July the Portimao circuit would host a grand prix for the first time as part of a revised calendar after some other races were cancelled as a result of the pandemic.The October 24-25 race is also due to mark the return of the exclusive Paddock Club hospitality for VIP guests for the first time this season.Freitas said the decision will take into consideration the epidemiological situation in the region where the event is happening and the type of event in question.There was no immediate comment from F1 as only "limited in-person attendance" message posted on its website.The Portuguese race was scheduled to mark the gradual return of fans to F1 races and five figure attendance is anticipated for upcoming races in Imola and Istanbul in November.According to F1 health protocols, all spectators must wear masks, have their temperature tested, and stick to their designated seat.After F1 held its first eight races behind closed doors, the first race to allow fans to attend in limited numbers was the Tuscan Grand Prix at Mugello in Italy on September 13.The Ferrari-owned track allowed 2,880 paying fans to attend each day.F1 welcomed spectators in greater numbers so far in a COVID-19 hit season at the Russian Grand Prix between September 25 and 27, attracting a 30,000 strong crowd in attendance.The start of the F1 season was pushed back to July from March due to the pandemic.

shrugged off any lingering fatigue to score twice in his second game in 48 hours as Paris Saint-Germain defeated 10-man Nimes 4-0 on Friday to take over top spot in Ligue 1.The France forward struck the opener on 32 minutes at the Stade des Costieres and netted again late on as a weary Nimes folded following the early dismissal of center-back Loick Landre.Alessandro Florenzi scored PSG's second on 77 minutes and Pablo Sarabia notched a fourth for the reigning champions as PSG climbed above Rennes on goal difference after a fifth successive win."I spoke with Kylian yesterday, he told me that he felt good and that he absolutely wanted to play," said PSG coach Thomas Tuchel."He's the guy who can always make a difference and he did just that."New signings Moise Kean and Rafinha made their PSG debuts with a host of players missing following the international break and just four days ahead of the visit of Manchester United in the Champions League.Ander Herrera, cleared to return after a positive Covid-19 test, drew the first in a series of superb saves from Nimes goalkeeper Baptiste Reynet having replaced the injured Paredes.But Mbappe gave PSG the lead after he was played through by Rafinha, rounding the advancing Reynet before slotting in his third league goal of the campaign.  Everton loanee Kean should have added a second but was denied by an alert Reynet, with Idrissa Gueye and Florenzi also testing the Nimes keeper.Florenzi rattled the post twice in the second half, with a volley and header, but the Italy defender eventually gave PSG room to breathe as he nodded in Sarabia's header back across goal.Mbappe promptly grabbed his second of the night with another nerveless finish after Sarabia shredded a tiring Nimes defence.The Spaniard then caught out the hosts from a quickly-taken free-kick to smack in a fourth through the legs of Reynet two minutes from the end. Earlier, Rennes extended their unbeaten start to the Ligue 1 season despite drawing 1-1 at bottom side Dijon.Lille or Lens could overtake PSG and Rennes with victory in Sunday's Derby du Nord, the first such fixture in over five years.(With input from AFP)Kylian Mbappe shrugged off any

China's two young female skates Lin Shan and Zhu Yi are expected to participate at Skate America as they are currently training overseas.(Cover image: Sui Wenjing and Han Cong of China perform at the Gala Exhibition during day three of the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating Cup of China at Huaxi Sports Center in Chongqing, China, November 10, 2019. /VCG)TOP HEADLINES- France has reported a record 30,621 new daily cases, bringing the country's cumulative total to 809,684. - Germany has warned against non-essential travel to France, the Netherlands, Malta and Slovakia after a spike in infection rates in those countries. - Hundreds of Catalonia's hospitality workers gathered in Barcelona on Friday to protest against the 15-day lockdown of all bars and restaurants in the region.- France is to introduce rapid tests at airports by the end of October in a bid to revive air traffic in the country, its transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari said. - A Berlin court has suspended a curfew on the city's bars and restaurants because it considers it "disproportionate in view of other measures taken to fight the pandemic."- Belgium's foreign minister and deputy premier, Sophie Wilmes, has announced she will self-isolate after experiencing virus symptoms. - The UK's Wimbledon tennis championships has admitted it is planning for next year's tournament to potentially be held without spectators amid the pandemic. - "The situation in Switzerland is deteriorating faster than elsewhere," according to the country's health minister Alain Berset.- Schools in Italy's southern region of Campania have decided to close less than a month after reopening amid a surge of new cases in the area. - France Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has pledged $1.17 billion to help companies cope with the impact of the nation's new curfew in nine cities across the country, including Paris. - UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson has said he may have to intervene to save lives in Manchester if local leaders continue to disagree to a move to the highest virus alert level. - England is getting "very close" to the figures reported at the peak of the virus in April, according to Graham Medley, a government health adviser. - Finland's Prime Minister Sanna Marin has left the European Council after discovering she had come into contact with someone who has tested positive.   ACROSS EUROPEToni Waterman in BrusselsBelgiumBelgium had a record-breaking 10,448 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours as the country struggles to get the upper hand on the virus's spread.

Nicklaus, Greg Norman and Rory McIlroy, will not tee off."It's unprecedented and a real blow for Australian golf and its fans," said PGA of Australia chief executive Gavin Kirkman after what he called "months of exhaustive consultations."Australia has closed its international borders to most travelers as part of its effort to suppress the coronavirus pandemic, and even people moving between some of the country's different states and regions can be subject to a mandatory two-week quarantine.PGA officials considered a raft of options to deal with the restrictions, including players entering a hub and competing while serving a strict quarantine period, as well as restricting crowd numbers and movement.

In an interview with Xinhua News Agency on Tuesday, Li talked about his experience of coaching the national team, his expectations on the new CBA career and views over youth development.Li was appointed as team consultant of Jiangsu in May. Three months later, he became the new head coach of the team. Having finished the last season with a disappointing 17-29 record, Jiangsu are not only young â with an average age only 22 years old â but also little-known. Therefore, Li's job can be very challenging."It does give me a feeling of starting over coming to Jiangsu," said Li. "I was first player and then coach during my 23-, 24-year-long domestic career, but I did not have much experience of coaching top-level games or competitions close to top level. That's why I think it's time for me to start over at a club to collect more experience.""Our team has a lot of young men and only one or two 'older ones.' That means some of the young guys will appear in the starting lineup. Some of them will stay longer than others on the court. Maybe some of the boys are not ready yet, but that's where we are right now."Young blood never lacks passion or fighting spirit, but these are just uncut diamonds who still need time to refine their skills."We need rules both in practice and in the game. I want them to act on their own as long as they follow my forms. I don't want to make excessive demand on everything they do.â"Today's kids lack practice. â¦ I want to increase their practice time to make up for it. Second, I want help them learn how to fear no hardships and how not to give up in front of setbacks. These can all be done via daily training and management."It will take longer for people to forget China's failure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup at home in 2019. As the team's head coach, Li was questioned the most over his choice of rotation and timeouts."I think every coach has his own style and habit for calling timeout and deciding rotation. For example, I did not make that substitution at that moment but I couldn't say 'I should have done that' after the game. â¦ You can't do everything as others expect. They question you because they pay more attention to the result."Having coached the national team for over two years, Li generalized China's problems into two: lack of tough-battle experience and inferior individual ability."We played too little with European teams or stronger American teams, like only very few games a year. It's not the same as playing warm-up games at home. We need to go overseas and attend more competitions like the NBA Summer League or the contests in Europe. Ideally, you train for three or four weeks and then play three or four games. Then you start training again and do the same repeatedly. But our team cannot do this because of many difficulties.""When we say a player 'carries his own system,' like LeBron James, it means wherever he goes, the team plays in his way. Our national team does not have guys like that. We have no Sonny Weems or Jeremy Lin. We always say we play as a team, but how? What is our style? Our players' ability defines team's style. For China, I think passing is still our problem. So is penetrating. We used to call guys who can slash with absolute speed 'sharp blade.' Now we don't have enough of those players."Then what can Chinese players do to solve this problem? Li believes the key lies in making players ask more of themselves. "Chinese players, especially the young ones, are too easily satisfied and lack sense of competition. Without sense of competition, they can't find motivation. They are too comfortable in the clubs. They fall short of the best but are better than the worst. That can't be good for players. That's why I kept telling my guys: you need to want to get better before we can help you.

The fact that they won it in misfortune year only made the title even more special.While everyone was happy, the Lakers' front office may need to leave the parties behind, sit back in front of the desk and figure out how to deal with their current lineup.Anthony DavisThough he was not the Finals MVP, the fact is, the arrival of Davis brought the purple and gold Larry O'Brien Trophy this season. He still has one year (about $28.8 million) left of his current contract and he can choose to opt out of it. If he does, Davis will become an unrestricted free agent and can sign a new five-year deal worth $189.9 million with the Lakers.Hold on that thought because there are other ways to further maximize Davis' earnings. First, he can sign a 1+1 contract and opt out again in 2021 summer to sign a new extension. However, considering that the salary cap may not grow much next year, the increase of Davis' income will still be limited.ESPN's expert Bobby Marks suggested that Davis sign a 2+1 contract with the Lakers and opt out of it in 2022 summer. There will be several benefits via doing so. First, Davis will be qualified for Designated Veteran Player Extension, which is also known as a supermax deal. If the NBA revenues return to normal in 2022, Davis can sign a five-year contract worth $243.6 million with the team.LeBron JamesJames received the fourth Finals MVP of his for good reasons. He led in average points (29.8), rebounds (11.8), true shooting percentage (67.1) and effective field goal percentage (65.7) of the two teams' major rotations during the series. James still has two years ($39.2 million and $41 million) left of his current deal with the Lakers.The purple and gold have the right to extend James contract this summer by another two years, paying him $43 million and $46.5 million in the last two years. Despite his incredible performance this season, James is turning 36 years old in December. Leading the team to win the 17th title definitely deserves reward. The Lakers will need to decide how much the reward should be.Others with player optionThe following four guys have player option during the off-season: Rajon Rondo, Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, JaVale McGee and Avery Bradley.Averaging 8.7 points, 5.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists and 1.0 steals during the Finals did not tell how important Rondo was to the Lakers. He is the team's second orchestrator, bond of perimeter defense and ball distributor in half-court offense.According to Chris Sheridan of BasketballNews.com, Rondo will understandably opt out of the $2.7-million deal of his to become an unrestricted player. Judging by his performance in the playoffs and his old age (34 year), it should not be hard for Rondo to get a two-year, $16-million deal.Pope averaged 12.8 points, the third-highest of the Lakers during the Finals. His defense of Duncan Robinson was very impressive. Though his 30.3-percent 3-point rate was not pretty but Pope took 43 triple attempts, the most of the team and made 13 of them, the second most of the purple and gold. He fit well playing along James.Pope's contract will pay him $8.5 million next year. If he opts out of it, he may receive a similar number of average annual salary.Neither McGee nor Bradley got much chance in the bubble in Orlando. If McGee opts out of his contract, he should still be able to find a new job thanks to his size, athleticism and finishing ability. Bradley, by contrast, may not be that lucky.The Lakers won't have much cap space even if they let all of the four go.

Ajan had been at the IWF for 44 years as general secretary and president. Richard McLaren, the Canadian law professor whose findings in July 2016 led to Russia being banned from all international athletic competitions, including the Rio Olympics, told reporters in June that the IWF was rife with corruption. This included vote buying, doping cover-ups and $10.4 million in cash that cannot be accounted for.

That will put the 2024 event on February 13, bringing it into conflict with New Orleans' Mardi Gras event; hence the league's decision.According to CNBC, the NFL will decide next year over the location for 2024 Super Bowl.

New Orleans, which was supposed to host Super Bowl LVIII in 2024, will have to wait one more year to witness Super Bowl take place at the New Orleans Saints' Mercedes-Benz Superdome for the eighth time.As the NFL will extend the regular season to 17 games from next year, Super Bowl will be one week later than usual as well. That will put the 2024 event on February 13, bringing it into conflict with New Orleans' Mardi Gras event; hence the league's decision.According to CNBC, the NFL will decide next year over the location for 2024 Super Bowl. "We anticipate interest from Las Vegas and other cities around the country to host America's most popular even," said an NFL spokesperson.By the way Super Bowl will take place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and State Farm Stadium in Arizona in 2021, 2022 and 2023 respectively.Harry Maguire's miserable start to the season continued with a red card as England had two men sent off for the first time in their Nations League defeat by Denmark, while Kylian Mbappe gave World Cup holders France a 2-1 victory in Croatia and Portugal won without Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday.Christian Eriksen's penalty on his 100th appearance for Denmark earned his side a 1-0 win over England in their Nations League clash at Wembley.Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eriksen powered his spot-kick past Jordan Pickford in the 35th minute, a couple of minutes after England center-back Harry Maguire had received a red card for a second booking.The defeat ended a run of nine successive home wins for England, who beat top-ranked Belgium on Sunday, while Denmark, who have lost just two of their last 40 international matches, celebrated their first victory over England at Wembley since 1983.England slipped to third place in Group A2 which is now headed by Belgium with Denmark above England on goal difference."Disappointed to lose the match but extremely proud of how we responded to going down to 10 men," said England manager Gareth Southgate, who rather surprisingly opted not to send on Aston Villa's creative midfielder Jack Grealish when chasing the game."We had a few chances that on another day would have gone in. The 10 men changes the game and they get a soft penalty."While it was a memorable night for Danish playmaker Eriksen, it was a disappointing one for England who suffered only their second home defeat in 32 competitive internationals.Mbappe strike gives France 2-1 win in CroatiaFrance stretched their unbeaten run against Croatia to eight games after a late goal by Kylian Mbappe gave the World Cup holders a 2-1 win in their Nations League top-tier Group 3 match on Wednesday.The result left France second in the group on 10 points from four games, behind Portugal on goal difference after the European champions brushed aside Sweden 3-0. Croatia have three points and the Swedes none.France beat Croatia 4-2 in the 2018 World Cup final before defeating them by the same score in last month's reverse Nations League fixture."We knew we'd be in a real battle," France coach Didier Deschamps told French TF1 television."We started very well and it's a pity we didn't go two goals clear as Kylian had a big chance. We did what we needed to do in the second half."It's not because we won a trophy in 2018 that you win by clicking your fingers. You have to look at the way the opponents play too."Croatia defender Dejan Lovren rued his team's concentration lapses."France are ruthlessly efficient and they will punish you every time you switch off, even for a split second," he told reporters."Playing against them is very frustrating because you can be as entertaining as you like but to no avail. The three points is all that matters."Portugal brush off Ronaldo absence to outclass SwedenGoals from Bernardo Silva and a brace from Diogo Jota gave Portugal a comfortable 3-0 win over Sweden in the Nations League on Wednesday as the hosts made light of the absence of Cristiano Ronaldo due to a positive COVID-19 test.With 10 points from four games, Portugal top Group 2 in League A on goal difference ahead of France, who beat Croatia 2-1 in Zagreb. The Swedes are bottom of the group after slumping to four straight defeats."We were not asked to play any differently [without Ronaldo], our ambition remains the same," Manchester United's Portuguese midfielder Bruno Fernandes told reporters."The team has great values but it is obvious that it is easier to win with the best in the world."(With input from agencies)Harry Maguire's miserable start to the season continued with a red card as England had two men sent off for the first time in their Nations League defeat by Denmark, while Kylian Mbappe gave World Cup holders France a 2-1 victory in Croatia and Portugal won without Cristiano Ronaldo on Wednesday.Christian Eriksen's penalty on his 100th appearance for Denmark earned his side a 1-0 win over England in their Nations League clash at Wembley.Former Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Eriksen powered his spot-kick past Jordan Pickford in the 35th minute, a couple of minutes after England center-back Harry Maguire had received a red card for a second booking.The defeat ended a run of nine successive home wins for England, who beat top-ranked Belgium on Sunday, while Denmark, who have lost just two of their last 40 international matches, celebrated their first victory over England at Wembley since 1983.England slipped to third place in Group A2 which is now headed by Belgium with Denmark above England on goal difference."Disappointed to lose the match but extremely proud of how we responded to going down to 10 men," said England manager Gareth Southgate, who rather surprisingly opted not to send on Aston Villa's creative midfielder Jack Grealish when chasing the game."We had a few chances that on another day would have gone in.

The 28-year-old denied the wrongdoing and stressed his innocence. "I feel I am already seen as a sinner of doping, but I am not," Wanjiru said when he heard of his provisional suspension. "I am innocent."According to the AIU's disciplinary report on Wanjiru, the international athlete accepted a "volunteer provisional suspension" in December 2019, agreeing not to race until the final outcome of the case was delivered. Because of this, the four-year ban has been backdated to the day of his original suspension on December 9 last year, which means he won't be allowed to compete again until December 2023. Wanjiru rose to fame after beating Kenenisa Bekele to the 2017 London Marathon title. He was also the winner at the Amsterdam Marathon in 2016, where he set his marathon PB at 2:05:21.In addition to his ban, all results Wanjiru recorded from March 9, 2019, the date when the test was taken, will be disqualified including forfeiture of any medals, titles, ranking points and prize and appearance money.Kenyan long-distance runner Daniel Wanjiru was banned for four years by the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) on Wednesday following an Athlete Biological Passport (ABP) violation. He was provisionally suspended in April for "use of a prohibited substance/method" after "abnormalities" were found in his biological passport.

In two weeks, the government will evaluate the situation to see whether the rules should be loosened or tightened.In he past seven days, 43,903 people tested positive for COVID-19, an increase of almost 60 percent compared with the week before, while 150 people died, compared with 89 the week before.Iolo ap Dafydd in London Millions of people in the north of England from today are living under stricter conditions as a second wave of the coronavirus pandemic grips the UK.The government's new three-tier system has been implemented, with in Liverpool city and the surrounding region placed on the highest third tier, which could last for three weeks. It's not a total lockdown, as schools, universities and retail shops stay open. Pubs and bars not selling food have to close, so do other businesses where social distancing is difficult.  For now, the rest of the country is in tier one and two, but areas such as Greater Manchester, the North East, south Yorkshire and parts of the Midlands could follow if infections keeps increasing.The Labour mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said it was "disappointing" how the Conservative government is "piling the pressure" on his region "without negotiating."The political clash between the UK's right-wing government and center-left opposition parties, including the devolved governments in Wales and Scotland, is deepening. The main opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer has called for a two- to three-week national lockdown in England, to try to break the viral cycle. Mark Drakeford, Wales's Labour first minister has repeatedly called for those living in high COVID-19 areas of England not to visit Wales, where local lockdowns are in place.The UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson hasnât endorsed that and argues the English system is a "moderate" and "balanced" approach to saving lives and protecting the economy at the same time.Mia Alberti in FrankfurtGermany reached yet another record of daily coronavirus cases since April, having registered 5,132 new infections on Wednesday. The total number of positive tests is now 334,585, according to the Robert Koch Institute. There were also 40 more deaths, a substantial increase compared with previous days. The death toll now stands at 9,677.This comes as Chancellor Angela Merkel is set to meet with German state leaders to discuss further restrictions. The meeting will be held in person for the first time since the beginning of the pandemic, showing the urgency felt by the chancellor to curb the exponential increase in cases of the past few weeks.   FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: Chinese mainland reports 20 new COVID-19 casesCGTN America: New York Philharmonic cancels 2020/21 season CGTN Africa: Uganda authorities caution parents against issuing sanitizers to learnersSign up here to get the COVID-19 Europe bulletin sent directly to your inboxCGTN Europe has been providing in-depth coverage of the novel coronavirus story as it has unfolded. Here you can read the essential information about the crisis.Miu Hirano, who won women's singles title for Japan at the Table Tennis World Cup in 2016, decided to quit the upcoming ITTF World Tour Grand Finals because of lower back pain, announced her management company on Tuesday.

Kato's teammates included Mima Ito, Kasumi Ishikawa and Hitomi Sato. Kato participated in the World Table Tennis Championships last year. She started to draw more attention after defeating Ito and China's Chen Meng at ITTF's T2 Diamond League this July.Ito, who currently ranks second in the world, has confirmed she will attend the Finals. Having missed formal matches for eight months, the Japanese ace was eager to find out what she can do now.World's top 16 ranking players were invited to this year's finals but each federation can send no more than four players to men's and women's competitions. China's Fan Zhendong, Xu Xin, Ma Long and Lin Gaoyuan were qualified for men's matches while Chen Meng, Sun Yingsha, Wang Manyu and Liu Shiwen were qualified for women's.

According to Hollinger, the league will give teams eight-week-notice ahead of the start of the season, which will be November 23.Postponing the beginning of the season was just the first step and more will follow. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is still far from under control in the U.S., should the league continue to put all games in a bubble? It's true that it worked behind closed doors in Orlando but let's face it: only 20 teams entered the bubble for eight regular season games and 16 of them attended the playoffs. What will happen if all 30 teams have to finish an 82-game regular season in a bubble (or multiple ones)?The trouble is not over. The NBA wants to bring fans back to the games as much as fans want to do the same. If the new season will take place in a bubble, the league will have to get creative in figuring out how to allow fans in while ensuring the bubble's safety.The MLB may offer the NBA an example to follow as the baseball league put several straight games in one place to slim down teams' time on the road and speed up the season. The NBA must watch out for two things if it wants to introduce that mechanism: first, read carefully the traveling restrictions of the Canadian government for the sake of the Toronto Raptors; second, determine the length of the season (the MLB cut it from 162 games to 60).There's also the problem with the Tokyo Olympics, which has already been postponed to July 2021. Basically, it's impossible for the NBA to finish the whole season before that and even if it somehow does it, one can't expect the best players to join the national team for Tokyo right after an exhausting competition. Either way, it seems unlikely for Team USA to get vengeance for their painful failure at the FIBA Basketball World Cup in China in 2019 this time.The 2020 NBA Draft, like the beginning of the new season, was also postponed (to November 18). After that, the free agency market will open, followed by the training camps and then the 2020-21 season.The new NBA season, which should be the 2020-21 campaign, may only happen in 2021 â John Hollinger of The Athletic reported that the new season will begin on January 18, 2021.That means the NBA will return on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and there won't be Christmas Day games.

A game postponed and rescheduled with a second pushed back. Only one practice with two walk-throughs and unrelenting criticism.The Titans remain depleted. They're also still undefeated.Ryan Tannehill threw for three touchdowns and ran for another as the Titans routed the Buffalo Bills 42-16 on a rare Tuesday night in a showdown between two of the NFL's five remaining undefeated teams pushed back two days after a couple more positive tests for Tennessee last week."What this organization has been through over the past couple weeks to really fight through all of that, shake it all off, really limited practice, limited reps and go out and put this kind of win together, I think makes a statement and I'm happy we were able to do that today," Tannehill said.The Titans (4-0) continued their best start since winning their first 10 games in 2008 despite not playing their last game September 27 in Minnesota. Coach Mike Vrabel said everyone in the organization would get a game ball after this performance."I learned a long time ago that the definition of a pro is they make the hard look easy, so whatever situation we're presented with we got to all come together and make the best decisions for the team each and every time," Vrabel said.Malcolm Butler intercepted two passes, the second he returned 68 yards, and both set up short touchdowns for Tennessee. Kareem Orr's recovery of a fumbled kickoff set up Tannehill's fourth TD for 21 points off Buffalo's three turnovers. Kalif Raymond's 40-yard punt return also set up a 1-yard TD run by Derrick Henry."We expected to win," Butler said.The Bills (4-1) had not won five straight games since 2004, and they came in looking for the franchise's best start since 1991 when Buffalo reached the Super Bowl. They also played without starting cornerbacks with Tre'Davious White inactive because of a back injury and Levi Wallace on injured reserve.Starting wide receiver John Brown also was out for Buffalo, which had scored at least 30 points in the past three games."They were ready to go and at the same time we beat ourselves," Bills coach Sean McDermott said.Buffalo center Mitch Morse called this a gut-punch."It's tough, they came out and beat us like a drum," Morse said.Josh Allen came in second in the NFL in yards passing. He threw for 263 yards and two TDs. Stephon Diggs had 10 catches for 106 yards.The Titans needed the turnovers with seven key players on the reserve/COVID-19 list led by wide receivers Corey Davis and Adam Humphries and defensive lineman Jeffery Simmons. They also were missing a couple assistant coaches and two players activated off that reserve list earlier Tuesday were scratched.The Titans got a big boost on the Bills' opening drive.Allen's pass went off Andre Roberts' hands right to Butler, and he returned the interception 29 yards to the Bills 16. Two plays later, Tannehill hit A. J. Brown, who missed the last two games with an injured knee, for a 16-yard TD for the quick lead.The Bills tied it up with a methodical 15-play drive converting four third downs, taking advantage of a Titans' defense playing a pair of rookies in end Larrell Murchison and cornerback Chris Jackson. Allen tossed the ball to Isaiah McKenzie for a 3-yard TD tying it up, the ninth different Bill to catch a TD pass from Allen.The Titans scored 21 of the next 24 points.Tennessee led 21-10 at halftime after Tannehill ran in from 10 yards seconds before the half. Butler refused to go down after picking off an Allen throw to Gabriel Davis late in the third, and Tannehill found Jonnu Smith for a 4-yard TD and a 28-10 lead three plays later.Bills will host Kansas City on Monday night. Safety Micah Hyde denied the Bills got caught looking ahead to the defending Super Bowl champs."No, no, no, no. We were 100 percent focused on the Titans," Hyde said. "We knew this game was going to be played one way or another. It was not looking forward to the Chiefs or anything."Titans will host Texans on Sunday.The Tennessee Titans just put together their most gratifying victory of coach Mike Vrabel's short tenure.They spent the past two weeks dealing with the NFL's first COVID-19 outbreak with each morning bringing news of yet another positive test.

I think the car is obviously outperforming me at the moment because I cannot extract the maximum from the car," he said after completing the maximum 100km allowed."Getting back to the F1 speed is not so easy. I was improving lap after lap and trying to give feedback to the engineers. Also, we had some filming to do, so there were cameras, there were drones following on track."Team boss Cyril Abiteboul said after Sunday's Eifel Grand Prix at Germany's Nuerburgring, where Ricciardo finished third for Renault's first podium since their return as a constructor in 2016, that Alonso was champing to return."We received a message before, during and after the race," said the Frenchman."I think Fernando is like a big shark.

Gavranovic then grabbed his second only for Serge Gnabry to earn Germany a point.The result moves Germany within a point of League A Group Four leaders Spain, who remain on seven points after losing 1-0 away to a Ukraine side now on six points, while the Swiss, still without a win, stay bottom with two points.Germany coach Joachim Loew reverted to a four-man defense for the game in an empty stadium, after they had led in the last four games only to concede equalizers in three of them.But it remained their weak spot on Tuesday as they struggled with quick breaks from the Swiss who found far too much space."It was extremely intense. We started badly but showed great attitude in coming back," Loew said. "That was positive. In defense we made our share of mistakes which we have to stop. But we showed that the team is ready to fight."The Swiss had stunned Germany with Gavranovic's fifth minute header and doubled the lead in the 26th when they intercepted a pass from Toni Kroos, playing in his 100th international, and Freuler beat goalkeeper Manuel Neuer with a cool chip.Werner hit back for the hosts two minutes later, wrong-footing keeper Yann Sommer with a clever low shot, as the Germans maintained possession and kept pushing forward.Robin Gosens' effort was tipped over the bar by Sommer late in the first half but the keeper was beaten when Havertz charged into the box and fired in the equalizer in the 55th.But Germany's backline kept leaking goals as the Swiss went back in front in the 57th. Neuer made consecutive saves from Haris Seferovic but Gavranovic drilled in on the rebound.A sensational Gnabry back heel flick on the hour pulled the home side level once more and rescued a point for Loew's team.Elsewhere, England striker Harry Kane is fit to start Wednesday's Nations League match against Denmark but defenders Ben Chilwell and Kieran Trippier have withdrawn from the squad, manager Gareth Southgate said on Tuesday.Kane did not start Sunday's 2-1 win over Belgium and only came on as a substitute but Southgate said he was "fully fit" even as Tottenham Hotspur urged England to exercise caution over the striker's workload amid a congested schedule.England are top of Nations League Group A2 with seven points after three games, one point ahead of second-placed Belgium.(With input from agencies)Germany twice had to come from behind to earn a rollercoaster 3-3 draw against visitors Switzerland in an exciting Nations League group game packed with incident in Cologne, Germany on Tuesday.The Swiss took an early lead through Mario Gavranovic and Remo Freuler added a second before goals from Timo Werner and Kai Havertz leveled the scores.

Adapted from real events and told through the lens of volleyball legend Lang Ping, it offers a unique glimpse into some of the contentious issues that have compounded her complicated legacy.And therein lies the novelty."'Leap' is distinguished from other patriotic movies in the way that it treats characters in a rather refreshing way while injecting the story with fresh narratives and far-reaching hints," Jing, a movie reviewer who runs his own review website, told CGTN.In recent years, China's entertainment industry has been flooded with movies featuring historical events effusing patriotic sentiments. Making billions in box-office revenues, these movies are beloved by Chinese cinema-goers.While some of these are repetitive, they serve a purpose. "We do need these movies to convey some messages," said Li Jing, another freelance movie reviewer.But "stories need to be told in a way that characters are fully formed," Li explained. "'Leap' is not perfect, but it shows the effort of focusing the narrative on an intricate character."A standard Chinese patriotic movie tends to emphasize individual sacrifices for the collective, but "Leap" did not follow that path, according to Jing. "I believe Peter Ho-sun Chan, the movie director, was more keen on examining the reconciliation between individual fulfillment and collective interests. It transcends the idea that war-time blockbusters are the only type of movies that audiences like."Lang was an indefatigable player in the national women's team when China was just opening up to the outside world in the 1980s. At a time when patriotism was running high and winning sports events on the global stage signified tremendous national pride, Lang and her team secured thrilling victories â including a world championship title and Olympic gold â that still reverberate across the country.After taking up a coaching career in the U.S. and successfully guiding the U.S. national team to notable victories, she returned to China and was determined to lead the struggling Chinese national team back to its peak. But by then, she was no longer just a patriot elated by winning glory for her country, but had become a seasoned, reserved coach accustomed to both victory or defeat.And "Leap" touches on the contentious theme underlying that change: her questioning of China's sports system, where top athletes are required to devote all their energy to their sport but are not prepared for life after their career is over."'Leap' not only acknowledges the fading trend of patriotism in contemporary China, a cause for the loss of spirit that once motivated athletes of older generations, but also hints at Lang's change in attitude towards volleyball as well as the drawbacks of China's sports system," Jing said. "In this respect, Chan approaches these topics with full honesty."Lang suffered permanent injuries due to strenuous training in her early career as an athlete. Even now, she still holds a disability certificate in the U.S.. But before she left China for an overseas coaching career, she was allegedly refused reimbursement for some costly medical bills by the Chinese volleyball association."Chan is very adept at presenting individualism as the product of our time. One of his signature movies in the 1990s, 'Comrades: Almost a Love Story,' depicts a woman who puts her self-interest above others," said Li."In 'Leap,' we can see the unraveling of the same discussion. Though bound to offend some in the audience, this is the sharp reflection of reality," Li added."Leap" follows a number of other bold and thought-provoking films that have come out in recent years.The 2018 movie "The Shadow Play" by Lou Ye took a sharp look at the pervasive practices of forced relocation. "Dying to survive" by Wen Muye, also released in 2018, offers a critical view of China's medical system."Dearest," another one of Chan's works, provocatively dove into the issues surrounding child abduction and did not shun away from the problematic ramifications of China's birth control policies."These movies turned out to be more popular and often received good reviews," noted Jing."Leap" topped the Chinese box office in the first week of its release and has already made 700 million yuan ($104.19 million) since then.Despite speculation that China's censorship system is tightening its grip on the movie industry, a growing number of movie makers have been toeing the line of what is acceptable to the film censors.Lou Ye, director of "The Shadow Play," is known to have challenged the censorship system for years.

Change is never popular, but sometimes change is necessary," observed English Football League (EFL) chairman Ricky Parry, who has long called for "a complete rethink" over the make-up of the country's football. For Parry, the current situation is dire to say the least. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic upended the sports industry, the EFL was full of poorly-managed clubs with a huge financial hole. "The need for a complete rethinking regarding the funding of English professional football predates the COVID-19 crisis," said Parry, who oversees 72 clubs in the three divisions below the Premier League. "The gap between the Premier League and the EFL has become a chasm which has become unbridgeable for clubs transitioning between the EFL and Premier League," he added. This stance is echoed by Nigel Travis, chairman of League Two side Leyton Orient. "Before the pandemic, 75 percent of clubs were losing money - that can't continue. The pandemic has, if you like, exacerbated the problem and we need to get it fixed," he told BBC in a recent interview. "One thing I need to quash is, this isn't about the pandemic, this is about a crisis in football that goes back many years. If clubs don't get something soon you will see clubs disappear, I would predict, within five-six weeks," Travis predicted. Under such circumstances, a radical reform plan, which has been dubbed 'Project Big Picture' was duly unveiled by EFL over the weekend. According to multiple British media outlets, the plan was mainly devised by Liverpool owner, John W Henry, and the Manchester United chairman, Joel Glazer, while Parry, a lifelong Liverpool fan and former Chief Executive of the club, was the driving force behind it. "It's a day to applaud Liverpool and Manchester United," beamed Parry. "Not to be suspicious, not to be critical, but actually just to look at the nuts and bolts of the plan, which really do stand out. Very clear, very simple. It is about a reset. It is about redistribution."Under the proposals, the Premier League will cut from 20 to 18 clubs, with both the League Cup and Community Shield being abolished. Meanwhile, a 250 million pounds ($325 million) rescue fund will be made immediately available to the EFL, who could sell its broadcast rights alongside those of the top flight and would take 25 percent of the future revenue. Most significantly of all, however, the traditional 'big six' of Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur will be given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, which means only six votes will be required to implement significant changes in the future. It inevitably led to accusations of a power grab and triggered a fierce criticism from the UK government. "It's clear that this proposal does not command support throughout the Premier League - it is exactly this type of backroom dealing that undermines trust in football governance," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also condemned what it called a "backroom deal.""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game," a DCMS spokesperson said. The Premier League later weighed in by releasing a statement saying: "In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support." "Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute," it added.While Parry remained unequivocal in his support of the plan, the seeds of division have already been sowed.  "Some Premier League club are very much against the proposal," a West Ham source was quoted as saying by the BBC. "The big six are using COVID for a power grab. If this goes through, over time they will just use more and more for themselves." But another Premier League club source told the Guardian that he was confident about the prospect of the plan, adding: "Beggars can't be choosers. It is about saving the game from oblivion." "Change is never easy.

Meanwhile, a 250 million pounds ($325 million) rescue fund will be made immediately available to the EFL, who could sell its broadcast rights alongside those of the top flight and would take 25 percent of the future revenue. Most significantly of all, however, the traditional 'big six' of Liverpool, United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester City, and Tottenham Hotspur will be given 'special voting rights' on certain issues, which means only six votes will be required to implement significant changes in the future. It inevitably led to accusations of a power grab and triggered a fierce criticism from the UK government. "It's clear that this proposal does not command support throughout the Premier League - it is exactly this type of backroom dealing that undermines trust in football governance," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Monday.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) also condemned what it called a "backroom deal.""We are surprised and disappointed that at a time of crisis when we have urged the top tiers of professional football to come together and finalise a deal to help lower league clubs, there appear to be backroom deals being cooked up that would create a closed shop at the very top of the game," a DCMS spokesperson said. The Premier League later weighed in by releasing a statement saying: "In the Premier League's view, a number of the individual proposals in the plan could have a damaging impact on the whole game and we are disappointed to see that Rick Parry, chair of the EFL, has given his on-the-record support." "Football has many stakeholders, therefore this work should be carried out through the proper channels enabling all clubs and stakeholders the opportunity to contribute," it added.While Parry remained unequivocal in his support of the plan, the seeds of division have already been sowed.  "Some Premier League club are very much against the proposal," a West Ham source was quoted as saying by the BBC. "The big six are using COVID for a power grab. If this goes through, over time they will just use more and more for themselves." But another Premier League club source told the Guardian that he was confident about the prospect of the plan, adding: "Beggars can't be choosers. It is about saving the game from oblivion." Borussia Dortmund's Youssoufa Moukoko, who turns 16 on November 20, could make Champions League history next month by becoming the competition's youngest player ever. Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc told German daily Bild "we will enter him on the B list" for the group stages of the Champions League, with Dortmund having drawn Zenit Saint Petersburg, Brugge and Lazio in Group F. The 15-year-old Moukoko, already a prolific scorer in German youth football, is not on the club's 'A' list of players registered for the Champions League competition. However, he will be on their 'B' list, which according to UEFA regulations means a 16-year-old can play, provided he has been at the club for at least two years. Moukoko joined Dortmund in 2016. He will turn 16 four days before Dortmund host Brugge in the group stages on November 24, when he could become the youngest player in Champions League history.The record is currently held by Nigeria's Celestine Babayaro, now 42, who was 16 years, 86 days old when he played for Anderlecht against Steaua Bucharest in 1994.He famously lasted just 34 minutes before being sent off, but went on to spend eight years at Chelsea.In 2018/19, Moukoko scored 50 goals in 28 matches for Dortmund's Under-17 side against much older opponents. Last season, aged 14, he moved up to the U19 squad and scored 38 goals in 28 matches.Last month, the 15-year-old scored a hat-trick in his first Under-19 game and has already trained with Dortmund's senior squad.He also made his debut in September for the German U20 national team.However, Sebastian Kehl, head of Dortmund's player department, told SID that the club is keen to dampen the hype around their "wunderkind."Making his professional debut would be "a big step and he is only 15 years old. We must give him the necessary peace and time" to develop, Kehl added.Dortmund currently have two 17-year-olds in their first team in Giovanni Reyna and England junior international Jude Bellingham.Borussia Dortmund's Youssoufa Moukoko, who turns 16 on November 20, could make Champions League history next month by becoming the competition's youngest player ever. Dortmund's sports director Michael Zorc told German daily Bild "we will enter him on the B list" for the group stages of the Champions League, with Dortmund having drawn Zenit Saint Petersburg, Brugge and Lazio in Group F. The 15-year-old Moukoko, already a prolific scorer in German youth football, is not on the club's 'A' list of players registered for the Champions League competition. However, he will be on their 'B' list, which according to UEFA regulations means a 16-year-old can play, provided he has been at the club for at least two years.

Let the better one win!" Pulev later posted in his profile on the social media Facebook.He did not mention if the bout will be behind closed doors due to Covid-19 restrictions as earlier expected, prompting Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn to say he was willing to move the fight to the Middle East if an audience is allowed there.Joshua beat Andy Ruiz to regain the WBA, IBF, WBO and IBO heavyweight titles in Saudi Arabia in December.He is, however, due to put them up for grabs in a mandatory fight with the Bulgarian.Pulev has been waiting for a chance to face Joshua for almost three years now after a shoulder injury forced him out of a world title bout in October 2017.The fight should be Joshua's last before taking on WBC champion Tyson Fury in a lucrative all-British unification bout next year.Fury is set to defend his belt before Christmas before what UK media report will be a springtime clash at Wembley, assuming coronavirus crowd restrictions have been lifted by then.The Daily Mail reports that Fury's rematch with Deontay Wilder has been called off due to the "imminent expiration" of the American's contractual right to the third match between the pair, paving the way for the Gypsy King's bout with Joshua.Kubrat Pulev confirmed on Monday that he will face the world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua in a title bout in London on December 12.Britain's Joshua was originally scheduled to fight Pulev on June 20, with a second date in July also mooted amid the coronavirus pandemic."It's official: Pulev vs. Joshua on December 12 in London," Pulev posted on his official webpage on Monday, adding that the date and place were final and the contract had been signed."There is no way back, no postponement, no rescheduling!...

I don't think today about the 20th and equal Roger on this great number, today is just a Roland Garros victory and that means everything to me," the world number two said."This love story I have with this city and this court is unforgettable."The final, expected by many to be another great clash in one of the sport's greatest rivalries, turned out to be a bit of a surprise as Nadal dominated throughout in a one-sided match with a flawless performance to score his 100th match win in Paris. He raised his game to an unbelievable level from the start, granting his opponent no error space as he answered every ball deep and heavy. Nadal only committed six unforced errors in the opening two sets altogether and maintained his form to produce a high-quality third set before sealing his victory against Djokovic. "Today you showed why you are the king of clay. Today was a tough match, I was outplayed by a better player today," said Djokovic after losing his third Roland Garros final to Nadal and failing to shrink the gap with Federer and the Spaniard for the most major wins. "He did surprise me with the way he was playing, the quality of tennis he was producing, the level. He's phenomenal. He played a perfect match, especially in the first two sets."Heading into the tournament, many were doubtful about Nadal's continuing dominance amid unfavorable weather conditions as well as his lack of usual preparation on clay courts due to the coronavirus pandemic. According to Nadal, this was the toughest test he had ever faced at Roland Garros. But he came through those challenges with potentially his highest level of play in the final to win the tournament.Unforced errors in the more competitive third set gave Djokovic a glimpse of hope that he could turn the match around. However, the king of clay held on, breaking again in the 11th game and bagging the victory. Nadal and Federer, with their haul of 20 majors, now stand three clear of Djokovic, the last active player to beat the Spaniard at Roland Garros.Federer, who has been recovering from knee surgery and just confirmed his participation in the 2021 Australian Open, congratulated his friend."I have always had the utmost respect for my friend Rafa as a person and a champion," he tweeted. "As my greatest rival over many years, I believe we have pushed each other to become better players.""Therefore it is a true honor for me to congratulate him on his 20th Grand Slam victory.

The ultimate joy.This season, for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, had it all. And it ended in the only fashion that they deemed would be acceptable, with them back atop the basketball world.For the first time since Kobe Bryant's fifth and final title a decade ago, the Lakers are NBA champions. James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Lakers beat the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday night to win the NBA Finals in six games.And it was only fitting that James took the top honors as he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player honors for a fourth time."It means a lot to represent this franchise," James said, recalling what he told team owner Jeanie Buss when he arrived in Los Angeles in 2018: "I wanted to put this franchise back where it belongs. For me to be a part of such a historical franchise is an unbelievable feeling."Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who had to deal with the anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise â and against the Heat franchise that showed him how to become a champion.Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler â the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention. Rajon Rondo scored 19 points for the Lakers.With that, the league's bubble chapter, put together after a four-and-a-half-month suspension of play that started on March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic, is over. So, too, is a season that saw political sparring between the league and China, the death on January 1 of commissioner emeritus David Stern â the man who did so much to make the league what it is â and then the shock on January 26 that came with the news that Bryant, his daughter Gianna and seven other had died in a helicopter crash.The Lakers said they were playing the rest of the season in his memory.They delivered what Bryant did five times for L.A. â a ring, and the clincher was emphatic.Game 6 was over by halftime, the Lakers taking a 64-36 lead into the break. The Heat never led and couldn't shoot from anywhere: 35 percent from 2-point range in the half, 33 percent from 3-point range and even an uncharacteristic 42 percent from the line, not like any of it really mattered. The Lakers were getting everything they wanted and then some, outscoring Miami 36-16 in the second quarter and doing all that with James making just one shot in the period.Rajon Rondo, now a two-time champion and the first to win rings as a player in both Boston and Los Angeles â the franchises now tied with 17 titles apiece â was 6 for 6 in the half, the first time he has done that since November 2007. The Lakers' lead was 46-32 with 5:00 left in the half, and they outscored Miami 18-4 from there until intermission.Ball game. The 28-point halftime lead was the second-biggest in NBA Finals history, topped only by the Celtics leading the Lakers 79-49 on May 27, 1985.True to form, the Heat â a No. 5 seed in the Eastern Conference that finished with a losing record last season, a team that embraced the challenge of the bubble like none other â did not stop playing, not even when the deficit got to 36 in the third quarter.A 23-8 run by Miami got the Heat to 90-69 with 8:37 left. But the outcome was never in doubt, and before long confetti was blasted into the air as the Lakers' celebration formally and officially began.The ultimate anguish. The ultimate joy.This season, for LeBron James and the Los Angeles Lakers, had it all. And it ended in the only fashion that they deemed would be acceptable, with them back atop the basketball world.For the first time since Kobe Bryant's fifth and final title a decade ago, the Lakers are NBA champions. James had 28 points, 14 rebounds and 10 assists, and the Lakers beat the Miami Heat 106-93 on Sunday night to win the NBA Finals in six games.And it was only fitting that James took the top honors as he earned NBA Finals Most Valuable Player honors for a fourth time."It means a lot to represent this franchise," James said, recalling what he told team owner Jeanie Buss when he arrived in Los Angeles in 2018: "I wanted to put this franchise back where it belongs. For me to be a part of such a historical franchise is an unbelievable feeling."Anthony Davis had 19 points and 15 rebounds for the Lakers, who had to deal with the anguish that followed the death of the iconic Bryant in January and all the challenges that came with leaving home for three months to play at Walt Disney World in a bubble designed to keep inhabitants safe from the coronavirus.It would be, James predicted, the toughest title to ever win.They made the clincher look easy. James won his fourth title, doing it with a third different franchise â and against the Heat franchise that showed him how to become a champion.Bam Adebayo had 25 points and 10 rebounds for Miami, which got 12 points from Jimmy Butler â the player who, in his first Heat season, got the team back to title contention.

"France are a great team. They have great players. It's not always possible to create opportunities."Pepe headed home what he thought was a 74th-minute opener when he got on the end of Bruno Fernandes' free-kick but was flagged offside.Ronaldo, chasing his 102nd international goal, was denied by a flying save from Hugo Lloris in added time.Mbappe fluffed France's best when Rui Patricio anticipated his gentle chip when one-on-one with the Portuguese stopper.Both sides are now on seven points, four ahead of Croatia, whose 2-1 home win over Sweden earlier on Sunday was the group's more entertaining match, with a calamitous late lapse from Pontus Jansson allowing the 2018 World Cup finalists to snatch the points in a soaking Zagreb.Defender Jansson dawdled under a high ball into the penalty area with six minutes remaining and allowed Ivan Perisic to nip in behind. The Inter Milan winger then squared the ball for Andrej Kramaric to tap in from close range.Sweden are stuck on no points after losing all three of their matches.Elsewhere, Italy stretched their unbeaten streak to 18 matches and held onto top spot in League A, Group 1 with a stalemate in Gdansk.New Juventus signing Federico Chiesa missed the chance to win the match for the dominant Azzurri from close range in the 11th minute.Roberto Mancini's side are one point ahead of the Netherlands, who also drew 0-0 with Bosnia and Herzegovina, ahead of their meeting in Bergamo on Wednesday.England manager Gareth Southgate said his side showed what they were made of after coming from behind to beat Belgium 2-1 and move top of League A, Group 2 earlier on Sunday.The Three Lions are on seven points, one ahead of the world's top-ranked side after Marcus Rashford's spot-kick and Mason Mount's deflected winner 25 minutes from time cancelled out Romelu Lukaku's early penalty."We are not going to face a more difficult game defensively," said Southgate. "That is the beauty of the Nations League, you get games against this level of opponent."It's a great experience for them and to go and win it, (it) should give them a sense of what might be possible in the next few years."Denmark are three points behind England in third after their simple 3-0 win over bottom side Iceland.In League B, Erling Braut Haaland showed what the rescheduled Euro 2020 will be missing after he slammed home a hat-trick to help Norway to a 4-0 thrashing of Romania.Haaland struck in the 13th, 64th and 74th minutes as Norway moved level on six points with group leaders Austria, 1-0 winners at Northern Ireland.Norway were knocked out of the Euros playoffs by Serbia on Thursday.Portugal and Italy kept hold of first place in their UEFA Nations League groups on Sunday with goalless draws against France and Poland respectively on a night of little drama, while England saw off Belgium to take the initiative in their pool.There was little to talk about at the Stade de France as a star-studded line-up of players including Cristiano Ronaldo, Kylian Mbappe and Antoine Griezmann failed to muster much of a spectacle in the League A, Group 3 match.One-thousand fans gathered in the cavernous stadium just outside Paris to watch France host the reigning European champions, but were treated to just four shots on target as two rugged defenses cancelled out each team's attacks."We didn't score a goal, but we weren't here to score goals," said Portugal coach Fernando Santos.

We've played so many times, one day one wins, another day the other wins."Djokovic had won five Grand Slam finals in a row since being beaten by Stan Wawrinka at the 2016 Australian Open, but Nadal was not upset on his turf despite a new stadium design, the roof and the lack of spectators amid the COVID-19 crisis.The 34-year-old Nadal would not think of matching Federer's mark."To win here means everything.

Rally driver Safina Khan has battled critics to ensure women are represented and leads by example.Safina Khan was introduced to Motorsport as a young girl. She did not need to look far for inspiration."It's quite interesting Simon, I actually got into it because of my dad. My father was actually one of the people who was the top most mechanic in the Nissan rally team that time which used to come from Japan to Kenya just to participate in our Safari Rally. so I used to follow him around, he used to take me around on his servicing, when the cars used to come, when they used to go testing, so that is I think when the first bug bit me," says Safina Khan, rally driver.Safina was totally hooked to the "dangerous sport" when she saw an all female crew take part in the iconic Safari Rally."The person who actually sealed the deal for me was when I saw Michelle Mouton and Fabrizia Pons participating in the Safari Rally and I said to myself hey if these ladies can take part in such a powerful machine they were driving an Audi, and a Lancia, Why can't I be part of this one day and the thing which helped me was the fact that I was interested in mechanics so I used to help my dad building the engines doing the servicing and stuff like that at a very young age so I said to myself all I have to do is just follow my passion and that is what I did."Sadly, her chosen career in rallying exposed Safina to ridicule and criticism in a male-dominated sport."But it was a very hard journey I had a lot of naysayers they turned round and said you are going to go and die these cars are going to roll, you will be nowhere to be seen and a woman your place is in the kitchen what are you doing out there that is a man's sport and I said to them no you know what, what the man can do we can do because in the long run we are all humans," Safina submits.Determined to beat all odds and gender discrimination, Safina literary forced her way into the sport."I actually stowed away in one of an auto-cross car that my dad was participating in, in Solai track in Nakuru, I hid the organizers did not see me and when they discovered I was already in the car and we are already on the circuit well its another thing that they had to stop the race just to tell my dad to get me out of the car but then like I said that time I was bitten. From that event I basically continued with school because my father put his foot down and said education first so i had to get back into school and do what I had to do."Upon finishing, school a call came through that changed her life."Then one day I got a call out of the blues from a lady called Michelle, she is also a Kenyan and she asked me whether I was interested in rallying. An our first car was actually a Subaru GC8 we formed a team called ladies luck rally team and we were both Kenyans participating in the circuit in  a subaru Imprezza we did our first rally .... in 1998 that's when we did our first Safari it was very hard. In those day's it was actually a 3,000km event.Since then, Safina has gone on to win 5 coupe de dames trophies in the Safari rally, an Award given for the highest finishing all female crew.She was also crowned as the Kenya Autocross champion in 2018. But her golden moment came when she heard the Kenyan anthem played in Uganda after a stunning performance from her team ladies luck."It was a very important race for us, we started off in the 30's and we actually finished in the top 5 among the top end cars, just me and my driver Michelle, we were the top placed Kenyans. you can imagine the feeling we had when we had our flag across our bonnet, the bonnet of our car, we were taken to the ramp and they played for us our national anthem we actually cried we had tears in our eyes. you know you feel so proud to be Kenyan and to be bringing home the trophies in an alien country or in another country.

For a lot of fighters, one solid hit in the form of a loss is enough to derail them. Ronda Rousey never recovered from Holly Holm; Chris Weidman, who was 13-0 in 2015, has gone a grim 5-2 since his loss to Luke Rockhold; Jose Aldo had his soul taken by a Conor McGregor 13-second KO following 10 years undefeated.In the UFC's current bantamweight division, Cory Sandhagen was one of the top prospects. He entered the UFC with a 7-1 record as a lightweight, but quickly went down to bantam and found himself on a five fight win streak over top guys in his weight class such as John Lineker and Raphael Assuncao. This put him in a championship eliminator against Aljamain Sterling at UFC 250 on June 6 this year.Sandhagen was tapped out in under 90 seconds. It seemed he hadn't planned at all for the smaller cage at the UFC APEX Facility and found himself immediately swallowed up by Sterling who grappled, took his back and then locked in a rear naked choke from a standing position, almost as if he were a human rucksack.He already has a loss on his record, but a unanimous decision is very different to this, the kind of fast, definitive and borderline embarrassing loss that can ruin a fighter, particularly when they are on such a commanding hot streak.His next fight, which took place today at UFC Fight Island 5 against Marlon Moraes, would show if this were a blip or a sign Sandhagen had already peaked. Having lost to then-champion Henry Cejudo at UFC 239 on June 8, 2019, Moraes knew he needed a solid win to get another crack at the belt. He got his win against the aforementioned Aldo at UFC 245 at the end of that year; sadly, that feat doesn't mean much anymore and it looked as if he had spent five rounds sparring with a human punch bag instead of actually fighting.It made sense to match him with Sandhagen and find out who is next in line once #1 Sterling finally faces new champion Petr Yan.Sandhagen, significantly taller and with a longer reach than his Brazilian opponent, began Round 1 by intentionally keeping a distance. Any time Moraes attempted a range-finding jab or one of his trademark football volley-esque leg kicks, he shimmied back. When Sandhagen did engage, it was to maintain this gap; he leaned into his jabs to keep his fist as far away from his body as possible.After two minutes he began engaging in earnest, only, again, due to his height and focus on keeping out of Moraes' danger zone, Sandhagen's leg kicks had him dipping so low, it was as if he were attempting the low sweep from Mortal Kombat. Moraes, not known for his patience, swung for the fences.Sandhagen avoided each and it looked like the round was in the can already, but with two minutes left, it started to look like a high-level ploy. Any time Moraes missed, Sandhagen would close in and start attacking, bringing him close enough for a brawl. Unfortunately, Moraes' reliance on hitting hard rather than hitting fast meant he took more damage than he gave.According to UFCstats.com, Moraes landed 12 significant strikes in the first frame, less than half of Sandhagen's 30. Worse still, Sandhagen's incredible variety meant an almost even spread between the head, body and legs with 11, eight and 11 respectively. Moraes landed two leg kicks and the rest of his offense went to the head.Going into Round 2, Sandhagen knew that his fight plan was working and also that Moraes' wasn't. This confidence was clear as he sprinted to the middle of the Octagon to begin. He peppered Moraes with tap-tap jabs and then followed with harder punches and even a front kick when the Brazilian tried to fight back.With 4:32 remaining in the round, Sandhagen hit a question mark kick that smacked Moraes directly above his right eye. As Moraes recovered, Sandhagen could be heard shouting "his orbital's broke," referring to the orbital bone around the eye that had just been hit and barely 20 seconds later, he hit that bone again with a beautiful spinning heel kick for a TKO win.Cool, calm and clinical. In just over six minutes, Sandhagen turned the Sterling loss from a possible derailment to barely even registering as a blip.In the words of boxing legend Rocky Balboa, "it ain't about how hard you hit, it's about how hard you can get hit and keep moving forward." For a lot of fighters, one solid hit in the form of a loss is enough to derail them. Ronda Rousey never recovered from Holly Holm; Chris Weidman, who was 13-0 in 2015, has gone a grim 5-2 since his loss to Luke Rockhold; Jose Aldo had his soul taken by a Conor McGregor 13-second KO following 10 years undefeated.In the UFC's current bantamweight division, Cory Sandhagen was one of the top prospects. He entered the UFC with a 7-1 record as a lightweight, but quickly went down to bantam and found himself on a five fight win streak over top guys in his weight class such as John Lineker and Raphael Assuncao. This put him in a championship eliminator against Aljamain Sterling at UFC 250 on June 6 this year.Sandhagen was tapped out in under 90 seconds. It seemed he hadn't planned at all for the smaller cage at the UFC APEX Facility and found himself immediately swallowed up by Sterling who grappled, took his back and then locked in a rear naked choke from a standing position, almost as if he were a human rucksack.He already has a loss on his record, but a unanimous decision is very different to this, the kind of fast, definitive and borderline embarrassing loss that can ruin a fighter, particularly when they are on such a commanding hot streak.His next fight, which took place today at UFC Fight Island 5 against Marlon Moraes, would show if this were a blip or a sign Sandhagen had already peaked. Having lost to then-champion Henry Cejudo at UFC 239 on June 8, 2019, Moraes knew he needed a solid win to get another crack at the belt. He got his win against the aforementioned Aldo at UFC 245 at the end of that year; sadly, that feat doesn't mean much anymore and it looked as if he had spent five rounds sparring with a human punch bag instead of actually fighting.It made sense to match him with Sandhagen and find out who is next in line once #1 Sterling finally faces new champion Petr Yan.Sandhagen, significantly taller and with a longer reach than his Brazilian opponent, began Round 1 by intentionally keeping a distance. Any time Moraes attempted a range-finding jab or one of his trademark football volley-esque leg kicks, he shimmied back. When Sandhagen did engage, it was to maintain this gap; he leaned into his jabs to keep his fist as far away from his body as possible.After two minutes he began engaging in earnest, only, again, due to his height and focus on keeping out of Moraes' danger zone, Sandhagen's leg kicks had him dipping so low, it was as if he were attempting the low sweep from Mortal Kombat. Moraes, not known for his patience, swung for the fences.Sandhagen avoided each and it looked like the round was in the can already, but with two minutes left, it started to look like a high-level ploy. Any time Moraes missed, Sandhagen would close in and start attacking, bringing him close enough for a brawl. Unfortunately, Moraes' reliance on hitting hard rather than hitting fast meant he took more damage than he gave.According to UFCstats.com, Moraes landed 12 significant strikes in the first frame, less than half of Sandhagen's 30. Worse still, Sandhagen's incredible variety meant an almost even spread between the head, body and legs with 11, eight and 11 respectively. Moraes landed two leg kicks and the rest of his offense went to the head.Going into Round 2, Sandhagen knew that his fight plan was working and also that Moraes' wasn't. This confidence was clear as he sprinted to the middle of the Octagon to begin. He peppered Moraes with tap-tap jabs and then followed with harder punches and even a front kick when the Brazilian tried to fight back.With 4:32 remaining in the round, Sandhagen hit a question mark kick that smacked Moraes directly above his right eye.

In just over six minutes, Sandhagen turned the Sterling loss from a possible derailment to barely even registering as a blip.When Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski missed out on the chance to win his first Ballon d'Or after the prestigious award was cancelled for the first time since 1956 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland was shocked.As one of the most recognizable Polish stars in the world, Lewandowski was favorite to receive the honor after netting incredible 55 goals in 47 games and helping Bayern win the UEFA Champions League, Super Cup, Bundesliga and German Cup last season. However, the organizers' controversial decision to write off the campaign's achievement broke the 32-year-old and his compatriots' heart."We won everything we could with Bayern. I was the top scorer in all competitions I featured in and I think a player who achieves this would win the Ballon d'Or," a clearly frustrated Lewandowski told Polish reporters back in August.Like many others in the footballing world, he thought he has been robbed of the 2020 Ballon d'Or.Fortunately, nobody could rob Iga Swiatek of the tennis world's biggest trophy. The 19-year-old Polish girl, who arrived in Paris ranked 54 in the world, defied the odds to win the French Open after overwhelming Australian Open winner Sofia Kenin in the final on Saturday.As the youngest women's French Open winner since 1992, Swiatek became the first Pole to win a Grand Slam singles title, eclipsing the run of Polish legend Jadwiga Jedrzejowska, who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939.Lewandowski was among the first to offer congratulations as the whole Poland erupted into celebration. "What an amazing success, what a great story! Good job, Iga Swiatek," he beamed on Twitter.The exhilaration was shared by tennis star Agnieszka Radwanska, who is the first Polish player in the Open Era to reach a Grand Slam singles final in 2012, when he stormed into the Wimbledon Championships final and lost to Serena Williams."Congratulations, Iga Swiatek! A fabulous showing for tennis," Radwanska posted on Instagram.Poland's President Andrzej Duda also expressed his public endorsement. "Great thanks and congratulations for Iga Swiatek! A historic day for Poland, for Polish sport and for Polish tennis. Bravo!" he tweeted.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki also followed suit, tweeting "Huge congratulations to Iga Swiatek, who has achieved today the success of her life and â I am convinced â just the first success in the Grand Slam. Amazing story written by this young girl on the Roland Garros courts! Paris is Polish today!"Seven-time Grand Slam champion Mats Wilander was equally optimistic about the teenager's bright future. "Iga looked so relieved but also calm, she is going to win so many more â you can see that in her demeanor throughout the whole finals," he said via Eurosport.He was echoed by former British No.1 Tim Henman, who told the Guardian: "Her mentality is so strong when she is so young. Those three elements, the physical, technical and mental are all so important and you see her athletic ability, too.""When you reflect on her mentality, how calm she's been, her sense of belonging she's had out on court, it's been incredible all the way through. When you add it all up â 28 games she lost to win a grand slam in seven matches â it's just been a complete domination. She's such a deserving champion."Facing a deluge of congratulatory messages, Swiatek exuded confidence and calm. "I know it's going to be crazy. I think I'm going to get used to that, it's not going to be a problem for me," the Warsaw native said in his post-game interview."I didn't have problem with, like, getting attention, with people surrounding me. I think it's going to be okay for me. I really appreciate all the support I got during whole two weeks. I know that the whole country was behind me and they all believed in me. I'm going to be happy and proud," she noted.Seven of the past eight grand slam titles have been won by players under the age of 23, and Swiatek knows that the new generation of tennis players need to be more ruthless and consistent if they want to achieve dominance in this sport."I know my game isn't developed perfectly," she observed. "Also I think the biggest change for me is going to be to be consistent. I think this is what women's tennis is struggling with.""That's why we have so many new Grand Slam winners because we are not as consistent as Rafa, Roger, and Novak. That's why my goal is going to be to be consistent. It's going to be really hard to achieve that," she added.Swiatek's path to the French Open titleFirst round: beat Marketa Vondrousova  6-1, 6-2Second round: beat Hsieh Su-Wei 6-1, 6-4Third round: beat Eugenie Bouchard 6-3, 6-2Fourth round: beat Simona Halep 6-1, 6-2Quarterfinal: beat Martina Trevisan 6-3, 6-1Semifinal: beat Nadia Podoroska 6-2, 6-1Final: beat Sofia Kenin 6-4, 6-1When Bayern Munich striker Robert Lewandowski missed out on the chance to win his first Ballon d'Or after the prestigious award was cancelled for the first time since 1956 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Poland was shocked.As one of the most recognizable Polish stars in the world, Lewandowski was favorite to receive the honor after netting incredible 55 goals in 47 games and helping Bayern win the UEFA Champions League, Super Cup, Bundesliga and German Cup last season.

His reaggravated heel injury somehow became an Archilles Heel for both the team and himself, unable to lift the trophy with a 4-1 in the series on Friday, but instead, losing to the Heat 108-111.Davis looked painful on the floor, clutching his lower right ankle, and stayed on the bench for the rest of the quarter. His heel problem was already obvious in Game 3, the first game the Lakers lost in the series, in which Davis had 15 points and five rebounds, his worst in this Finals. The Lakers still lead the series 3-2. LeBron James was disappointed for not winning the title on Friday, saying they have to "be better at Game 6 and close the series."The Lakers had a three-point lead midway through the final quarter of Game 5 and let it get away. They led by one after a basket by Davis with 21.8 seconds left and were one stop from winning the title; Davis ended up fouling Butler, a call the Lakers said shouldn't have been made. The NBA disagreed Saturday, saying Butler was fouled on the play."We're motivated to win Game 6 and they are motivated to win Game 6," Davis said.

It is so often right now that it is crazy," said Swiatek, who captured her first tour title in the process."I don't know what's going on. It's overwhelming for me, it's crazy."Two years ago I won a junior Grand Slam (at Wimbledon) and now I'm here. It feels like such a short time," she said.Swiatek is the youngest women's French Open winner since Monica Seles lifted the trophy as an 18-year-old in 1992. She is the first teenage champion since Iva Majoli in 1997."It's crazy for me because I watched Rafael Nadal lift the trophy every year and now I'm in the same place," added Swiatek, the first woman to secure the title without losing a set since Justine Henin in 2007.Swiatek also became just the second unseeded women's Roland Garros champion in the Open era, joining Jelena Ostapenko who claimed a shock title three years ago.  She eclipsed the run of compatriot Jadwiga Jedrzejowska â the most outstanding Polish player of the interwar period â who finished runner-up at Roland Garros in 1939. Swiatek was only the second Polish woman to reach a Grand Slam final in the Open era after Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon in 2012. She had never previously been beyond the last 16.Australian Open champion Kenin, 21, fell short in her attempt to become the first woman to capture two Slams in the same year since Angelique Kerber in 2016."I just want to congratulate Iga on a great tournament and a great match.

The referees only remove their masks to announce penalties. The NFL fined five coaches $100,000 each -- and their teams $250,000 -- for failing to wear masks properly in the early weeks of the season. Meanwhile, the New York Jets sent their team and coaches home on Friday as a precaution after a player received a presumed positive COVID-19 test result. The Jets, who are scheduled to host the Arizona Cardinals on Sunday, will work virtually for the rest of the day and the player will be re-tested. The NFL, which is entering the fifth week of its 2020 schedule, has already pushed back a pair of games originally set for Sunday after a number of positive COVID-19 tests among players and personnel on multiple teams. As a result, the New England Patriots' home game versus the Denver Broncos has been pushed back to Monday, while the Tennessee Titans game against the visiting Buffalo Bills is scheduled for Tuesday. (With input from Reuters)Any coach who approaches a referee without wearing a proper face covering now can be slapped with a 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalty. It is a response to complaints from the NFL Referees Association about coaches and other sideline personnel pulling down their masks to yell at officials from close range. "We have seen multiple occasions where head coaches have removed their masks to communicate with game officials during games," Perry Fewell, the NFL's senior vice president of officiating administration, wrote in the memo. "Doing so creates unnecessary, increased risk for the game official, the head coach, and others, and is inconsistent with the requirement that face coverings be worn at all times. ..."The league's COVID-19 protocols require everyone on the sideline to wear a face covering except for players who are actively involved in the game.

opening 2022 World Cup qualifier on Friday.Barcelona playmaker Philippe Coutinho and Paris Saint-Germain defender Marquinhos also got on the scoresheet while star forward Neymar set up two goals in a totally one-sided encounter that sent Brazil top of the South American qualifying table.In a Corinthians Arena deserted due to COVID-19 restrictions, Bolivia showed almost no ambition as Brazil dominated throughout, with PSG's Neymar starting after overcoming a back problem.Inside the first minute, winger Everton volleyed wide from inside the six-yard box and three minutes later his cross was headed off-target by Marquinhos from a similar position.Bolivia couldn't get out of their half, or on the ball, as Coutinho and Everton created a slew of chances down Brazil's left.The pressure told on 16 minutes as Marquinhos headed home from an identical position to his earlier chance as full-back Danilo swung over a cross from the right following a short corner.Even a first half downpour couldn't dampen Brazil's thrust as Coutinho forced a diving one-handed save from goalkeeper Carlos Lampe with a deflected shot.At times it looked like a handball game with Brazil camped on the edge of Bolivia's box, and the visitors keeping 10 men behind the ball at all times.But on the half hour, left-back Renan Lodi got in behind the defense and his cross from the left was turned home from barely a yard out by Firmino.Lampe made a fine one-handed save from a Casemiro free-kick and then smothered a close range finish by Neymar.By the end of the first half, Bolivia had had less than 20 percent possession and their only shot at goal was a free-kick from 40 yards by Fernando Salidas that didn't even beat the wall.If there were still any doubts Brazil would stroll to victory, they were dispelled three minutes into the second period when a sublime pass from Neymar presented Firmino with a tap-in from six yards.On 65 minutes, a cross from Coutinho flew into the net off the unlucky Jose Carrasco's chest.Coutinho then got on the scoresheet heading home a cross from Neymar from six yards.Neymar's attempts to join retired great Ronaldo as Brazil's second highest scorer of all time were frustrated by an offside flag and an injury time save by Lampe.In the night's other match, Atalanta pair Duvan Zapata and Luis Muriel fired Colombia to a 3-0 win over Venezuela.Zapata slid in a

was originally scheduled for early March, but the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organizers to postpone it to October. However, as several countries still raised concerns over the deadly virus, the tournament was again delayed until November 18.Qatar proved its ability to provide a safe environment for elite competition after the country managed to host the West Zone games for the AFC Champions League without a hitch. Earlier this month, Iranian giants Persepolis were crowned Western champions in Doha after overwhelming Saudi powerhouse Al Nassr 5-3 on penalties. Persepolis will take on the Eastern representative in a single-leg final, which is set to be played on December 19. According to AFC, the venue for the final will be confirmed in due course."We are extremely grateful for the outstanding support of the QFA and are pleased that we can now build on the success of the AFC Champions League (West) while looking forward to the remaining exciting matches in Asia's premier club competition," said Dato' Windsor John, the AFC General Secretary."Everything from the arrival of the teams, the efficient immigration process, the rigorous health screenings, hotels with biosecurity measures, to the state-of-the-art training facilities and stadiums were of the highest possible standard as the AFC insisted that the welfare and well-being of the players, officials and match officials was our top priority," he added.Among four teams from the Chinese Super League, only Beijing Guoan had a single outing, pulling off a 1-0 win over Chiangrai United in Thailand back in February.

Sunday will be their 56th clash."This is the house of Rafa," said Djokovic. "I will have the motivation to win, I beat him here in 2015 but this will be the biggest challenge â playing Nadal on clay."Djokovic hailed Tsitsipas, who was appearing in the semi-final of a Slam for only the second time."Stefanos is a big player but after four hours he was tired. He gave me a lot of trouble. I looked calm on the surface but it was a different story inside," added Djokovic who will be in his 27th Slam final.Djokovic took a 5-1 career lead over Tsitsipas into the semi-final and showing no signs of the neck and shoulder injury which blighted his performance against Pablo Carreno Busta in the last eight, he secured the only break of the opener in the second game.Crucially, he saved all five break points he faced.That became seven from seven early in the second set and he made Tsitsipas pay, breaking for a 3-2 edge and backing it up with another for 5-2.The 22-year-old Greek, appearing in his first French Open semi-final, just couldn't make Djokovic crack.An eighth break point came and went in the second game of the third set with Djokovic breaking for 5-4.Having saved two more break points, Djokovic was unable to convert a match point in the 10th game, picked up a time violation and, unsettled by the call as well as disturbances in the crowd, was broken at the 11th time of asking.From the brink of a quick exit, Tsitsipas stayed alive, taking the third set 7-5.Djokovic squandered 10 break points in the fourth set as Tsitsipas, who had also been two sets down in his opening match against Jaume Munar, levelled the match.However, in a final twist and as the clock ticked closer to the four-hour mark, Tsitsipas faded away in the decider, dropping serve twice to hand Djokovic a 4-1 lead.He saved another match point but was powerless on the third as Djokovic fired a clean winner.For 34-year-old Nadal, his win over Schwartzman was his 99th at Roland Garros.He is into his 28th final at the majors and has not dropped a set in the tournament this year."It's always incredible to play here and this is a very special moment," said Nadal after a 10th win in 11 matches against Schwartzman who had shocked him in Rome last month."I played a couple of bad points in the third set but Diego is a very tough player.

Is not easy playing them five sets because you have to play your best tennis maybe for three, four hours, five hours. Physically it's very hard," he admitted.(With input from agencies)Novak Djokovic set up a blockbuster French Open title showdown with Rafael Nadal on Friday after a dramatic five-set semi-final victory over Greek star Stefanos Tsitsipas.World number one Djokovic, the 2016 champion at Roland Garros, reached his fifth final in Paris, defeating fifth seed Tsitsipas 6-3, 6-2, 5-7, 4-6, 6-1 in a roller-coaster of a contest where he had held a match point in the third set.Nadal, the 12-time champion, defeated Diego Schwartzman 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 (7/0) to make a 13th final at the tournament.On Sunday, Djokovic can win an 18th major and become the first man in half a century to win all four Slams twice.Nadal, the world number two, can equal Roger Federer's all-time record of 20 Grand Slam title wins.Djokovic is one of only two men to have defeated Nadal at Roland Garros in 15 years. Sunday will be their 56th clash."This is the house of Rafa," said Djokovic. "I will have the motivation to win, I beat him here in 2015 but this will be the biggest challenge â playing Nadal on clay."Djokovic hailed Tsitsipas, who was appearing in the semi-final of a Slam for only the second time."Stefanos is a big player but after four hours he was tired. He gave me a lot of trouble. I looked calm on the surface but it was a different story inside," added Djokovic who will be in his 27th Slam final.Djokovic took a 5-1 career lead over Tsitsipas into the semi-final and showing no signs of the neck and shoulder injury which blighted his performance against Pablo Carreno Busta in the last eight, he secured the only break of the opener in the second game.Crucially, he saved all five break points he faced.That became seven from seven early in the second set and he made Tsitsipas pay, breaking for a 3-2 edge and backing it up with another for 5-2.The 22-year-old Greek, appearing in his first French Open semi-final, just couldn't make Djokovic crack.An eighth break point came and went in the second game of the third set with Djokovic breaking for 5-4.Having saved two more break points, Djokovic was unable to convert a match point in the 10th game, picked up a time violation and, unsettled by the call as well as disturbances in the crowd, was broken at the 11th time of asking.From the brink of a quick exit, Tsitsipas stayed alive, taking the third set 7-5.Djokovic squandered 10 break points in the fourth set as Tsitsipas, who had also been two sets down in his opening match against Jaume Munar, levelled the match.However, in a final twist and as the clock ticked closer to the four-hour mark, Tsitsipas faded away in the decider, dropping serve twice to hand Djokovic a 4-1 lead.He saved another match point but was powerless on the third as Djokovic fired a clean winner.For 34-year-old Nadal, his win over Schwartzman was his 99th at Roland Garros.He is into his 28th final at the majors and has not dropped a set in the tournament this year."It's always incredible to play here and this is a very special moment," said Nadal after a 10th win in 11 matches against Schwartzman who had shocked him in Rome last month."I played a couple of bad points in the third set but Diego is a very tough player. He probably makes more breaks on the tour than others.""It's different playing against Djokovic, Federer, Rafa, these guys. Is not easy playing them five sets because you have to play your best tennis maybe for three, four hours, five hours.

It was Schwartzman's first win against Nadal in 10 meetings.However, this time round, the Spaniard held his own against a determined Schwartzman who did his best to push him, even forcing the third set into a tie-break.Nadal, who is yet to drop a set at this year's tournament, is now into his 13th French Open final. He has never lost in the semi-final or final of the tournament.Nadal will face either Novak Djokovic or Stefanos Tsitsipas in Sunday's final as he bids for a record-equalling 20th Grand Slam title.(With input from agencies)Spain's Rafael Nadal progressed to the French Open final following a comfortable win over Argentine Diego Schwartzman on Friday.Nadal, a 12-time champion at Roland Garros, won 6-3, 6-3, 7-6 on Court Philippe Chatrier.Despite Nadal's dominance on clay, the build-up to the match had been made interesting after Schwartzman's stunning straight sets win over Nadal last month at the Internazionali BNL d'Italia.

I always knew that if I would be in a Grand Slam final, it would be at the French Open," Swiatek said on court after becoming the first Polish woman to reach the Roland Garros final in 81 years and the first at any major since Agnieszka Radwanska at Wimbledon eight years ago.She managed to hit through the court well, both off the forehand and backhand, and painted the red clay with winners, amassing 23 during another typical performance at a tournament in which she also snapped top seed Simona Halep's 17-match winning run.Unable to put up much resistance, Podoroska decided to show more aggression and started coming forward to cut down the time for Swiatek to hit her big shots.Swiatek, who also plays in a doubles semi-final on Friday, kept up the tempo and raced to a 4-0 lead before nervous errors allowed Podoroska to avoid a second-set bagel with a break of serve.The Pole, who has lost only 23 games in six matches, broke back immediately, however, and ended Podoroska's ordeal on the first match point with an unreturned serve. Fourth seed Kenin, who beat Spain's Garbine Muguruza to win the Australian Open in February, proved too solid for the 30-year-old Kvitova who had not lost a set en route to her first French Open semi-final since 2012.A mixture of crafty shot placement, superb defense and some scorching backhand winners, combined with too many Kvitova mistakes, put Kenin in command and her only wobble came when she served for the match at 5-4 in the second set but was broken.When she got a second chance to serve it out at 6-5, however, the American could not be denied as Kvitova fired a forehand wide on match point â a shot that rather summed up the Czech's performance."I had tough matches these past two weeks.

He measures 170cm (5ft 7in) and is the same height as Ken Rosewall, who won the last of his eight Grand Slam titles in 1972. Apart from the great Australian, no one of that height or less, has won one of the tennis season's four major tournaments â the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon and the US Open â since 1968, when the sport allowed professionals to enter.Schwartzman is thriving in a world of giants â he is 41cm (1ft 3in) shorter than the tallest Top 50 player, Reilly Opelka, who is 211cm (6ft 11in) â but why is height such a big thing in tennis?  Who is Diego Schwartzman?Named after legendary soccer player Diego Maradona â another sporting superstar from Argentina â Schwartzman always knew he wasnât going to be the traditional height for a tennis player. His childhood nickname is El Peque â a Spanish slang term that roughly translates as "shorty" in English."I have worse problems than being 10 centimeters shorter than everybody else," Schwartzman has said in the past. "When I walk onto a tennis court, I don't think about how tall I am or how much bigger my opponent is. I know there is a difference, but so what?"He has won three ATP singles titles and reached a career-high singles ranking of 11 in June 2018. Before reaching the last four in Paris, his best Grand Slam result was getting to the quarter-finals of the US Open in 2017. He recently beat semi-final opponent Nadal in the Italian Open.  Why is height important in tennis?Itâs partly a question of physics. The taller a player is, the heavier they are and therefore the harder they can hit the ball. It generally means longer arms, which generate more power and afford extra reach, rotation and racket head speed. The crucial advantage, however, is on the serve. Hitting the serve from a greater height means the stroke can be hit harder and with a downward trajectory to make the ball bounce higher on the opponentâs side of the court. The extra height also gives taller players a great margin of error because they have more angles to play with from the point at which the ball is struck.  Have professional players got taller?Definitely. In 1968, when professionals were allowed to enter the major tournaments, the average height of a Grand Slam winner was 176cm (5ft 7in). By 2019, that figure had risen steadily to 186.5cm (6ft 1in). Rosewall was the first Grand Slam champion of the Open era and is also its shortest, the same 170cm height as Schwartzman. The tallest are Juan Martin del Potro and Marin Cilic, the 2009 and 2014 US Open champions respectively, who measure 198cm (6ft 6in).It is not just the champions, the situation is repeating itself across the professional tennis tour. At the end of the 1960s, the average height of a Top 20 player was 181.2cm (5ft 9in). By the end of last year it was 187.5cm (6ft 1in) and the figure is still rising. The average height of the current ATP Top 50 is 188.6cm (6ft 2in) and there are more players taller than 190cm â including two, Opelka and John Isner, topping 200cm (6ft 7in) â than ever before."I think players like me, around my height, are going to be extinct," says the recently retired David Ferrer, who measures 180cm (5ft 9in).The women's game is experiencing a similar trend towards taller players, beginning with Martina Navratilova. The Williams sisters, Petra Kvitova, Maria Sharapova â all 180cm (5ft 9in) or taller â have dominated recent decades in the way that Billie Jean King and Chris Evert dominated the 1960s and 1970s. Both were under 168cm (5ft 6in). How has Schwartzman managed to defy the general rule?By playing to his strengths. Shorter players have a lower center of gravity and better movement around the court. What Schwartzman lacks in power and reach, he more than makes up for in agility and guile. Taller players also tend to tire more easily, because of the extra weight they have to carry around the court, and Schwartzman's endurance is a big asset. Five-set matches, as he showed against the higher ranked Dominic Thiem in Paris, don't worry him.He is also known as one of the, if not the, best returners of serve â he breaks serve regularly in his matches. But the question is whether he can hang on to his own service games to win the big matches. So is there an ideal height for a tennis champion?There have been a wide range of heights of tennis champions. But the current "Big Three" of Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer are tightly bunched between 185cm and 188cm (6ft 1in). They have dominated for more than 15 years between them. They are in the sweet spot of being tall enough to have some kind of height advantage, but not too tall to hamper their speed around the court and their endurance.Many of the next generation of youngsters coming through â Alexander Zverev, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Matteo Berrettini and Daniil Medvedev among them â are over 190cm (6ft 2in), but work hard to ensure their movement is not compromised. Zverev played field hockey as a junior to improve his movement and changes of direction in a low-gravity sport. That may suggest the height trend is set to continue.But the final word can be left to Schwartzman, who told reporters after a French Open win over 208cm (6ft 8in) Kevin Anderson in 2018: "I read David and Goliath when I was young in the school, and I just try to think of that when I see Kevin or the guys who are two meters."It's a spirit that has been serving him well two years on.Video editor and graphics: Paula HarveyThe author is a former Level 4 tennis coach, who has worked with regional and national players in the UK. When Diego Schwartzman beat Dominic Thiem to reach the semi-finals of the French Open in a five-hour-plus epic, the Argentine came a step closer to tennis history. Not just because the 28-year-old had reached his first Grand Slam semi-final â against Rafael Nadal, the 12-time Roland Garros champion â but because Schwartzman would equal the record for the shortest player in the Open era to win a major were he to lift the trophy in Paris on Sunday.Schwartzman is the shortest player in the ATP Tour's top 50.

It was the first national diving competition since January this year.Three Rio Olympics gold medalists Chen Aisen, Shi Tingmao and Ren Qian along with world champions Wang Han and Zhang Jiaqi were joined with 150 other divers at the national event.Staged at the newly constructed Hebei Olympic Sports Center Swimming and Diving Hall, the event was the first leg of the Chinese diving national team's tryouts for the Tokyo Olympic Games which have been disrupted due to the coronavirus pandemic."To restart our tryouts for the Tokyo Olympics, we wiped out the points divers accumulated in previous tryouts and only had them for reference use," said Zhou Jihong, president of the Chinese Swimming Association."That aside, divers also have to adjust to the difficulties with switching venues and fierce nationwide competitions. For them, it is a lot of pressure."Dubbed as the "dream team" with a total of 40 Olympic gold medals in its pocket, the Chinese diving team has maintained the world's highest caliber throughout the years. Despite the inevitable change of hands from the old generation to the young, the team kept its unbeaten streak at the Olympics as well as World Championships with new stars popping up. And it was still the case at this national event. Quan Hongchan, 13, from Guangdong Province delivered a stunning five-round performance at the women's 10-meter platform to claim the gold. She widened the gap against world champion Zhang Jiaqi after the latter had an average third-round diving and maintained her high-quality diving till the very end to top the podium.In a post-game interview, she said she had not thought of defeating a few world champions on the platform."I just follow my coaches' instructions to take the competition as training. To be bold and just go jumping," said Quan.World champion Zhang Jiaqi finished second with 409.10 points, a point enough to outrank foreign players in international competitions."I feel a little bit disappointed because I feel I have more experience and my techniques are much mature than her but I still lost," said Zhang, who was at the top of the podium four years ago at the same competition."I have accepted my defeat but I will keep competing."The star-dubbed men's 10-meter platform on Tuesday featured two Olympic champions as well as four world champions as the 20-year-old Lian Junjie came from behind to outscore Yang Jian in the last jump to finish top at the podium.It was the first time he jumped 409C action with a difficulty of 4.1 in formal competition as he only started to practice it in January."Starting in January, we've been training with the national team and the efforts seem to have paid off," said Lian."I only tried this action for a few times during tests but never in competitions. I'm quite happy with my performance."The points Lian scored at the men's 10-meter platform, together with the scores Peng Jianfeng clocked at the men's one-meter springboard final, both surpassed the champion scores at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.Zhou Jihong spoke highly of divers' performances at this stop and according to her, the event will be joined with two other national championships in January and May next year to serve as the final reference for the national team's selection for the Tokyo Olympic Games."We should stay confident as everyone works hard, and we remain competitive," said Zhou. "As everything can happen when it comes to competitive sports, the only thing we can do is making sure we are doing our best."(Cover image: Yang Hao of Shaanxi competes during the men's 10-meter platform semifinal at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships in Shijiazhuang, north China's Hebei Province, October 6, 2020. /Xinhua)Young divers stunned the viewers while veterans maintained stable form at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships, which came to a successful close on Wednesday in north China's Hebei Province.

She widened the gap against world champion Zhang Jiaqi after the latter had an average third-round diving and maintained her high-quality diving till the very end to top the podium.In a post-game interview, she said she had not thought of defeating a few world champions on the platform."I just follow my coaches' instructions to take the competition as training. To be bold and just go jumping," said Quan.World champion Zhang Jiaqi finished second with 409.10 points, a point enough to outrank foreign players in international competitions."I feel a little bit disappointed because I feel I have more experience and my techniques are much mature than her but I still lost," said Zhang, who was at the top of the podium four years ago at the same competition."I have accepted my defeat but I will keep competing."The star-dubbed men's 10-meter platform on Tuesday featured two Olympic champions as well as four world champions as the 20-year-old Lian Junjie came from behind to outscore Yang Jian in the last jump to finish top at the podium.It was the first time he jumped 409C action with a difficulty of 4.1 in formal competition as he only started to practice it in January."Starting in January, we've been training with the national team and the efforts seem to have paid off," said Lian."I only tried this action for a few times during tests but never in competitions. I'm quite happy with my performance."The points Lian scored at the men's 10-meter platform, together with the scores Peng Jianfeng clocked at the men's one-meter springboard final, both surpassed the champion scores at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games.Zhou Jihong spoke highly of divers' performances at this stop and according to her, the event will be joined with two other national championships in January and May next year to serve as the final reference for the national team's selection for the Tokyo Olympic Games."We should stay confident as everyone works hard, and we remain competitive," said Zhou. "As everything can happen when it comes to competitive sports, the only thing we can do is making sure we are doing our best."(Cover image: Yang Hao of Shaanxi competes during the men's 10-meter platform semifinal at the 2020 Chinese National Diving Championships in Shijiazhuang, north China's Hebei Province, October 6, 2020. /Xinhua)Formula One is set for a record-breaking weekend when the Nuerburgring hosts the first Eifel Grand Prix on Sunday, with six-time world champion Lewis Hamilton having a second go at matching Michael Schumacher's 91 career wins, while Kimi Raikkonen will line up for his 323rd Grand Prix start after equaling Brazilian Rubens Barrichello's record in Russia two weeks ago. The Finnish 'Iceman,' 40, made his Formula One debut with Sauber in 2001 and is now the oldest man in the race. "Record or not, I am approaching this weekend as any other because once you're in the car, it's pretty much the same," said Alfa Romeo driver Raikkonen, 2007 world champion with Ferrari. "It's not something I care about, not really," he added.

I know she plays really aggressive so I needed to have a better first serve percentage and play aggressive myself; I did a great job overall," said Kenin, who won four of her five matches at Roland Garros in three sets."I guess I like winning in three sets. I know it's tough but I'm getting the job done."After a solid start on both sides, Collins served a woeful double fault to hand Kenin the first break of the match, and a 3-2 lead.She held serve and set up another break point at 4-2 but Collins saved it to stay in contention.Kenin was, however, solid on her service games and she bagged the opening set when her opponent's return sailed wide.It was the first time Kenin took a set against Collins in four encounters, and the fourth seed kept her momentum, breaking again for 3-2 in the second set as her unseeded opponent smacked a forehand long.But this time, Collins hit back to level for 3-3 and she started to threaten Kenin's serve, eventually breaking again to level.The comeback was short-lived, though, as Collins quickly fell 4-0 behind in the decider before taking a medical timeout, holding her midriff as she went off the court for treatment before Kenin easily won the remaining two games.(Cover image: Sofia Kenin in action against Danielle Collins during their quarter-finals match on Court Philippe-Chatrier at the French Open in Paris, France, October 7, 2020. /VCG)Fourth seed Sofia Kenin claimed her maiden French Open semi-final spot as she fought to a 6-4 4-6 6-0 victory against fellow American Danielle Collins on Wednesday.The Australian Open champion was kept on her toes for two sets by an opponent who had beaten her in their previous encounters before strolling through the decider to set up a clash with Czech seventh seed Petra Kvitova.Collins was bothered by abdominal pains in the third set, looking unable to give her maximum effort in the finale on court Philippe Chatrier."This is really special, I'm super happy.

He was one of my favorite players, if not my most favored when I was a teenager," Giroud said in reference to the trophy-laden AC Milan legend.  "I'll just carry on and see how far it goes," the Chelsea star added. Now the only player stands in front of him is Thierry Henry, who leads with 51 goals in 123 caps. Judging by Giroud's current fine form, it won't be long before he surpasses the former Arsenal icon.Giroud is accustomed to keeping a low profile and sometimes doesn't get the appreciation he deserves, but he showed the burning fire of ambition when asked whether he was targeting Henry's record. "There's no limit. You have to set yourself goals," observed Giroud. "Let's see when I reach 46, 47 goals."  It was also a historic night for Eduardo Camavinga. The Rennes starlet became the youngest debutant since 1914 last month with an appearance off the bench against Croatia. On Wednesday, Camavinga made history again as he was given his first start in national team color by Didier Deschamps. The youngster duly repaid his coach's trust by delivering an audacious overhead flick for the opener, thus becoming the youngest player to score for France in 106 years. Barcelona striker Antoine Griezmann, PSG talisman Kylian Mbappe, and Bayern Munich's Corentin Tolisso were also on the scoresheet, capping off a wonderful outing for France. Meanwhile, in Lisbon, Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo failed to get off the mark with a goal despite a lively performance against Spain in front of about 2,500 home fans in the stands. The clash served as a test for Portuguese authorities, as 5 percent of the capacity of the Jose Alvalade Stadium was filled, with attendants sitting apart from each other and sticking to social distancing rules. With supporters cheering him on, Ronaldo had a golden chance to break the deadlock just before the hour mark, but the Juventus superstar hit the crossbar with a powerful shot from inside the area.  Atletico Madrid's Joao Felix, who replaced Ronaldo in the 73rd, nearly notched a later winner at the death but fluffed his lines. Before the match, the Spanish football federation (RFEF) announced that Spain and Portugal have signed an agreement to push ahead with their joint bid to host the 2030 World Cup.Spain hosted in World Cup once in 1982, but Portugal has never staged a World Cup before. "Few things can generate more hope and anticipation than the opportunity to organize a World Cup, and we can't think of a better companion than Portugal," said RFEF president Luis Rubiales in a statement. Elsewhere, Germany midfielder Florian Neuhaus scored on his debut, but Turkey came back three times to earn a 3-3 draw. It was Germany's third stalemate in a row and the third straight time that they have failed to win after taking the lead. "I'm disappointed and frustrated. We have had this problem for a while, and the same thing happened in other games," said Germany coach Joachim Low. In other games, Croatia won 2-1 away in Switzerland, while Italy thrashed Moldova 6-0.

After I found rhythm and confidence," Djokovic said afterwards on Court Philippe Chatrier on another damp and chilly night."It was important to stay focused.

He had already won the world cross country championship five months earlier.Up to Wednesday Cheptegei only had the 18th quickest time over the distance with a best in Doha of 26min 48.36secs, over half a minute outside the record.But his performance in August boded well and he was assisted by some rapid pacemakers, notably the Kenyan Nicholas Kimeli who was a world finalist over 5,000 meters, and electronic timing along the track.Another factor for the fan of Manchester United was his footwear, Nike's carbon-plated Nike Vaporfly worn by Ethiopia's Gidey when she ran the earlier 5,000 meters in 14 minutes 6.62 seconds.The 22-year-old was lowering the previous mark of 14min 11.15 held by her compatriot Tirunesh Dibaba since 2008 by over four seconds.Gidey put up the run of her short career a year after taking 10,000 meters silver at the world athletics championships in Doha.With two pacemakers helping her record bid until the 3,000 meters marker Gidey maintained a ferocious pace to etch her name in athletics' record books."I'm happy," said Gidey.

coronavirus-postponed Tokyo Olympics will be slashed by $280 million, organizers said Wednesday, touting a scaled-back, less flashy Games, with cuts to everything from staffing to pyrotechnics.But the final cost of the event -- officially budgeted before the pandemic at 1.3 trillion yen ($12 billion) -- remains unclear because additional expenses caused by the postponement have not yet been made public."Tokyo 2020 believes that this work will help to create a model for future global events including forthcoming Games amid the new normal in which we now live," organizers said in a statement after a presentation to the International Olympic Committee Executive Board. They said they would put out an updated budget, including additional costs linked to postponement and coronavirus counter-measures, by the end of the year. Plans for a lower-key event were unveiled in late September, with measures including fewer free tickets, scrapping athlete welcome ceremonies, and savings on banners, mascots and pyrotechnics. The final shape of the Games remains unclear, with questions including whether spectators will be allowed -- including foreign visitors -- yet to be resolved. The

players, coaches and non-sporting staff to adapt to the huge losses suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a club source said on Wednesday. Staff have been notified by the club of the need to reduce costs after posting a loss of 97 million euros ($113.98 million) in their annual financial report, released on Monday. The employees, including players, have been asked to nominate a representative over the next two weeks to represent them in the negotiations over the changes to their salaries, added the source. Like every major sporting competition, La Liga faced huge disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pausing for three months mid-season before completing the final rounds of fixtures without fans which hit income from ticket sales and merchandise. Barca's accounts on Wednesday made for grim reading, showing a 14 percent drop in revenue from the previous year and the doubling of their net debt to 488 million euros. The club enacted a temporary pay cut of 70 percent at the end of March in the height of the pandemic, lasting the duration of Spain's national state of alarm, which ended in June. Barca's financial troubles also led them to spend the close season lightening the biggest wage bill in European football, offloading Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal for next to nothing, while selling Arthur Melo for 72 million euros and Nelson Semedo for 30 million. They only brought in three players, Miralem Pjanic, Francisco Trincao and Sergino Dest for a combined 112 million euros. They failed to make any extra additions before the transfer window shut on Monday, despite showing interest in Manchester City defender Eric Garcia and Olympique Lyonnais forward Memphis Depay. Meanwhile, Spanish club Valencia did not sign any players in the transfer window due to a 100 million euros fall in revenue as a result of the coronavirus, despite letting eight key squad members leave in the close season. (With input from Reuters)Barcelona have begun a process to reduce the pay of players, coaches and non-sporting staff to adapt to the huge losses suffered due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a club source said on Wednesday. Staff have been notified by the club of the need to reduce costs after posting a loss of 97 million euros ($113.98 million) in their annual financial report, released on Monday. The employees, including players, have been asked to nominate a representative over the next two weeks to represent them in the negotiations over the changes to their salaries, added the source. Like every major sporting competition, La Liga faced huge disruption due to the Covid-19 pandemic, pausing for three months mid-season before completing the final rounds of fixtures without fans which hit income from ticket sales and merchandise. Barca's accounts on Wednesday made for grim reading, showing a 14 percent drop in revenue from the previous year and the doubling of their net debt to 488 million euros. The club enacted a temporary pay cut of 70 percent at the end of March in the height of the pandemic, lasting the duration of Spain's national state of alarm, which ended in June. Barca's financial troubles also led them to spend the close season lightening the biggest wage bill in European football, offloading Luis Suarez, Ivan Rakitic and Arturo Vidal for next to nothing, while selling Arthur Melo for 72 million euros and Nelson Semedo for 30 million. They only brought in three players, Miralem Pjanic, Francisco Trincao and Sergino Dest for a combined 112 million euros. They failed to make any extra additions before the

James scored 28 points as the Los Angeles Lakers moved to within one win of a 17th NBA championship on Tuesday with a 102-96 victory over the Miami Heat.Humbled by Miami in game three on Sunday, James and the Lakers came roaring back in a hard-fought defensive battle that was finely balanced until Los Angeles pulled away in the closing minutes.The win leaves the Lakers 3-1 up in the best-of-seven series, meaning they can clinch the championship with victory in game five in Orlando on Friday."It felt like both teams were desperate, understanding the situation they had put themselves in," James said afterwards."Trying to get every extra possession, execute offensively, not to make mistakes defensively, that's what it was all about."James started slowly but clicked in the second half to lead the scoring while providing eight assists and hauling down 12 rebounds.Anthony Davis meanwhile finished with 22 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with a vital 15 point contribution.Caldwell-Pope's tally included a three-pointer and a layup in the closing stages that put the Lakers seven points ahead with two minutes remaining.Davis then drained only his second three-pointer of the night with 39.5 seconds left on the clock to give the Lakers a 100-91 lead and effectively seal the contest.Butler, the 40-point hero of Miami's win on Sunday, was restricted to 22 points, frustrated throughout by a commanding defensive display from Davis."He challenges me every night, I challenge him every night," James said of Davis. "We have to do things to help our team win, defensively, and offensively, and he did that tonight â he was spectacular."Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the game had been decided in key moments in the closing stages."There was some moments of truth there at the end, and probably the bottom line is they won those moments of truth," Spoelstra said."It came down to making plays. They just made more plays and more shots to seal it."An attritional contest saw defenses on top throughout, with Miami containing the threat of James and Davis for long periods.James in particular struggled to generate his usual rhythm throughout the first half, giving up five turnovers and scoring just eight points.The Lakers looked to have built a head of steam towards the end of the first quarter, edging into a 27-22 lead after a Kyle Kuzma three-pointer and a driving layup from Alex Caruso.But Miami responded swiftly at the start of the second quarter, transforming a five-point deficit into a 33-29 lead after Jae Crowder's three-pointer.Butler, meanwhile had started smoothly, going five-from-five in the first quarter to move into double figures.Despite Miami's defensive efforts, the Lakers were still able to carve open a series of good looks, only for off-target shooting to let them down.Nevertheless the Lakers had inched into a two-point lead at half-time at 49-47.In the third quarter, James' shooting from distance improved, his first three-pointer of the night coming with a 29-foot effort to put the Lakers ahead at 55-54.A Danny Green bucket was followed by a driving layup from James and the Lakers had suddenly moved into a 59-54 lead.James made another long-range three shortly afterward to put the Lakers 62-57 up with 6:44 left in the third.Davis's first three-pointer of the game from 28 feet put the Lakers seven points clear with two minutes left in the third.The Los Angeles big man closed the quarter with four free throws to leave the Lakers five points clear heading into the fourth.The Lakers maintained that advantage for much of the fourth quarter.Tyler Herro's three-point jump shot cut the Lakers lead to one point at 76-75, but three free throws from Markieff Morris followed by a superb fadeaway from James stretched the Los Angeles cushion to six points midway through the fourth.Butler raised Miami's hopes after tying it at 83-83, but the Lakers pulled away with Caldwell-Pope's three-pointer transition followed by a layup to make it 95-88 with two minutes left on the clock.Rajon Rondo's layup was then followed by a Davis crucial three-pointer with 39.5 seconds left which sealed the win. LeBron James scored 28 points as the Los Angeles Lakers moved to within one win of a 17th NBA championship on Tuesday with a 102-96 victory over the Miami Heat.Humbled by Miami in game three on Sunday, James and the Lakers came roaring back in a hard-fought defensive battle that was finely balanced until Los Angeles pulled away in the closing minutes.The win leaves the Lakers 3-1 up in the best-of-seven series, meaning they can clinch the championship with victory in game five in Orlando on Friday."It felt like both teams were desperate, understanding the situation they had put themselves in," James said afterwards."Trying to get every extra possession, execute offensively, not to make mistakes defensively, that's what it was all about."James started slowly but clicked in the second half to lead the scoring while providing eight assists and hauling down 12 rebounds.Anthony Davis meanwhile finished with 22 points, while Kentavious Caldwell-Pope chipped in with a vital 15 point contribution.Caldwell-Pope's tally included a three-pointer and a layup in the closing stages that put the Lakers seven points ahead with two minutes remaining.Davis then drained only his second three-pointer of the night with 39.5 seconds left on the clock to give the Lakers a 100-91 lead and effectively seal the contest.Butler, the 40-point hero of Miami's win on Sunday, was restricted to 22 points, frustrated throughout by a commanding defensive display from Davis."He challenges me every night, I challenge him every night," James said of Davis. "We have to do things to help our team win, defensively, and offensively, and he did that tonight â he was spectacular."Miami coach Erik Spoelstra said the game had been decided in key moments in the closing stages."There was some moments of truth there at the end, and probably the bottom line is they won those moments of truth," Spoelstra said."It came down to making plays.

Then the Ukrainian Association of Football (FFU) announced on Tuesday that Real Madrid's youngster Andriy Lunin and FC Oleksandriya's veteran Yuriy Pankiv also contracted the virus.Dynamo Kiev's 26-year-old Georguiy Buschan will be the only fit goalie for Ukraine coach Andriy Shevchenko, whose task of preparing for the upcoming UEFA Nations League was further complicated by the withdrawal of five other Shakhtar Donetsk players due to coronavirus concerns."The situation is difficult. Let's see what the organizers say," FFU spokesman Oleksandr Glyvynsky told reporters when asked whether their match against France should be canceled. Meanwhile, the Portuguese football federation confirmed that their defender Jose Fonte will miss Wednesday's friendly with Spain after testing positive for COVID-19.The 36-year-old Lille star, who moved to Chinese Super League side Dalian Yifang in a shocking move in 2018, will be replaced by Granada's Domingos Dauarte, according to their coach Fernando Santos.In Switzerland, the Swiss football federation (SFV) announced that Xherdan Shaqiri, who traveled to St. Gallen ahead of their team's friendly with Croatia on Wednesday, has contracted the coronavirus.He became the third Liverpool player to test positive for the virus in a week, following Spanish midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Senegalese striker Sadio Mane. It remains unclear if Switzerland players who have been in contact with Shaqiri will be quarantined, with SFV only revealing that they will comply with COVID-19 rules imposed by health authorities.Both world champions France and European champions Portugal reported new COVID-19 cases ahead of their international fixtures, while Ukraine were dealt a huge blow after eight players withdrew from the squad due to a surge in coronavirus infections.Lyon right-back Leo Dubois was confirmed to have contracted COVID-19 after testing positive following Tuesday evening's training session, according to the French football federation.The 26-year-old was immediately sent home and placed in quarantine with Real Madrid's Ferland Mendy being temporarily drafted in to fill the gap.The side of Didier Deschamps are set to play against Ukraine on Wednesday but the warm-up match has been thrown into chaos after three Ukrainian goalkeepers tested positive for coronavirus.Shakhtar Donetsk's Andriy Pyatov was the first to come down with COVID-19 earlier in the week.

On my level, it's impossible to keep that level of consistency," said Swiatek, who broke the 159th-ranked Trevisan six times."I just stayed, like, really down-to-earth and really positive. I did that pretty well," she said.World number 131 Podoroska, who had never won a Grand Slam main draw match before the tournament, became the first qualifier in the Open era to reach the women's last four at Roland Garros.Swiatek, ranked 54th, is also through to her first major semi-final and cited the success of Osaka, who captured her third Grand Slam title last month, as a factor in her breakout performance."It was inspiring," Swiatek said of Osaka's return to form in New York after an indifferent 18 months for the Japanese star."I also know I can do better sometimes. I just kept working. Naomi is a good example of a player that just did the right work, and result was the effect of that."Podoroska stunned third seed Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-4 and joined exclusive company as only the third female qualifier to make the last four of a Grand Slam.Podoroska will now attempt to become the first qualifier in history to advance to the final of any of the four majors.Alexandra Stevenson reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1999 while Christine Dorey achieved a similar run at the 1978 Australian Open. "My dream is to be number one. That will never change," said Podoroska, whose only other Grand Slam appearance came at the 2016 US Open.""I don't want to wake up," added Podoroska, the first Argentine woman to reach a major semi-final since Paola Suarez in Paris in 2004. Gabriela Sabatini, the 1990 U.S. Open winner, is the country's only women's Grand Slam singles champion.Meanwhile, Argentine and 12th seed Diego Schwartzman defeated U.S. Open champion and third seed Dominic Thiem in a five-hour epic to reach the Roland Garros semi-finals, his first ever Grand Slam last-four appearance.The 28-year-old Schwartzman triumphed 7-6 (7/1), 5-7, 6-7 (6/8), 7-6 (7/5), 6-2 and will face either 12-time champion Rafael Nadal or Italian teenager Jannik Sinner for a place in the final.It was one marathon too many for Thiem, the runner-up in Paris for the last two years, who had needed five sets and three and a half hours to down world number 239 Hugo Gaston in the fourth round.Schwartzman's success came on the same day that compatriot Nadia Podoroska, the world 131st, reached the last-four of the women's singles."Dominic is one of the great players. He is my best friend and I have a lot of respect for him," said Schwartzman. "So this win is very important for me. In the second and third sets, I was going a little crazy and I was screaming at myself because I had so many chances."But, come on, I deserved to win tonight," added Schwartzman who defeated Nadal in the Rome quarter-finals on the eve of the French Open.Thiem had been attempting to reach a fifth successive semi-final in Paris.However, despite crunching 65 winners to his opponent's 47, he committed 81 unforced errors in a match which featured 19 breaks of serve and at five hours and eight minutes was the second longest of the tournament.Iga Swiatek said she drew inspiration from U.S Open winner Naomi Osaka after sweeping into the semi-finals of the French Open on Tuesday by ending the run of her opponent, Italian qualifier Martina Trevisan.The Polish teenager followed up her emphatic win over top seed Simona Halep by defeating Trevisan 6-3, 6-1 to set up a meeting with Argentina's Nadia Podoroska."I just knew that I'm not going to play as perfect as with Simona.

"Roger this morning just confirmed publicly he'll be here," said Tiley in a video conference on Sunday. If Federer shows up at the Melbourne Park by then, it will mark his Grand Slam comeback after a prolonged injury break. In February, the 20-time Grand Slam champion had an arthroscopic surgery on his right knee, which led to him skipping the Dubai, Indian Wells, Bogota, Miami and the French Open. In June, he made a follow-up decision, announcing he would be missing the rest of the season due to a setback during rehabilitation and an additional arthroscopic procedure that followed. "I plan to take the necessary time to be 100 percent ready to play at my highest level," said Federer in a statement on Twitter back then. As revealed by his coach Severin Luthi in a September's interview, Federer has been committed to making a return at Grand Slam tournaments next year and there are plans to begin to take to the court in early October. The last tour-level tournament Federer played was the Australian Open in January this year, where he lost to Novak Djokovic in straight sets in the semifinals. The 2020 Australian Open was the only Grand Slam tournament of the season that was not affected by the coronavirus pandemic; however, going forward, the event has to gear up with all necessary safety measures against the COVID-19."Bubbles" in cities across Australia will be established to accommodate players arriving early, providing them with a safe environment leading up to the Grand Slam."(Players) will have two weeks of quarantine that they will do in cities around Australia, and for those two weeks, we're creating a bubble from the hotel to the courts in a training environment," said the tournament's director Craig Tiley. "By then, we expect the border to be completely open, and we can move from city to city and then come down to Melbourne for the Australian Open for the last two weeks of January."According to Tiley, the tournament will allow up to 50 percent of the public for games. This is significant progress in comparison with this year's U.S. Open, which was played without fans, and the ongoing French Open allows only a handful of spectators.It will also pose a big challenge for tournament organizers as the state of Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, accounts for 90 percent of Australia's 894 COVID-19-related deaths, and is witnessing a recent rise in the number of cases. (Cover image: Roger Federer of Switzerland plays a backhand in his semi-final match against Novak Djokovic of Serbia on day eleven of the 2020 Australian Open at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia, January 30, 2020. /VCG)After an injury setback that kept him out for most of the 2020 season, Roger Federer will finally return to competitive tennis at the 2021 Australian Open, slated to start on January 18, 2021. According to the tournament's director and CEO of Tennis Australia Craig Tiley, the Swiss tennis great confirmed he is participating.

"I've worked really hard during the time off and I feel eager to compete and represent this incredible club." The arrival of left-back Telles from Porto for 13.5 million pounds ($23.85 million) is arguably even more important to aid a United defense that has conceded 11 goals in three Premier League games to start the season. "He is a player we have been tracking for some time and his performances over the past few years are exactly what we are looking for," said Solskjaer on the Brazilian international. Thomas Partey has been a long-term target for the Gunners, who have reportedly matched his 50-million-euro buyout clause to bolster their threadbare midfield options. The Ghanian has made 188 appearances for the Spanish giants and was part of the Atletico sides that reached the 2016 Champions League final and beat Arsenal on the way to winning the Europa League in 2018. Uruguayan international Lucas Torreira is expected to go the other way from Arsenal to Atletico on a season-long loan deal. Arsenal have made an impressive start to the season, winning three of their opening four Premier League games, as they aim to return to the Champions League next season for the first time in five years. However, the Londoners have been short in central midfield with Mesut Ozil and Matteo Guendouzi, who has joined Hertha Berlin on a season-long loan, frozen out by Mikel Arteta. Premier League table-toppers Everton signed center-back Ben Godfrey for a reported initial fee of 25 million pounds. Europe's giants busy on transfer final day. Juventus secured one of the hottest properties in Italian football as Federico Chiesa joined from Fiorentina on a two-year loan deal worth 10 million euros with an obligation to buy if certain conditions are met for a further 40 million. English defender Chris Smalling returned to Roma on a permanent deal from Manchester United for 15 million euros after impressing during a loan spell last season. French midfielder Tiemoue Bakayoko has also returned to Serie A, joining Napoli on loan from Chelsea. Bayern Munich added a trio of new players as Douglas Costa returned to the Allianz Arena for a second spell on loan from Juventus. The European champions also signed former PSG striker Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting on a one-year deal and Bouna Sarr from Marseille. However, Barcelona's financial problems meant they could not agree deals for Lyon's Memphis Depay or Manchester City defender Eric Garcia, as the Catalan club revealed 97 million euro losses for the past season due to the coronavirus pandemic. Manchester United swooped for Edinson Cavani, Alex Telles and Amad Diallo on Monday, but Arsenal are expected to complete the biggest deal of transfer deadline day with the arrival of Atletico Madrid midfielder Thomas Partey. United were under the spotlight to respond to a humiliating 6-1 home defeat to Tottenham in the Premier League on Sunday. Dutch international midfielder Donny van de Beek had been the only addition to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's squad of the window prior to Monday. Cavani, 33, has been a free agent since leaving Paris Saint-Germain in June and signed a one-year deal with the option for a second season. The Uruguayan scored 200 goals in seven seasons in the French capital to become the club's all-time top goalscorer. "Manchester United is one of the greatest clubs in the world, so it is a real honor to be here," said Cavani.

It will also be his 11th in a row in Paris. He had a heart-stopping moment in the first set when he stretched for a forehand and was unable to avoid seeing the ball accidentally hit a line judge. The incident came just weeks after he was defaulted at the U.S. Open for swiping at a ball which felled a line judge standing behind him, but he was not penalized this time. Djokovic will next face Spain's 17th seed Pablo Carreno Busta, who claimed a 6-2 7-5 6-2 victory over 22-year-old German wildcard Daniel Altmaier. Meanwhile, Stefanos Tsitsipas reached the quarter-finals of a Grand Slam for the second time as he brushed aside Grigor Dimitrov 6-3 7-6(9) 6-2. 19-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner, the first man to reach the Roland Garros quarter-finals on debut since 12-time champion Rafa Nadal in 2005, will take on the King of Clay on Tuesday.  U.S. Open winner Dominic Thiem will also be in action on Tuesday, facing Rome finalist Diego Schwartzman for a place in the semi-finals. On the women's court, American fourth seed Sofia Kenin recovered from a wobbly start to reach the quarter-finals with a 2-6 6-2 6-1 victory over Franceâs Fiona Ferro. (With input from agencies)Novak Djokovic racked up his 35th win of 2020 and a place in the Roland Garros quarter-finals for the 14th time with a 6-4, 6-3, 6-3 win over Russia's Karen Khachanov on Monday. The world No.1, chasing a second title in Paris and 18th career Grand Slam, has yet to drop a set in the tournament, losing just 25 games in four rounds. "It was a tight match and I am happy to win in straight sets," said the Serb, who has now reached 47 quarter-finals at the Slams.

a rare scene as most sports leagues in the country still limit the audience to a moderate amount. First played in 2007, the charity basketball game was led by the country's iconic basketball legend Yao Ming's YAO Foundation and was aimed at promoting the development of physical education in China's rural regions as well as reuniting society through sport. This year, it set out with a more important mission as it was deliberately staged in Wuhan to pass on the "spirit of sports" and inject energy and passion into the city and local people. Medical staff who worked on the frontline fighting the coronavirus were part of the lineup and a special ceremony was held before the game to pay tribute to the heroes who fought COVID-19. Celebrities such as China's first Winter Olympics gold medalist Yang Yang, renowned news commentator Bai Yansong, actor and philanthropist Pu Cunxin attended the event to leverage their influence and show their support to the cause. The Yao Foundation Charity Game originated from a post-game talk Yao Ming had with former NBA guard Steve Nash, with Nash proposing charity games as a way to raise funds for China's various youth charities. Ten of these games have been held since the first in 2007. "You feel the sense of achievement when each year's Charity Game successfully concludes," said Yao Ming. "As it goes however, I realized that it transformed into some responsibilities and something you can't live without."In 2012, the Yao Foundation Hope Primary School Basketball Season, a project aimed at providing more teenagers in underprivileged regions with the opportunities and resources to play basketball was launched. As of 2019, the foundation had sent out 2,240 volunteers, and almost 1.15 million schoolchildren in rural areas have benefited from the program.The focus on prioritizing children's physical education and development through sports also got passed on to the charity game as, starting in 2013, a special third quarter was designated to feature children players from primary schools. Zhang Jiacheng, the remarkable one-armed teenage basketballer, joined other primary school kids in the Sunday's game and took the event to a climax with his impressive basketball skills. In the end, the Chinese Star Team led by the Chinese national basketball head coach Du Feng overcame the special team comprised of medical staff together with foreign players and entertainment stars 122-107. (Cover image: China's basketball national team player Kyranbek Makan celebrates after scoring during the Yao Foundation charity game in Wuhan, central China's Hubei Province, October 4, 2020. /VCGBasketball and other sports stars, medical workers, celebrities as well as local children contributed to a memorable charity basketball game on Sunday night in Wuhan to together boost the city's confidence in the post-pandemic era. More than 7,500 cheered the players on at the stadium -
