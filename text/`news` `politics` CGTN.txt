Chinese President Xi Jinping has called on the entire Party (the Communist Party of China) and society to respect heroes, learn from and care for them, so as to gather the mighty strength for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.Xi made the remarks in a reply letter to all members of a sanatorium for injured and disabled revolutionary military veterans in southwest China's Sichuan Province, as China observes the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer (CPV) army entering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.Appreciating the veterans for their devotion in defending the country and their firm belief in the Party over the past six decades, Xi said the CPV, carrying forward the great spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, had marched forward gallantly, fought dauntlessly, and made vital contributions to safeguarding the motherland.The Party and the Chinese people will never forget their great contribution, Xi said.The Chinese nation has seen many heroes in history, and will continue to see more heroes in the new era, Xi stressed, calling on the whole society to learn CPV soldiers' heroic deeds.The sanatorium, built-in 1951, has served a total of over 2,800 injured and disabled veterans. Some 2,200 of them participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.(With input from Xinhua)Chinese President Xi Jinping has called on the entire Party (the Communist Party of China) and society to respect heroes, learn from and care for them, so as to gather the mighty strength for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.Xi made the remarks in a reply letter to all members of a sanatorium for injured and disabled revolutionary military veterans in southwest China's Sichuan Province, as China observes the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer (CPV) army entering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.Appreciating the veterans for their devotion in defending the country and their firm belief in the Party over the past six decades, Xi said the CPV, carrying forward the great spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, had marched forward gallantly, fought dauntlessly, and made vital contributions to safeguarding the motherland.The Party and the Chinese people will never forget their great contribution, Xi said.The Chinese nation has seen many heroes in history, and will continue to see more heroes in the new era, Xi stressed, calling on the whole society to learn CPV soldiers' heroic deeds.The sanatorium, built-in 1951, has served a total of over 2,800 injured and disabled veterans.

Reuters reported on Wednesday, though the Chinese mainland has repeatedly warned the U.S. to stop the deal.Citing Pentagon, Reuters said the U.S. State Department had approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan authorities, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion.Last week, the White House said they were moving forward with five separate sales of sophisticated military equipment to the island with a total value of around $5 billion.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin Corp, called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing Co, for an estimated $1 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow Wednesday's, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defense cruise missiles.Sources have said the 100 cruise missiles stations and 400 missiles would have a cost of about $2 billion.The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales, but Reuters said this is unlikely given broad bipartisan support for Taiwan.China has repeatedly warned the U.S. not to move forward the arms sales as the two countries' relations are under strain since the COVID-19 pandemic.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said last week that U.S. arms sales to China's Taiwan region severely damaged China's sovereignty and security interests.The United States is seriously violating the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, especially the August 17 communique, by selling arms to Taiwan, thereby seriously interfering in China's internal affairs, Zhao said in a daily briefing on October 13.He urged Washington to cancel the planned sales and warned that China would make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops.The U.S. State Department has formally notified the Congress of the planned

on Wednesday the State Department was designating six more China-based media companies in the U.S. as foreign missions, despite China's opposition.Previously in June, the U.S. had announced to treat four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies.Following the move, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had criticized Washington's actions, calling them further proof of the U.S.'s political oppression of the Chinese media."We strongly urge the U.S. to discard the Cold War mentality and ideological bias, and immediately stop and correct these damaging and harmful actions," MOFA spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said."The US has gone too far," Editor-in-Chief of Global Times Hu Xijin tweeted following the announcement. "The move will further poison working environment of media outlets in each other's country.

The officer went astray as he responded to a request from herders to help them search for yaks late Sunday.It started at the 38th parallel north.On June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).Within two days, the U.S. government ordered troops to invade the DPRK and sent its Seventh Fleet into China's Taiwan Straits.On July 7, the United States manipulated the United Nations (UN) Security Council to adopt a resolution on dispatching a UN force that it led to the Korean Peninsula. The United States mobilized a third of its army, half of its navy and a fifth of its air force to join the war. Its peak troop strength topped 300,000.On September 15, the U.S. forces conducted the Incheon Landing, forcing the DPRK forces to retreat. Meanwhile, U.S. military planes intruded into China's airspace, bombing airports and infrastructure along its border with the DPRK.Do not step across the 38th parallel, China repeatedly cautioned. But the United States ignored the warning. Its army poured across the line on October 7 and pressed on towards the Sino-Korean border.The next day, at a time when China's national security was threatened and upon receiving then DPRK leader Kim Il Sung's urgent request for aid, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) was formed.On October 19, the CPV crossed the Yalu River to fight together with the DPRK army.It could have been a one-sided war. In 1950, China's industrial and agricultural output was 1/12 of the U.S. total, while its steel output 1/144 of the U.S. total.During the war, the U.S. military used all the latest weapons (other than nuclear), while the CPV mainly relied on infantry and limited artillery. The two sides were heavily mismatched in weapons, equipment, logistics and food supplies. But what happened next was beyond expectation.On October 25, the CPV launched the first battle, driving back the enemy forces to the Chongchon River.On November 7, the second battle started, ending with the U.S.-led army retreating to the south of the 38th parallel.Up to June 1951, the CPV launched five major battles in seven months that inflicted heavy losses on the UN force led by the United States, and essentially fixed the front around the 38th parallel.On July 10, 1951, the first truce talks began at Kaesong, near the 38th parallel.For the next two years, the Korean War continued as a stalemate â both negotiations and combat went on.On October 14, 1952, the Battle of Triangle Hill began. It was a hill covering 3.7 square kilometers.The United States had planned to seize the area with two battalions in five days at the expense of 200 casualties â but it ultimately cost 60,000 troops, 43 days and 25,000 casualties before the battle ended.Over 11,000 CPV soldiers were wounded or killed in the battle.On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in the village of Panmunjom, ending the 33-month War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.According to China's official release, more than 1.093 million enemy combatants were killed, wounded or captured. In the United States, the Korean War has been called "the Forgotten War."To protect their motherland, a total of 2.9 million CPV soldiers entered the battlefield and 197,653 sacrificed their lives, according to the latest data. For China, history will never be forgotten, and the heroes will be remembered.Managing editor: Hu YiweiVideo editor: Yu QianhuiAnimation &amp; graphics: Xu Qianyun, Chen Yuyang, Yin YatingVoiceover: Zeng ZiyiCopy editor: John GoodrichChief editor: Wang DeweiProducer: Dang ZhengManaging director: Mei YanSeventy years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) crossed the Yalu River and fought alongside the army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) against the Republic of Korea (ROK) and U.S.-led UN forces.A total of 2.9 million CPV soldiers entered the battlefield, 197,653 of whom sacrificed their lives in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953 Korean War).As 2020 marks the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, here are five facts you may not know about the conflict:1. China, U.S. never officially declared warNeither China nor the United States officially engaged in the conflict as nation states: China sent aâvolunteerâ force and the U.S. dominated and led UN forces. On June 27, 1950, two days after the war in Korean Peninsula broke out, U.S. President Harry Truman ordered navy and air force to intervene and the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait. Three days later he approved the use of ground forces on the Korean Peninsula.The U.S. Constitution states that Congress should decide when and where the country should go to a war. However, Truman's order was made without congressional approval, and war was never officially declared.Truman later argued a United Nations resolution gave him authority, but he ordered armed forces to the peninsula before the UN acted and before an agreement with the UN was reached.China sent forces under the banner of "volunteers" following a request for help from the DPRK and to protect China's national sovereignty, security and interests.Chairman Mao Zedong on October 8, 1950 issued an order saying, "In order to assist the Korean people's war of liberation against the attacks of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, thereby safeguarding the interests of the people of Korea, China and the other countries in the East, I hereby order to change the Northeastern Border Defense Army into the CPV."On October 19, 1950, as requested by the DPRK, CPV forces crossed the Yalu River to aid the DPRK's fight.The CPV launched its first battle on October 25 against a battalion of Syngman Rhee's troops. In 1951, the CPC Central Committee decided to commemorate the war annually on that date.2. Misperception between China and the U.SThe Chinese government repeatedly cautioned that if U.S. forces crossed the 38th parallel China would not sit idle, but the U.S. disregarded the warning, seeing it as only diplomatic parlance.After the U.S.-led UN forces landed at Inchon, 160 kilometers south of the 38th parallel, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai publicly warned on September 30, 1950 that, "The Chinese people enthusiastically love peace, but in order to defend peace they never have been and never will be afraid to oppose aggressive war.""The Chinese people absolutely will not tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they supinely tolerate seeing their neighbors being savagely invaded by imperialists," he added.On October 1, 1950, DPRK leader Kim Il Sung sent a telegram to Mao reporting the grim picture on the battlefield and requesting military aid from China.Since diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. had not been established, Indian Ambassador Kavalam Madhava Panikkar acted as a communication channel between the two camps.On October 2, Zhou formally notified Panikkar that if the U.S. crossed the 38th parallel, China would act. In Washington, Secretary of State Dean Acheson dismissed the warning as the "mere vaporings of a panicky Panikkar."In a document titled "Two Strategic Intelligence Mistakes in Korea, 1950," the CIA admitted U.S. intelligence erred: it believed that China, with limited military and economic capability, would not follow through on its warnings.U.S. forces crossed the 38th Parallel on October 7, and the CPV launched its first battle on October 25.3. Soviet Union sent air supportDeclassified documents from Russia show the Soviet Union was closely involved in the Korean War.In addition to diplomatic and logistical support, the Soviet Union sent air forces to the war from early November 1950. In order to avoid the appearance of direct military clashes with the U.S., Soviet pilots wore CPV uniforms and their aircraft carried CPV or DPRK markings.Records from the Soviet 64th Fighter Aviation Corps claim that from November 1950 till July 1953, the Soviets shot down 1,309 U.S. planes.The Soviet Union provided the CPV with enormous supplies of weapons, equipment and ammunition. China's military debt to the Soviet Union reached 3 billion yuan during the war.4. Japan was a major beneficiary Japan, which didn't send troops to the battlefield, was a major economic beneficiary during the Korean War. U.S. troops were stationed in Japan, so military goods were often purchased from Japanese companies. These companies received more than $3.5 billion over the three years of the conflict. Japan's production increased by nearly 70 percent and military procurement peaked at a level equivalent to seven percent of Japan's gross national product in 1953. By the time the three-year war ended in a truce, Japan's gross domestic product had returned to pre-World War II levels.  5. A never-ending war The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, but a peace treaty is yet to be inked. So although hostilities ceased in 1953, the war has not formally ended. "We cannot commemorate the Korean War in a genuine manner yet. That is because the war has yet to come to an end," ROK President Moon Jae-in said in June when attending a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader, Kim Jong Un, paid tribute to Chinese People's Volunteers(CPV) martyrs in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the CPV army entering the DPRK during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, local media reported.The Korean Central News Agency(KCNA) reported on Thursday that Kim, together with DPRK officials, visited CPV's martyrs tower at the cemetery for martyrs of the CPV in South Pyongan Province. A flower basket was presented in Kim's name.Kim Jong Un said that although it has been 70 years since the war, the people of DPRK still remember the heroic achievements of the CPV in resisting U.S. aggression and selflessly supporting the DPRK under extremely difficult circumstances.He said that the country will never forget the CPV soldiers' noble spirit of selflessness as they risked their lives and made sacrifices to conquer invasion of the forces of imperialism.No matter how much time passes and generations change, the significance of the great victory achieved by the two countries in the war created a link between the military and the people that remains unchanged, the DPRK leader said.According to the KCNA, Kim also visited the Friendship Tower in Pyongyang on Wednesday, presenting a flower basket at the tower.The Friendship Tower was built on October 25, 1959 to commemorate the CPV sacrifice in the war.(Cover: The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Un pays tribute to martyrs of Chinese People's Volunteers(CPV) commemorating the 70th anniversary of the CPV army entering the DPRK in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. /CCTV)There are two weeks to go until election day in the United States, 30 million Americans have already voted and Donald Trump and Joe Biden have spent the past seven days on the campaign trail in the critical swing states that will decide who wins the race for the White House.Election 2020: How is a U.S. president elected?Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionHere's what you might have missed over the past week.Biden has a stable polling advantage over Trump, more than eight points nationally according to CGTN analysis and by slightly smaller margins in the battlegrounds, but while the Democrat's lead has been steady for weeks, his campaign is warning against complacency."The very searing truth is that Donald Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire," Biden's campaign manager cautioned in a memo to supporters on Saturday.Trump has intensified his schedule, addressing rallies across the country â including Nevada, which he only narrowly lost in 2016 â with mainly mask-less crowds sitting shoulder to shoulder even as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are on the rise in 48 of the 50 states and polls suggest a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the pandemic. The president encouraged "lock her up" chants towards Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer â the subject of a recent kidnapping plot â again insulted infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and engaged in Twitter spats with fellow Republicans up for reelection including Senator Ben Sasse, who in a call to his Nebraska constituents warned of a "Republican bloodbath in the Senate."There are doubts over whether rallies to existing supporters are the best use of resources for a campaign that is running far behind in fundraising: in September Biden and his affiliates raked in $383 million, a huge $135 million more than Trump's $248 million.Whereas Trump's rallies led to free media worth tens of millions of dollars in 2016, in this cycle â even though they continue to dominate local news in key areas and aid data collection â they generally only appear on national news in a negative light, reinforcing views of his handling of the pandemic or amplifying the kind of rhetoric which has turned off older voters and suburban women.Biden, whose running mate Kamala Harris was off the campaign trail for several days after a senior aide tested positive for COVID-19, also surprised many by winning the TV ratings war as the candidates took part in competing town hall events last week.But eyes now turn to the last presidential debate, with Trump already telling supporters that the moderator, NBC News' Kristen Welker, is "terrible and unfair" and the campaigns arguing over the topics due for discussion on Thursday evening.Trump is scheduled to continue his rallies through the week, while Biden is huddling down with advisers preparing for the final mass viewership event of the election â a debate where fireworks are expected, as the president tries to knock his challenger out of his comfort zone and the Democrat aims to keep things steady with the clocking ticking ever closer to November 3.Video: Wang Zengzheng and Zhou TingyuScript: John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.Editor's note: The story is part of our continuing World Factory series, which delves into the trajectory of China's economic growth amid a changing geopolitical landscape, the pandemic and a global economic recession. Here are the first, second and third stories. The trade war and the pandemic have fueled speculation about a potential wave of offshoring from China.But Trueanalog Strictly OEM, a high-end audio speaker factory based in Guangzhou, continues to operate in China. And it has no plans to leave, said Philip Richardson, the factory's American owner. The factory manufactures loudspeakers for the world's top speaker brands, e.g. Avantone, and most of its products are exported to Europe and the U.S. The facility employs around 20 workers and has found its niche, targeting the premium market segment â home stereo speakers or headphones with a price tag over $1,000. "I don't know a single American speaker factory that moved outside of China. This is where the greatest resources of parts are... right here," said Richardson. China dominates the production of raw materials required to make speakers, including magnet, copper, aluminum and low carbon steel, he added. The vertical integration of Chinese supply chains is a major reason why little production has gone offshore, according to Emily Jiang, purchasing manager of Triangle, a French high-end speaker manufacturer. Most parts are sourced from the Yangtze River Delta Region and the Pearl River Delta Region, and can be easily shipped to manufacturers. "It is so easy to procure parts that go into speakers domestically," she noted, "which is why we won't go to Southeast Asian countries where many still depend on China for the supply of parts." China has become the world's manufacturing powerhouse over the past two decades. In 2010, the value created in China by manufacturing surpassed the U.S., making it the largest manufacturer in the world, according to data from the World Bank. But China's labor-cost advantage is disappearing. Wages have gone up 15 to 20 percent per year, shrinking the total cost advantage of doing businesses in China. Amid the rising labor cost, some low-end manufacturing, like garment production, has moved to Southeast Asia. But what has made China a vital manufacturing hub is not just cheap labor, but a skilled workforce, especially in fields which involve intricate hand work. Speaker production is still a labor-intensive industry, according to Richardson. For example, a worker needs to install the wires on a loudspeaker coin, a task that is impossible for robots to handle, at least for now."It is in the DNA of Chinese workers to work hard and do a good job," said Richardson. Contrary to conventional belief that factories in China are stuffed by young laborers, many workers at Trueanalog are over the age of 30 and have been at the factory for more than five years. For Richardson, his workers are integral to the success of his businesses. At the factory, workers are allowed to take a 10-minute break every two hours, and follow a schedule of five days a week, eight hours per day. "This work schedule is rare in Chinese OEM factories," said a female worker on the production line, who is from landlocked Sichuan Province.The pandemic dealt a heavy blow to the global supply chain. Global manufacturing output declined in the second quarter by 11.2 percent in a year-over-year comparison, following a drop by six percent in the previous quarter, according to data from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. But China's manufacturing PMI has remained in expansion territory since February this year, and its exports have surged since June. Richardson's factory has been working around the clock to meet that surging demand. The pandemic has given him a boost since April, he said. Because consumers are spending more time at home, sales have gone up 30 percent for Trueanalog. China's total export of speakers also jumped in recent months, with the figures for July and August higher than in the same months last year, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. The pandemic, in a way, has highlighted countries' reliance on China for the supply chain. Some countries have tried to lure businesses back to their home countries in the post-pandemic world. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, has called for American companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but that does not seem to be happening "en masse." According to a survey done by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which included responses from 340 companies, 92 percent of them said they had no plans to move out of China, and only 5.1 percent of companies with global revenues over 500 million U.S. dollars planned to leave. "It is simply too expensive to manufacture in the U.S.," said Richardson. While it costs companies around $75 per hour to employ an American worker, it takes only $30 per day ($3.75 per hour) to hire a skilled Chinese worker in the speaker production industry. Even if companies ship the semi-products from China and assemble them in the U.S., it would still be too costly, he added. He was once approached by an American customer to make three-inch drivers in the U.S. But after doing a cost analysis, he realized that it would cost American manufacturers an additional $20 per speaker to assemble them in the U.S. "For people saying China is taking away jobs, noâ¦.It is simply a matter of economics," he noted. Writer: Yu Jing Videographer: Shen LanglangVideo editors: Amy Chen, Yu Jing Data editor: Hu YiweiCover image: Pan YufeiOn Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump nominated conservative federal appellate Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died from complications of pancreatic cancer earlier this month."She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution," Trump said of Barrett from the White House Rose Garden."This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation."The announcement came at a time when nearly six in 10 Americans say the president elected in November should be the one to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Meanwhile, 44 percent of respondents think the current court is "about right" in terms of ideological leanings, while 34 percent think it is too conservative and 22% too liberal, according to the same poll.If confirmed after Senate hearings in mid-October, Barrett would bring the number of conservative justices to six on the nine-member court â a dramatic turn to the right that could have far-reaching impact on the country's judicial and political development long after President Trump exits the White House.With the Republicans holding a 53-47 advantage in the Senate, Trump appears to have a clear path to having his third Supreme Court pick confirmed, after Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.What does a 6-3 court means?Trump's timely nomination has set off media speculation about unwinding decades of liberal progress on a wide range of issues from voting to abortion, and bringing American jurisprudence back decades.If Barrett joins, she would be the sixth Catholic on the bench and the fifth woman to do so in the court's 231-year history.Since the end of World War II, the U.S. Supreme Court has kept a balance of 5-4, with the majority being liberal or conservative. The intricate balance has kept the court from being one-sided, since one vote from the other camp could help tip the court's decision to its favor. However, a 6-3 bench could mean the conservatives can afford to lose one vote and still prevail.With a dominant majority and hence a more predictable outcome, the conservative camp â Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh with the addition of Amy Coney Barrett â will also be more emboldened to direct America's highest court to take on controversial cases which have been sidestepped in the past when the outcome was less clear with a 5-4 bench.Appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005, the generally conservative Chief Justice John G. Roberts has functioned as a swing vote on some key occasions, including siding with his liberal colleagues to uphold the Affordable Care Act in 2012. Now, the only three liberal justices would have to pursue Roberts plus another conservative Justice in order to come up on top in any decision. A 6-3 conservative bench would likely loosen restrictions on fire arms which many Republicans see as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Besides, the advancement of LGBT rights in recent decades would also likely experience significant challenges as religious rights expands. However, no issue is as divisive as abortion.As a candidate, Trump has promised to overturn Roe v. Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision which legalized abortion in the U.S. With a third Trump justice, it is likely that this campaign promise could materialize.Who is Barrett?During her nomination speech, Barrett praised the legacy left behind by Justice Ginsburg for having "smashed" the glass ceiling for women in the legal profession. However, carrying a proven conservative record voting record on a range of issues including gun rights and abortion, she will likely take the opposite end of the ideological spectrum as the woman she's set to replace."A judge must apply the law as written," she said. "Judges are not policy makers."The statement is an homage to the legal principle known as originalism which argues the constitution should be interpreted based on the original intent of the authors at the time it was ratified. This concept was evangelized by the giant of conservative jurisprudence, Justice Antonin Scalia whom Barrett clerked for from 1998 to 1999.While Scalia's approach to the constitution has sometimes led him to liberal conclusions, Barrett's legal opinions have been more influenced by her lifelong devotion to Catholicism.During her teaching career at Notre Dame, she often invoked God in articles and speeches, according to the Associated Press. In a 2006 address, she encouraged graduating law students to see their careers as a means to "building the kingdom of God."Barrett was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1972. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company and her mother a high school French teacher. She attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship and graduated with honors. She is also mom to seven children. Editor's note: THIS IS CHINA is an original animated series CGTN Digital presents for the Two Sessions. Each episode focuses on the most popular topics and trends in China, recounting how China's economy and society, guided by government policies, have evolved in the new era.  The key term in this episode: The Cashless Era.Spending a day without cash or bank cards is perfectly unremarkable in China.More than three-quarters of Chinese people were using digital payment in preference to cash by 2017 and the number has continued to rise. Eighty-six percent now use mobile payment, whether to pay utility bills, travel short or long distances, make appointments at hospital or go grocery shopping. The growth in use of digital payment has been supported by the development of advanced technologies. According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the number of 4G base stations in China totaled 5.44 million in 2019 â more than half of the world's total. With the innovation of the QR code, online and offline payments have been further combined.Read more:China's QR code industry to be worth multi-trillions of yuan by 2025Common Destiny: 'QR code planters' bring cashless payment to the worldMobile payment platforms WeChat Pay and Alipay have also contributed to the development of the cashless society in China.In recent years, Bluetooth payment, biometric payment, sonic payment, AR/VR payment and other emerging payment methods have been launched.Meanwhile, the number of 5G base stations in use nationwide has exceeded 200,000 according to the latest data from the MIIT, which means that China has hit the "fast-forward" button on the construction of Internet infrastructure.The proportion of 5G users in China is expected to increase to nearly 50 percent by 2025, and 5G commercialization will create more possibilities for the growth of the cashless era.Read more:5G Phones will outsell 4G by 2023China leads global race in key 5G patents: reportThe country's internet availability rate has increased by 3.8 percentage points year on year to 59.6 percent, according to the 43rd statistical report from the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), further laying the foundation for a high rate of online payment users.The central bank and other financial authorities have announced they want to spread the benefits of going cashless to the four out of 10 people in China who still live in rural areas. According to the central bank, 66.5 percent of people in rural areas were already using digital payments by 2017.Read more:China's mobile payment enters overseas marketsAlipay's worldwide users exceed 1 billionIn fact, mobile payment also helps the sharing economy, e-retailing, digital governance, education and healthcare as well as other emerging technologies, business fields and models, such as smart governance, smart hospitals, automated payment and other industrial applications.The merits and convenience of a cashless society are significant, but concerns over safety and privacy also need to be addressed. And the risk that a cashless society could marginalize older and less tech-savvy spenders and the less well-off also need to be considered.Read more:China's central bank regulates forced cashless payment Editor: Duan FengyuanCopy Editor: John GoodrichChief Editor: Chen RanSenior Consultant: Dr. Xia JixuanProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiAn Israeli delegation made a visit to Sudan on Wednesday to discuss normalizing ties, Israeli public broadcaster Kan radio said, as a minister predicted a possible diplomatic breakthrough between the two countries.Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Israel's media that he believed Israel was "very close to normalizing ties with Sudan."Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and the Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment when asked about prospects for a breakthrough with Sudan. In a foreign-policy flourish ahead of his re-election bid, top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump this week escorted Israeli delegates to Bahrain and UAE delegates to Israel, cementing Israel's new, U.S.-brokered relations with the Gulf states.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the United States had begun the process of removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and was also working "diligently" to get Khartoum to recognize Israel.Pompeo stopped short of saying Sudan's removal would be linked to whether it would agree to normalize relations with Israel. Sudanese sources have not indicated so far that normalization talks were far advanced.Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Ofir Akunis said that the United States would announce another deal establishing ties between Israel and an Arab or Muslim country before the U.S. election."I have a reasonable basis to believe that the announcement will come before November 3 â that, if you'll permit me, is what I understand from my sources," Akunis told Israel's Army Radio.Akunis said several countries were candidates to normalize relations with Israel. He did not name these, saying that it was "customary" to let the first official word come from Washington."More nations that are in the Arab League will normalize and make peace with Israel, I have no doubt, it is a certainty.

The vessels had previously been scheduled to work until October 22.NATO members Turkey and Greece are at odds over conflicting claims to hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean and overlapping views on the extent of their continental shelves. Tensions flared in August when Ankara sent Oruc Reis to waters also claimed by Greece and Cyprus.Ankara had withdrawn Oruc Reis last month to "allow for diplomacy" before a European Union summit at which Cyprus sought sanctions against Turkey, but sent it back this month, prompting an angry rebuke from Greece, France and Germany.After the summit, the bloc said it would punish Turkey if it continued its operations in the region, in a move Ankara said further strained Turkey-EU ties. Turkey says its operations are within its continental shelf.In recent weeks the war of words between Turkey, Greece and Cyprus has escalated to shows of military strength, with military drills taking place in the region.Earlier on Wednesday, Greece urged the EU to reconsider its customs union with Turkey in response to Ankara's exploration in the Mediterranean, deploring what it termed Turkey's "imperial fantasies."Turkey said on Wednesday it had extended the stay of its Oruc Reis survey vessel and two other ships in a disputed area of the eastern Mediterranean until October 27, in a move likely to further escalate tensions in the region.Two other vessels, the Ataman and Cengiz Han, along with Oruc Reis will continue working in an area southeast of the Greek island of Rhodes until October 27, Turkey's Navy said in a maritime notice.

Tony Evers' capacity order- limiting the number of people who can gather in bars, restaurants and indoor venues to 25 percent of capacity.

"With no single piece of evidence, they (Sweden) are just suppressing Chinese telecom companies under the excuse of [threatening] national security."They are politicizing normal economic activities, Zhao said.Stockholm announced the decision ahead of the spectrum auction scheduled for next month. According to the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS), the setting of the licence conditions followed assessments by the Swedish Armed Forces and security service, which has called China "one of the biggest threats against Sweden."The Swedish authorities gave companies in the auction a deadline of January 1, 2025 to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment from their existing infrastructure."The ban leaves network operators with less options and risks slowing the roll out of 5G in markets where competition is reduced," said Ben Wood, chief of research at leading research mobile communication company CCS Insight, as quoted by Reuters. Sweden-based telecommunications giant Ericsson, Huawei's biggest rival in 5G technology, may likely be one of the beneficiaries.British political and international relations analyst Tom Fowdy questioned the legitimacy of the move. Specifically, he pointed out that Swedish products have been widely valued and put in use in China, "one must question whether it is fair that Sweden is banning Huawei and ZTE. Is this the reciprocity on market access that Europe keeps asking for?""China is opening its markets, but as seen by the new entity list and export control laws, it is also equipping itself with tools to deal with countries that are not playing fairly," Fowdy wrote in a CGTN opinion piece.On Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm also rejected accusations that Huawei and ZTE posed threats to Sweden's national security."We urge the Swedish government to abide by the market principles of open development and fair competition, and reconsider the relevant decision," the embassy wrote on its website."We are resolutely opposed to abusing the concept of 'national security' and â¦ rejecting specific enterprises from specific countries," it added.Sweden's ban on two Chinese telecommunication companies, Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp., from its 5G networks on Tuesday has drawn strong opposition from Beijing."Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp. have been strictly abiding by local laws," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Wednesday.

Specifically, he pointed out that Swedish products have been widely valued and put in use in China, "one must question whether it is fair that Sweden is banning Huawei and ZTE. Is this the reciprocity on market access that Europe keeps asking for?""China is opening its markets, but as seen by the new entity list and export control laws, it is also equipping itself with tools to deal with countries that are not playing fairly," Fowdy wrote in a CGTN opinion piece.On Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm also rejected accusations that Huawei and ZTE posed threats to Sweden's national security."We urge the Swedish government to abide by the market principles of open development and fair competition, and reconsider the relevant decision," the embassy wrote on its website."We are resolutely opposed to abusing the concept of 'national security' and â¦ rejecting specific enterprises from specific countries," it added.China has never intended to challenge or replace anyone, Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, stressing what it cares most about is to improve the well-being of its own people.Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the remarks when responding to a new initiative revealed by the U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Tuesday which appealed to expand U.S. alliances with "like-minded democracies" and advance U.S. arms sales in order to counter Russia and China.Stressing that China expects a peaceful and stable world, Zhao said that China has always been committed to advancing the well-being of the Chinese people and realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.According to Zhao, viewing China as a rival is a serious strategic misjudgment that will lead to the U.S. investing its strategic resources in the wrong direction.It does not help the mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries, added Zhao, warning the move may also harm regional and global peace and stability.China's policy towards the U.S. is highly stable and consistent. China urges the U.S. politicians to discard their old Cold War mentality and zero-sum view and treat China's relations with U.S. and Russia with an objective and rational attitude, said Zhao.The spokesperson advised the two sides to meet each other halfway and drag the bilateral relations back to the right track.China has never intended to challenge or replace anyone, Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, stressing what it cares most about is to improve the well-being of its own people.Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the remarks when responding to a new initiative revealed by the U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Tuesday which appealed to expand U.S. alliances with "like-minded democracies" and advance U.S. arms sales in order to counter Russia and China.Stressing that China expects a peaceful and stable world, Zhao said that China has always been committed to advancing the well-being of the Chinese people and realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.According to Zhao, viewing China as a rival is a serious strategic misjudgment that will lead to the U.S. investing its strategic resources in the wrong direction.It does not help the mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries, added Zhao, warning the move may also harm regional and global peace and stability.China's policy towards the U.S. is highly stable and consistent.

These agencies must be able to develop, review, and disseminate public health data, guidelines, and other information that are based on science, facts, and medical principles â and not the political imperatives and moods of a president and his advisors," the letter said.The GOA will "determine whether this interference has violated the agencies' scientific integrity and communication policies," according to a press release from Warren's official website.The Trump administration has reportedly been pressuring staff at the health agency to change key CDC recommendations and allegedly interfered in publications of reports regarded as contradicting Trump's description of the pandemic as under control.(Cover: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the national public health institute of the U.S. /Reuters)An independent U.S. government watchdog will launch an investigation into whether the administration of President Donald Trump inappropriately intervened in the coronavirus work of the country's top public health agencies, USA Today reported.The newspaper reported that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a legislative agency that evaluates government work for Congress, agreed on Monday to assess Trump officials' political moves linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Charles Young, a spokesman for the GAO, told USA Today that "we expect the work will start in January, as staff who cover those issues become available."The paper said that the investigation was at the request of Senate Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren."The CDC and FDA's independence as scientific agencies is crucial to safeguarding the public health and saving lives.

His so-called forced labor claim and other issues are typical cases of fabrication, spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Tuesday in response to the U.S. Secretary of State, who criticized China over "forced labor" and religion restriction in Northwestern China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.Zhao said all laborers in Xinjiang, including ethnic minorities, are equally protected by China's labor laws, and they're free to choose their professions and locations of work. There is no restriction on them.Pompeo had made a statement on monitoring and combating trafficking in persons on the department's website, claiming that there are mass forced laborers in Xinjiang and that it is a part of China's campaign of repression against Uygurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in the region.In recent years, China has strengthened its efforts to fight against terrorism and poverty in Xinjiang. Under China's nationwide poverty alleviation project, tens of millions of Chinese have been lifted out of penury, including people in Xinjiang, which has a huge population living below the poverty line. Part of the project is relocation, meaning moving people from poor mountainous villages to places with abundant resources, like towns and cities, where companies supported by the government can help them land a job or start small businesses due to the centralization.Read more: Does 'forced Uygur labor' truly exist in China?Zorehan Metniyaz, a 35-year-old woman who used to feed her family by herding sheep in a village, began learning greenhouse vegetable growing skills in 2018 after moving to a relocation site in Xinjiang's Hotan Prefecture, where featured agricultural industries, like vegetable greenhouses, are supported by the local government. One year after the relocating, she made 35,000 yuan (roughly $5,242) â about five times more than before. After tasting the sweet, she rented another greenhouse to plant strawberries."For people who want to learn greenhouse skills, we would distribute greenhouses to them, but if they prefer to take a job in big cities, we would send them to Korla. There are factories, and they can first learn skills before becoming formal employees," Chen Pengfei, the party chief of the relocation site, explained. "Our basic job is like a bridge, introducing people to different positions based on their personal preferences."Read more: Trans-regional job offers help Xinjiang farmers shake off povertyThe same thing also occurs in other Chinese provinces. Taking Tibet as an example, to date, the construction of 965 relocation sites has been completed, and 266,000 people have settled into their new houses. Local officials said that their work now is not persuading people to move into new houses but to make sure there will be no conflict because some people who don't "meet the criterion but also want to move into a new house.""At the beginning of the relocation program, it was hard to persuade some elders, who hold deep affection to their homeland, to leave, and we had to put in a lot of work. For example, we invited them to see new buildings, scope out the location, layout and facilities around the residential complex. At last, they voluntarily moved into their new houses," according to Wu Yingjie, chief of the Communist Party of China in Tibet.In addition to their freedom, China said ethnic minorities' traditions, customs, religious beliefs and spoken and written languages are also lawfully protected."The employers provide good working and living conditions for employees of ethnic minorities and make sure all their needs are attended to. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region government takes proactive measures to safeguard to the maximum the right to work and employment of people from all ethnic groups based on their own will. How can anyone call this 'forced labor'? It's so preposterous," Zhao said at the daily news briefing.He criticized the U.S. for, on the one hand, claiming that they care about ethnic minorities in Xinjiang and other hand taking all sorts of measures to repress Xinjiang enterprises and impose unilateral sanctions and pressure, which will hinder and undermine the development and prosperity of Xinjiang.Zhao said the United States itself has a terrible record on human rights and religious freedom, with numerous scandals relating to racial discrimination, police brutality and prisoner abuse, while the gun-violence crime rate in the country has been the highest in the world for years, causing on average tens of thousands of deaths per year. The religious situation of ethnic minorities in the United States is also worrisome."The U.S. government should focus on handling its domestic problems rather than making up lies about others," Zhao said."Politicians like Pompeo can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but they cannot fool all the people all the time.

As of Tuesday, more than 4.6 million Texans have voted, according to the U.S. Elections Project.That's more than half of the ballots counted for the 2016 presidential election, Fox News reports.The state also saw a jump in voter registration this year. According to the Texas secretary of state, 17 million people became new voters in Texas. An increase of almost 2 million compared to 2016.On Monday, Florida broke its record for the opening day of early-voting. Considered a critical battleground state to watch in the election, at least 350,000 voters cast their ballots.Republicans had a slight lead in voter turnout for the first day of in-person voting in Florida.43% of Mondayâs voters were registered Republicans and 42% were registered Democrats, according to the Hill. Overall, voter turnout in Florida grew by almost 17% compared to the 2016 election.Georgia also saw a surge in early voting compared to 2016. Based off state data, with almost 1.7 million people voting, turnout jumped 142% in the first eight days compared to the same time four years ago.As millions of votes come in across the U.S., it's unclear how long it will take to count them all, which means a clear winner might not be decided by the end of the night on November 3rd.The process for receiving and counting votes also differs by state. Some have already received extensions for receiving and counting votes to accommodate for the pandemic. Mail-in ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day but they can be received and counted late in some states. For example in Washington State, mail-in ballots can be received until November 23rd. But in most states the deadline for receiving ballots is one to two days after the election.After votes are counted, states must certify their results, which typically takes about two weeks. But if a recount is needed, a stateâs deadline can be extended.Once the election results are certified, the electoral college begins its process of assigning electors and casting votes.In some states, officials are already counting votes but releasing the results prior to the election is against the law. National opinion polls show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the lead over incumbent President Donald Trump. Election experts warn even though voters are showing up in record numbers, opinion polls and voter turnout can't always guarantee a winner.Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

The coronavirus pandemic and severe flooding have added to its woes.Removal from the terrorism list â once Khartoum sets aside $335 million it agreed to pay to U.S. victims of militant attacks and their families â could help ease economic pain, partly by unlocking international financing and debt relief.Washington has offered Sudan development and humanitarian help, U.S. and Gulf-based sources said in September, after U.S. officials and military head General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan discussed the issue of Israel in September.But while the United States has been lobbying hard for Sudan to normalize ties with Israel just as it finalizes Khartoum's removal from the list, Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has argued the two issues should not be linked."It is not possible for an entire people to be forced to normalize in a week or two," acting Finance Minister Hiba Mohamed Ali told Sudanese TV on Monday."If it is our wish to normalize relations with Israel, we must give a suitable chance for the issue to be studied in detail."Despite apparent support from Burhan, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda in February, and his military deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who recently praised Israel's economic development, a rapid move to normalize ties could fracture the civilian coalition they share power with."Our view of the Zionist entity remained fixed â that it is a racist entity hostile to all national liberation movements," said Sadiq Farouk, a Communist Party leader from the coalition that backs the government.Hamdok has said he is not authorized to decide on ties with Israel. "With this position, Hamdok wants to avoid any decision that might lead to a split in the ruling coalition that supports the government," said Fath Alrahman Ahmed of Khartoum's Al-Neelain University.Recognizing Israel could also trigger a backlash from Islamist factions loyal to Bashir that have sought to discredit the transition.Still, people have been able to signal support for establishing ties publicly for the first time.A former member of parliament, Abulgasem Bartum, says he is planning a private trip with 40 Sudanese businesspersons, sportspeople and cultural figures to Israel as a confidence building measure next month.In Jerusalem, Zvi Hauser, chairman of the Israeli parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, told public broadcaster Kan Israel could help the region with science and technology and he hoped Sudan joined the "wave" of recognition.Some younger Sudanese, less wedded to the Palestinian cause than their parents or grandparents, say they could also back the move."I have no objection to Sudan having normal relations with Israel if this is in the interest of the country," said Ahmed Ibrahim, a 30-year-old telecommunications company employee."We want jobs, health, education and a better life ...

In March, ASPI issued a report claiming that at least 80,000 Uygurs were relocated to factories in Xinjiang as forced labors between 2017 to 2019 in order to control them.China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region refuted the claim. The spokesperson for the Information Office of Xinjiang, Elijan Anayit, noted that the APSI has long been receiving funds from the U.S. government and arm dealers. Anayit said it deliberately smears, vilifies and demonizes China for the investors' benefits.Ironically, the latest APAC report found out the reports published by ASPI were funded by weapon makers relying on prison labors in "a significant proportion."The APAC report also pointed out that despite its claims of producing independent research, ASPI is a Commonwealth-owned company, which has never publicly disclosed the full extent of millions of dollars in payments from the defense department, foreign governments and weapons manufacturers.While its anti-China propaganda has been attracting audience, the reports from ASPI have incurred condemnations from former foreign ministers, diplomats, defense personnel, Commonwealth public service chiefs and senior media commentators.The APAC News published a latest report revealing that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a defense and strategic policy think tank based in Canberra, Australia, has received millions of dollars of funding from corporations directly profiting from forced prison labor.APAC, a Sydney-based news outlet, found that at least 11 financial backers of ASPS "have either directly or indirectly been involved in prisons and the use of prison labor and/or implicated in human trafficking." Among them, four major long-term financial backers â BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon â have relied upon prison labor to build components used in their military hardware.This report compiled data from U.S. Bureau of Prisons, UNICOR, United States Department of Justice, Human Rights Watch, Wired, Reuters, The Guardian, Business Insider, Harvard Prison Divest Campaign, prisonlegalnews.org and Center for Research on Globalization, and mapped out the link between ASPI and the "prison industry."The ASPI has been reporting extensively on human right issues in China.

He described the visit as "a glorious day for peace."  "Today, we are making history in a way that will stand for generations," the right-wing premier said of the Israeli-UAE accord, which has been angrily denounced by the Palestinians.   The two states signed four agreements on Monday, including one "exempting our nationals from visas," Netanyahu announced, arguing that free movement of people would offer benefits to the Israeli and Emirati economies. Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, described Tuesday's UAE visit as "shameful." Speaking in Ramallah, in the Israel-occupied West Bank, he said it came amid Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank. "The bilateral agreements that were announced today and the delegations that come and go, all of that offers the occupation a strength to escalate its aggression and its crimes against the Palestinian people and increases its intransigence and arrogance," he said. In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, a spokesman for the Islamist group Hamas, said, "Such a visit will only encourage the occupation to pursue the gradual annexation of West Bank lands."The five-hour visit would be restricted to the airport near Tel Aviv due to coronavirus concerns, Israeli organizers said. (With input from agencies; Cover: CFP)Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed Monday to reciprocal visa-free travel, making Emirati citizens the first in the Arab world to be exempted from Israeli entry permits.   The deal was signed after the first-ever official delegation from the UAE landed in Israel for a day of talks following an agreement to normalize ties signed at the White House last month.   Wearing a mask, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greeted the UAE delegation at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.

Unlike Twitter, which banned political ads, Facebook is still running them, and Trump's and Biden's expenditures on this platform have hit $165 million since the beginning of the year.According to information available at the Facebook Ad Library, and analysed by CGTN Digital, between January 1 and October 17, Democratic candidate Joe Biden poured in $82.71 million and President Donald Trump $82.38 million into the platform.Since January this year, the Republican candidate has been spending on Facebook ads, but has now been surpassed by Biden. The Democrat started investing more heavily at the beginning of August, before being formally nominated by the party, and then intensified spending after the nomination. In the week between October 11 to 17 and the last 30 days (September 18 â October 17), Biden outran Trump in terms of expenditures on Facebook. In that week alone, the Democrat side spent $7.14 million and the Republicans another $4.51 million. Biden is certainly using part of the $383 million raised in September, a significant $135 million more than Trump's $248 million.Starting this month, the president has been spending less and less, which might be considered a strange move, as polls show voters are giving the lead to the Democrats, and increasing social media campaign could help bridge the gap with its specific targeting.Besides, his presidential campaign gained a reputation for running the strongest digital ad promotion in 2016, which might mean a new push before the seven-day ad ban on Facebook is implemented. The company decided in September to restrict new political ads in the week before the election and remove posts that convey misinformation about COVID-19 and voting as to avoid being used to sow chaos and spread misinformation before, during, and after the U.S. presidential election.

Armenia denied firing it.The ceasefire was agreed on Saturday after an earlier deal brokered by Russia failed to halt the deadliest clashes in the South Caucasus since the 1990s.So far, the main driver of diplomacy between the ex-Soviet enemies has been Russia. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev both told Russia's TASS news agency in separate interviews on Monday that they were ready to come to Moscow for talks.The failure to stop the fighting has raised fears of a humanitarian crisis, and put new strains on ties between Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan, and its NATO allies which want the conflict to end.Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway enclave of Azerbaijan that is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, said 729 of its military personnel and 36 civilians had been killed in fighting that began on September 27. Azerbaijan said 61 Azeri civilians had been killed and 282 wounded. It has not disclosed its military casualties.Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri forces were shelling their positions in northern and southern areas of the line of contact that divides them.They said Azeri forces had shelled civilian settlements including the town of Martuni and four villages - charges that were denied by Azerbaijan. They reported one civilian killed and one wounded in Martuni.The Azeri defense ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Agjebedin, Tovuz and Dashkesan regions far from the conflict zone â accusations denied by Armenia.The ministry also said Terter and Aghdam regions were under shelling. AzTV state television said one of its journalists was wounded in Terter.The Azeri prosecutor general's office said Armenia had targeted a pipeline in the Khizi district of Azerbaijan, more than 300 km (186 miles) from the conflict zone, on Sunday afternoon. The pipeline, which carries oil to Novorossiisk in Russia, was not damaged but some missile fragments fell about 250 meters (820 feet) away, it said.Dismissing the report, Armenian defense ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said: "It's a total lie.âA ceasefire brokered in Moscow earlier this month was aimed at letting the sides swap detainees and bodies of those killed, but it had little impact on the fighting.The new ceasefire was announced on Saturday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov talked to the Armenian and Azeri foreign ministers by telephone.A new ceasefire in the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh was in jeopardy on Monday with Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces reporting shelling and heavy fighting.Among accusations on both sides, Azerbaijan said it had "neutralized" a missile fired by Armenian forces at an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan on Sunday, several hours after the ceasefire went into force.

into the most strict "Tier Three" lockdown. This would force pubs and bars that aren't serving food to close. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has refused to implement the measures, calling the government's assessment "exaggerated."One UK minister said "extra resources" had been offered to the Greater Manchester area amid concerns about protecting jobs and suggested a deal could be close. Burnham, though, says "nothing's changed."Ministers say they want a deal by Tuesday at the latest, to avoid a lockdown being imposed â against the wishes of city authorities.Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to avoid a national lockdown in England, preferring a more targeted approach to restrictions, which he hopes will limit economic damage as the UK â like much of Europe â suffers a second wave of the coronavirus this fall.The UK's devolved nations have opted for blanket restrictions. Northern Ireland's schools started a two-week closure from Monday, as part of new measures that began on Friday evening. Wales, is expected to announce a two-week "circuit-breaker" lockdown on Monday. Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamPolice have revealed there have been multiple incidents involving young people hosting parties in hotels after bars and restaurants were shut across the Netherlands on Thursday.Hotels are still open and many are offering rooms at cheap prices, with young people using them to break COVID-19 rules and throw parties.There has also been further controversy after King Willem-Alexander flew to Greece on holiday just hours after the new measures were announced. He returned to the country just one day later after his actions were widely condemned across the country."We can see people's reactions to media reports. And they are fierce, and they affect us," wrote the Dutch royal family in a statement. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he knew the king would leave, but he didn't realize it would send out the wrong message. The Dutch PM is politically responsible for all actions by the king and will now have to face tough questions from Parliament.Over the past seven days, there was an average of 7,661 positive tests per day in the Netherlands, compared with 5,537 a week earlier â an increase of 40 percent. Ross Cullen in ParisMore than 60,000 new infections were recorded this weekend in France, as cases of COVID-19 continue to rise.

This would force pubs and bars that aren't serving food to close. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has refused to implement the measures, calling the government's assessment "exaggerated."One UK minister said "extra resources" had been offered to the Greater Manchester area amid concerns about protecting jobs and suggested a deal could be close. Burnham, though, says "nothing's changed."Ministers say they want a deal by Tuesday at the latest, to avoid a lockdown being imposed â against the wishes of city authorities.Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to avoid a national lockdown in England, preferring a more targeted approach to restrictions, which he hopes will limit economic damage as the UK â like much of Europe â suffers a second wave of the coronavirus this fall.The UK's devolved nations have opted for blanket restrictions. Northern Ireland's schools started a two-week closure from Monday, as part of new measures that began on Friday evening.

And they are fierce, and they affect us," wrote the Dutch royal family in a statement. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he knew the king would leave, but he didn't realize it would send out the wrong message.

To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40 percent of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.Arce, a former economy minister regarded as the leftist heir to former leader Evo Morales, sounded confident of victory without explicitly claiming the win at his own news conference shortly after midnight in the Bolivian capital La Paz."Very grateful for the support and trust of the Bolivian people," Arce posted on Twitter early Monday after the exit poll results were published. "We have recovered democracy, and we will regain stability and social peace."The official count, which could take days, was less than 8 percent completed by 2:00 a.m. (0600 GMT). The usual rapid count had been abandoned after allegations of irregularities last year that led to Morales' November 2019 resignation after 14 years in power.Interim president Jeanine Anez, who was not a candidate, congratulated Arce and his running mate David Choquehuanca on their apparent win."We still do not have an official count, but from the data we have, Mr Arce and Mr Choquehuanca have won the election.

Many touted signs and rainbow colored homemade banners calling for a "yes" vote next Sunday in a referendum over whether to scrap the country's constitution, which was adopted in 1980 during the regime of General Augusto Pinochet.The morning brought a largely festive atmosphere to the protests at Plaza Italia. Many showed up wearing masks to protect against the coronavirus pandemic, held up banners, sang and danced. Police even gradually pulled back from the Plaza Italia."It's great, very good and positive. They're pure good things for Chile in everything from here," demonstrator Viviana Donoso, 43, told AFP as she and a group of people danced to drums."The people of Chile need to unite, and we have to believe that we can do things."Some even turned up to the demonstration in fancy dress. Demonstrators also called for their countrymen to vote to "approve" the proposed constitutional change, a key demand of the 2019 protests."This is the opportunity to say enough! We're here and we're going to vote for 'Approve,'" Paulina Villarroel, a 29-year-old psychologist, told AFP.Police estimated that Sunday's rally in Santiago attracted around 25,000 people by 6 p.m., far smaller than the largest protests of 2019.The demonstrations, while largely peaceful early on, were marred by increasing incidents of violence, looting of supermarkets and clashes with police across the capital later in the day. Fire truck sirens, burning barricades on roadways and fireworks on downtown streets added to a sense of chaos in some neighborhoods.Interior Minister Victor Perez spoke late in the evening, praising the early, peaceful rallies while blasting the late-night mayhem. He called on Chileans to settle their differences by voting in the upcoming constitutional referendum."Those who carry out these acts of violence do not want Chileans to solve our problems through democratic means," Perez told reporters, vowing to punish those who crossed the line Sunday.Early in the day, an angry mob jeered and threatened a Communist Party mayor. Later, masked individuals firebombed a police headquarters and church. Vandals attacked another Santiago church in the early evening, setting its spire aflame and choking side streets with smoke.More than 15 metro stations were temporarily closed amid the unrest. Police fired tear gas and water cannons in skirmishes with sometimes violent, hooded and masked people.Last year's protests, which began October 18, raged until mid-December as Chileans gathered nationwide to call for reforms to the pension, healthcare and education systems. Rioting and looting resulted in billions of dollars in damage and losses to the country's businesses and infrastructure. The unrest saw the military take to the streets for the first time since the rule of Augusto Pinochet.In the past few days, small-scale demonstrations and isolated incidents of violence have nonetheless resurfaced in Chile, as the capital's six million citizens emerge from months of confinement following the COVID-19 pandemic.Most demonstrators on Sunday wore masks, but many could be seen in tight groups, raising concerns about a potential health risk.(With input from agencies)Tens of thousands of Chileans gathered in the central square of Santiago to mark the one-year anniversary of mass protests that left over 30 dead and thousands injured, with peaceful rallies on Sunday devolving by nightfall into riots and looting.People gathered early in the day in demonstrations downtown and in cities throughout Chile that gained size and fervor through the evening.

Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory," the embassy said.China and the Pacific island country established diplomatic relations in 1975.According to official Chinese data, the bilateral trade reached over $482 million in 2018, representing a 26-percent increase from the year before.China highly appreciates the Fijian government for upholding the one-China principle and expects that the Fijian side will tackle this issue properly, the embassy said.Foreign Ministry: Taiwan is playing the trick of a thief crying 'stop thief'The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday said Taiwan is playing the trick of a thief crying "stop thief," and stressed that any attempt to use the Taiwan issue to provoke ties between China and Pacific island countries will not succeed.There is no "diplomatic relationship" between Taiwan and Fiji, said spokesperson Zhao Lijian. The Fijian government has always adhered to the one-China principle, and it urged Taiwan's business institution to stop creating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" in 2019, which China highly appreciates, he said.Zhao reiterated that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.A Chinese diplomat in Fiji was injured earlier this month after a Taipei Trade Office employee provoked embassy staff at a local hotel, the Chinese Embassy in Fiji said on Monday.The Taipei Trade Office in Fiji held a so-called National Day event at the Grand Pacific Hotel in Suva on October 8, a move that violates the one-China principle as it sought to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" internationally, the embassy said in a statement.The staff from the trade office "acted provocatively against the Chinese Embassy staff who were carrying out their official duties in the public area outside the function venue, causing damage and injuries to one Chinese diplomat," it said."We have expressed our serious concerns to the Fijian side about the above incidents, requesting the Police Force of Fiji to carry out thorough investigation into the incidents and hold the perpetrators accountable according to law."Earlier, a Reuters report said two Chinese diplomats attacked an official from the Taipei office who ended up in the hospital."There is only one China in the world, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China.

The record-shattering figure is being driven in part by concerns about crowds at polling sites on Election Day amid the coronavirus pandemic.In North Carolina, a battleground where 1.4 million, or 20 percent, of the state's registered voters, had already voted as of Sunday morning, Biden urged residents to cast ballots as soon as possible. "We gotta keep the incredible momentum going; we can't let up," he said at a "drive-in rally" in Durham, as attendees sitting in their cars honked in approval. "Don't wait - go vote today."Biden also criticized Trump for saying over the weekend that the U.S. had "turned the corner" in the coronavirus pandemic, noting that the rate of new cases across the country has risen to the highest level in months."As my grandfather would say, 'This guy's gone around the bend if he thinks we've turned the corner,'" Biden said. "Things are getting worse, and he continues to lie to us about circumstances."Biden's pick for vice president, Senator Kamala Harris, canceled in-person events over the weekend as a precaution after an aide tested positive for COVID-19. She will return to the campaign trail on Monday with a visit to Florida to mark that state's first day of early in-person voting.Harris tested negative for the virus on Sunday, the campaign said.Trump, a Republican, was spending his Sunday in Nevada, a state he hopes to wrest away from Democrats after narrowly losing it in 2016. Early in-person voting in the state began on Saturday.The president, who rarely goes to church but has remained popular among evangelical Christians for his opposition to abortion and for appointing conservative judges, began his day by attending a service at the International Church of Las Vegas.Trump, who recently came down with his own bout of COVID-19, did not wear a mask for the indoor service.One of the church's pastors, Denise Goulet, said to Trump from the stage that God had told her he would win the 2020 election. Trump put a handful of 20 dollars bills into an offering bucket and bowed his head during a prayer.Trump will campaign every day leading up to Thursday's debate in Florida, including stops in Arizona and North Carolina, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.While Trump lags in opinion polls at a national level and in many battleground states, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said over the weekend that the national figures are misleading because must-win states are close."We cannot become complacent because the very searing truth is that Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire," she wrote in a memo to donors.U.S. presidential elections are determined by electoral votes, allotted to U.S. states and territories based largely on their populations, rather than by a tally of the popular vote nationwide.Trump campaigned on Saturday in Michigan and Wisconsin, two battleground states he narrowly won in the 2016 election.In Muskegeon, Mich., he attacked Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, for imposing restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus and made light of a right-wing plot uncovered by the FBI to kidnap her."Hopefully you'll be sending her packing pretty soon," Trump said, prompting the crowd to yell back "Lock her up!" several times.Whitmer said on Sunday's "Meet the Press" on NBC that the president's rhetoric was "incredibly disturbing" and "dangerous" for her and her family as well as other politicians whom he targets.(With input from Reuters and AFP)President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden were courting early voters on Sunday in the competitive states of Nevada and North Carolina, as the final presidential debate looms later this week.Both men are working to rouse their political bases and appeal to the seemingly small number of undecided voters in an election that could revolve around voter turnout.One key opportunity comes this week with the candidates' final nationally televised debate, on Thursday evening in Nashville, Tennessee.Some 27.7 million Americans have already cast ballots either by mail or in-person ahead of the November 3 election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.

Similarly, Republican George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000, but the Democrat still lost the election. And Trump could earn a second term as president even if Biden wins the most votes across the country.In a certain sense, the national vote is irrelevant in U.S. presidential elections â all that matters is the Electoral College.How does the Electoral College work?The Electoral College essentially creates 51 mini-elections, with individual contests in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). A total of 538 Electoral College votes (EVs) are split between the states and DC. The EVs are weighted by population and mirror the spread of seats in Congress: 435 representatives, 100 senators plus an additional three votes for DC equals 538.For example, California, the most populous U.S. state, has 53 representatives and two senators â equaling 55 electoral votes. Wyoming, the least populous state, has just one representative and two senators â and so three electoral votes.In all states bar Maine and Nebraska â which award two EVs to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district â the statewide winner takes all the votes.To win the presidency, a candidate must win enough states to pass the magic number of 270 â a majority of EVs.Why are the swing states critical?Strategizing where to campaign â and spend money on advertising and organizing â is vital to reaching 270. Recent history suggests around 37 states plus DC are firmly committed or lean heavily to one party or the other.It's safe to assume, for example, that California's 55 votes will go to Biden, and Wyoming's three will stick with Trump. Overall, there are around 17 states plus DC reliably in the Democratic column and 20 in the Republican column.By this measure, Biden effectively starts the election on 212 votes and Trump on 115. So where can the Democrat win the 58 votes he needs, and where can the Republican find 155?The key to every U.S. presidential election lies in the swing states, the battlegrounds which either party has a chance of winning. These are the states where the candidates will spend heavily on advertising and â pandemic allowing â make numerous campaign visits. In 2020, the key states to watch are Florida (29 EVs), Pennsylvania (20 EVs), North Carolina (15 EVs), Michigan (16 EVs), Wisconsin (10 EVs), and Arizona (11 EVs) though in such an unpredictable year others, such as Minnesota (10 EVs), Georgia (16 EVs) and Texas (38 EVs), could also come into play.How are Biden and Trump aiming to win?A starting point for determining the battlegrounds is to assess the margins of victory in 2016: Trump triumphed over Clinton with victories of less than one percentage point in the Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Those 46 Electoral College votes, won by the narrowest of margins in Midwestern states which hadn't voted Republican in decades, put the Republican in the White House.The president can afford to lose two of the Blue Wall states in 2020 and still narrowly win the Electoral College â so long as he holds on to all the others, he took in 2016 when he won states reflecting 306 Electoral College votes in total.The first and most obvious route to President Biden is for him to hold the states Clinton took in the last election and flip back Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin â that would give him 278, putting him in the White House even if he loses vote-heavy states like Florida.The Trump campaign initially looked to expand its target states to those won narrowly by Clinton in 2016, such as New Hampshire (4 EVs), Minnesota and Nevada (6 EVs) but has since changed strategy to focus on holding Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina.Biden, with a big cash advantage over Trump, could have a unique opportunity in 2020 to make inroads into traditional Republican bastions like Georgia and Texas.How is the winner decided?The winner of the presidency is the candidate with at least 270 EVs, but the process by which the state results are decided could be particularly contentious in 2020, with both parties fielding armies of lawyers in the swing states and rows over ballots likely.The EVs are really votes for individual electors, people chosen by the parties in each state to vote for either Trump or Biden on its behalf. This can create confusion, as constitutionally electors don't have to follow the states' popular votes â as several didn't in 2016 â though most are now compelled to do so by state law..While the winner of the election is traditionally projected on election night, the situation in 2020 is unique â at least half of the votes may be cast by mail or early, a huge increase on past elections â and so unless there is a decisive winner, the final result may not be known for days or weeks after November 3.The official timeline is an afterthought in most years but could be important in this cycle.The 538 electors must cast their votes by December 14, and the electoral votes must be passed to the president of the Senate by December 23. The votes are then passed to the new Congress, which meets in a joint session to count the votes on January 6 before inauguration day on January 20.What happens if there's a tie?The Electoral College system does leave open the potential for a 269-269 tie â in that scenario, the president would be decided by the state delegations in the House of Representatives.Each state would have one vote, irrelevant of their size or number of representatives, so 26 would be the number to hit.Ahead of the 2020 elections, the Republicans marginally control the most state delegations despite the Democrats holding a majority of representatives because smaller states like Wyoming, Alaska, and Montana that have just one representative are in the Republican's hands.In the event of a tie, the vice president would be elected by the Senate via majority vote.Video by Xu Qianyun, Ma Zhiyuan, Zhou Jinxi and Chen HaominScript by John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.The clock is ticking towards election day in the United States, with the eyes of the world on the battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden for the keys to the White House.The winner of the November 3 contest is decided via a system designed to give all 50 states a say, but it can have a curious outcome: the candidate with the most votes doesn't necessarily become president.Democrat Hillary Clinton won three million more votes than Trump in 2016, for example, but she's not in the White House.

He has controversially received the open backing of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Akinci's relationship with Ankara, on the other hand, has come under strain, especially after he described the prospect of the north's annexation by Turkey as "horrible" in February.Turkey has now engaged in a bitter dispute over oil and gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, partly because its claim over the marine resource around TRNC's territory isn't recognized by Greece and Cyprus. Sunday's second-round ballot was triggered after Tatar won 32 percent of the vote on October 11 ahead of Akinci, who garnered almost 30 percent in a field of 11 candidates.But Akinci is in a stronger position in the second round, having won the backing of Tufan Erhurman, a fellow Social Democrat, who came third last time around."The results of the first round tell us this: half of the Turkish Cypriot community defend a federation despite all kinds of pressure," Umut Bozkurt, vice dean and assistant professor at Eastern Mediterranean University, told AFP."This election was dominated more by Turkey-northern Cyprus relations than the Cyprus issue."The first round's results also show that a significant part of the electorate seek to be free of "pressure" from Ankara and to live in a united Cyprus, she added.Don't want to be puppetsIn the days leading up to the vote, Turkish Cypriot Twitter users used the hashtag #BarisCunku, meaning "Peace because" in Turkish.One user calling himself Ahmet Karaca wrote on Thursday, "#PeaceBecause, we don't want to be puppets in our own country, we want to be the actor, the director."When Akinci took office in 2015, he was hailed as the leader best placed to revive peace talks with the Republic of Cyprus.But hopes were dashed in July 2017 after UN-mediated negotiations collapsed in Switzerland, notably over the question of the withdrawal of tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers stationed in the TRNC.The polls come amid an economic crisis, deepened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has largely shuttered the tourism sector and led to the closure of Ercan airport in the north and crossing points to the south.The vote also comes after Turkey on Monday resumed gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, stoking tensions with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus in the south.The European Union has deplored Turkey's deployment of exploration vessels and warned Ankara against further "provocations" while multiple countries have staged military drills in the region in recent months.Earlier in October, Turkish troops angered the Republic of Cyrus and many Turkish Cypriots by reopening public access to the fenced-off disputed seaside town of Varosha for the first time since Turkish forces invaded the north.That move drew EU and UN criticism and sparked demonstrations in the Republic of Cyprus, which exercises its authority over the island's southern two-thirds, separated from the north by a UN-patrolled buffer zone.Turkey has repeatedly said it seeks to defend Turkish and Turkish Cypriots' rights in the eastern Mediterranean against a cabal of nations including Greece and Cyprus.(With input from AFP)Turkish-held northern Cyprus, a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara, votes Sunday for a new leader in a run-off election held amid heightened tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.The presidential vote pits the incumbent and favorite, Mustafa Akinci, 72 â who supports reunification with the majority Greek-speaking EU member the Republic of Cyprus in the south â against the right-wing Turkish nationalist Ersin Tatar.Tatar, 60, who advocates a two-state solution, now holds the title of "prime minister" in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).

There are over 7.3 million Bolivians eligible to vote on Sunday to pick up for new president, vice president, senators, deputies, and others for the period of 2020-2025."They are been expected in the election points where they will be safe. These (election) packages are going to be received in those points, logged and guarded," said Luis Vilca, an official for the Bolivian Electoral Tribunal. The leading contenders for the presidency are former Economy Minister Luis Arce and former President Carlos Mesa, a centrist historian and journalist. To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40 percent of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.The electoral tribunal announced on Saturday that the upcoming elections will be monitored by 213,600 citizen observers. Special election observation missions are also expected from a dozen international organizations, such as the EU, the Organization of American States and the UN, as well as several Bolivian civic organizations. In the days leading up to the vote several international observers had arrived in the Bolivian capital to ensure the execution of fair elections.The vote will be key to the direction of the landlocked country after a ballot last year prompted ousted President Evo Morales' resignation and plunged the Andean country into turmoil. However, it is reported that Bolivians in wealthier areas of the capital city of La Paz have begun stocking up on essential supplies and queuing up to buy gas ahead of the election, fearing a return of deadly clashes.The incumbent president Anez took office in November 2019 after the long-term leftist leader Evo Morales resigned the presidency and went into exile when police and army withdrew their support of him. Anez then announced her job as interim president would be to convoke elections to replace Morales. On that November, Bolivia had seen weeks of protests and turmoil where people claimed fraud over the reelection of Morales, who governed for nearly 14 years.While Morales was barred to participate into the elections for the presidency or the senate followed his ouster, he chose Arce as his stand-in for the Movement To Socialism party. The party's backing depends heavily on working-class and rural voters who remain loyal to Morales.(With input from agencies)Bolivia's electoral authorities on Saturday started delivering the sealed ballots ahead of Sunday's presidential election that will end the interim mandate of President Jeanine Anez.Ballots in Bolivia were guarded by police and army officers, who will remain with the electoral material until Sunday. There are over 7.3 million Bolivians eligible to vote on Sunday to pick up for new president, vice president, senators, deputies, and others for the period of 2020-2025."They are been expected in the election points where they will be safe. These (election) packages are going to be received in those points, logged and guarded," said Luis Vilca, an official for the Bolivian Electoral Tribunal. The leading contenders for the presidency are former Economy Minister Luis Arce and former President Carlos Mesa, a centrist historian and journalist. To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40 percent of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.The electoral tribunal announced on Saturday that the upcoming elections will be monitored by 213,600 citizen observers. Special election observation missions are also expected from a dozen international organizations, such as the EU, the Organization of American States and the UN, as well as several Bolivian civic organizations. In the days leading up to the vote several international observers had arrived in the Bolivian capital to ensure the execution of fair elections.The vote will be key to the direction of the landlocked country after a ballot last year prompted ousted President Evo Morales' resignation and plunged the Andean country into turmoil. However, it is reported that Bolivians in wealthier areas of the capital city of La Paz have begun stocking up on essential supplies and queuing up to buy gas ahead of the election, fearing a return of deadly clashes.The incumbent president Anez took office in November 2019 after the long-term leftist leader Evo Morales resigned the presidency and went into exile when police and army withdrew their support of him. Anez then announced her job as interim president would be to convoke elections to replace Morales.

Period," she said."Vote for your daughter's future," read one message in the sea of signs carried by demonstrators. "Fight like a girl," said another.In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demonstrations were considerably smaller, though protesters still turned out in cities across the country, according to organizers.More than 100,000 people took part in some 430 marches in locations from New York to Los Angeles and Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, organizers said.They urged people worried about in-person participation to join in a "socially distant text-banking telethon" aimed at sending five million messages encouraging people to vote.Marchers also paid tribute to late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg â an icon for women and progressives â while protesting Trump's choice of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace her.Barrett has made no secret of her strong Catholic beliefs, raising concerns that a Supreme Court dominated by conservatives could overturn abortion rights if she is confirmed by the Senate.Trump and his fellow Republicans are seeking to fast-track her nomination before the election, a process that began this week and which has drawn sharp controversy.The protest route in Washington started near the White House before heading to the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court building, where a smaller "I'm With Her" counterprotest â in Barrett's favor â was held.Most marchers in Washington wore face masks to stem the spread of COVID-19, with some dressed as Ginsburg in black robes with white lace collars, and many wore the knitted pink hats made famous by the original march.A number of protesters dressed in red robes and white bonnets, portraying characters forced to bear children in the dystopian novel and television series "The Handmaid's Tale."Signs and banners underscored the broader anti-Trump message: "Trump/Pence: Out Now," read one, while others simply said, "Dump Trump."In New York, around 300 people gathered at Manhattan's Washington Square, many with pink hats and signs supporting Trump's Democratic opponent Joe Biden or honoring Ginsburg. It was one of five separate marches in the city."It's really important to be here and try to encourage people to vote out Trump and his misogynistic policies, especially now, with COVID, when a lot of people are isolated," said Yvonne Shackleton, a 47-year-old working mother from near Albany, about a three-hour drive from New York City.A similar number of people gathered in Brooklyn, Ginsburg's hometown, with one protester's sign reading: "Ruth Sent Us.""I'm out here because it's so important that people vote and I'm telling people to vote blue for Biden and (running mate Kamala) Harris because Trump has been a disaster for our country," said Wendy Sacks, a 67-year-old vintage jewelry seller.Mask-wearing protesters marched in Chicago with the same message, banging drums and chanting for Trump's defeat.Next month's presidential contest was also the focus of a separate New York protest Saturday in which hundreds of demonstrators protested the killings of Black people by police officers.Among those protesting was Tamika Palmer, the mother of Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker killed by officers in March during a raid at her home in Louisville, Kentucky.A grand jury decided last month not to charge any of the police officers involved with her death; instead, one officer was charged with shooting into a neighboring home."People need to get out and vote," Palmer told those at the event.

This is the first time the annual exercise, typically concentrated in the Delta region, will be nationwide, Musa said.The move comes just days after the army said it was ready to step in and restore order, but Musa said in the statement that the exercise "has no relationship with any lawful protest under any guise whatsoever."The army had issued a statement on Wednesday warning what it termed "subversive elements and trouble makers" that it was "ready to fully support the civil authority in whatever capacity to maintain law and order and deal with any situation decisively."The mammoth protests saw people flood to the streets of the biggest city Lagos on Saturday, demanding an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police unit and pressing for reforms and accountability.Musa said the army enjoins all law abiding Nigerians to go about their lawful activities unhindered as the exercise has nothing to do with #EndSars protest, but the yearly event will ensure the safety and security of Nigeria and her citizens.Anger over abuses by SARS erupted into widespread demonstrations last week, forcing the government to scrap the unit. Protesters used Twitter and the #EndSars hashtag to spread photos and videos showing alleged police brutality.Nigeria's authorities have set up a new special weapons and tactics (SWAT) unit to replace SARS and pledged to hold officers who have committed abuses accountable.

Iran's Foreign Ministry has declared it as victory of "multilateralism, peace and security," despite Washington's pressure to reimpose sanctions.The arms embargo ends as part of Resolution 2231 of a landmark 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States, which gave Iran relief on sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.It means Iran will be legally able to both buy and sell conventional arms, including small arms, missiles, helicopters and tanks."As of today, all restrictions on the transfer of arms, related activities and financial services to and from The Islamic Republic of Iran, and all prohibitions regarding the entry or transit through territories of the United Nations Member States previously imposed on a number of Iranian citizens and military officials, are all automatically terminated," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said said in a statement on October 18.No special action was necessary from the Iranian side as the embargo lifts automatically if no extension or additional measures are taken by the Security Council, the statement said.Iran also said it was self-reliant in its defense and had no need to go on a weapons buying spree."Iran's defense doctrine is premised on strong reliance on its people and indigenous capabilities ... Unconventional arms, weapons of mass destruction and a buying spree of conventional arms have no place in Iran's defense doctrine," said in the statement.Tehran has made strides in ramping up its local production of conventional weapons and defensive capabilities under the pressure of multilateral sanctions over the past decades.Authorities have said Iran will be ready to sell arms when the embargo ends.In late August, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said it would be a "good idea" to consider purchasing missiles from Iran after rival Colombia said Maduro was looking into this plan.Although Tehran tends to exaggerate its weapons capabilities, concerns remain about its long-range ballistic missile program which contributed to Washington leaving the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.Tensions concerning arms control between Washington and Tehran have soared ever since.Related readings:Timeline: Is the landmark Iran nuclear deal coming to an end?From coup to Soleimani's assassination: Seven decades of US-Iran relations in picturesIn August this year, the Trump administration triggered a process aimed at restoring all UN sanctions, after the UN Security Council rejected a U.S. bid to extend the conventional arms embargo on the country.A month later, the U.S. unilaterally announced reinstating all UN sanctions on Iran that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal, a move which would automatically extend the arms embargo as well.The overwhelming majority of UNSC members rejected the bid, saying it has no legal basis. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also told the council he would not take any action on the U.S. declaration.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned it will have a "decisive response" if the U.S. tries to "bully" other nations into adhering to its reinstatement of sanctions.Last week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said during a news conference in Tehran the arms embargo will end on October 18 despite U.S. efforts to block it.However, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, together known as the E3, wrote a joint statement in July, saying that while E3 will remain committed to fully implement Resolution 2231 of the nuclear deal, they believe lifting of the arms embargo "would have major implications for regional security and stability.""We recall that the EU embargoes on conventional arms exports and missile technology will remain in force until 2023," they said.(With input from agencies)The international conventional arms embargo on Iran, imposed 13 years ago by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), was due to expire on Sunday.

According to the Azeri authorities, 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on September 27, but no military casualties have been released so far.In a televised address to the nation, Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, denounced the missile strike as a war crime and warned the leadership of Armenia that it would face responsibility."Azerbaijan will give its response and it will do so exclusively on the battlefield," Aliyev said.The Armenian Defense Ministry denied launching the Saturday strike, but the separatist officials in Nagorno-Karabakh put out a statement listing alleged "legitimate" military facilities in the city of Ganja, although they stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, came under intense shelling on Saturday, leaving three civilians wounded, according to the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities.The Azerbaijani military declared Saturday that they downed an Armenian Su-25 jet, a claim quickly dismissed by Armenia's Defense Ministry. Drones and rocket systems supplied by Turkey have given the Azerbaijani military an edge on the battlefield, helping them outgun the Armenian forces that rely mostly on outdated Soviet-era weapons.The Armenian military said they downed three Azerbaijani drones over the territory of Armenia on Saturday. Azerbaijan denied that.Armenia speaks to Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh's behalf as Baku refuses to negotiate with the separatist authorities. Yerevan says its own forces are not involved in the conflict and have not attacked Azerbaijan.

According to the Azeri authorities, 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on September 27, but no military casualties have been released so far.In a televised address to the nation, Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, denounced the missile strike as a war crime and warned the leadership of Armenia that it would face responsibility."Azerbaijan will give its response and it will do so exclusively on the battlefield," Aliyev said.The Armenian Defense Ministry denied launching the Saturday strike, but the separatist officials in Nagorno-Karabakh put out a statement listing alleged "legitimate" military facilities in the city of Ganja, although they stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, came under intense shelling on Saturday, leaving three civilians wounded, according to the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities.The Azerbaijani military declared Saturday that they downed an Armenian Su-25 jet, a claim quickly dismissed by Armenia's Defense Ministry. Drones and rocket systems supplied by Turkey have given the Azerbaijani military an edge on the battlefield, helping them outgun the Armenian forces that rely mostly on outdated Soviet-era weapons.The Armenian military said they downed three Azerbaijani drones over the territory of Armenia on Saturday.

It will go into effect on June 1, 2021.According to experts, the current existing law faces severe challenges due to the emergence of fresh social problems. For example, in some cases, the minors' guardians themselves are the domestic violence abusers; school bullying is frequent but often covered; numerous minors are addicted to online games and sexual abuses against minors are often conducted by people in close contact with the victims, like teachers, neighbors and relatives.As a response to theose problems, the revised law has formulated and improved related protective measures, clearly stipulated the responsibilities of parents, schools, society, government and judicial organs in safeguarding the well-being of minors.In terms of internet use by minors, the law highlighted that producers and sellers of network products should install online software for protecting minors or offer a clear information on how to install such a software.And they should also remind minors to protect their personal information and impose protective restrictions on minors' use of their personal information online. Without the consent of parents or other guardians, they're forbidden to collect, store and use minors' personal information.Besides, the new law urges schools to establish a mechanism to prevent school bullying, and provide training for faculties, staff and students in stopping school bullying. Schools and parents are also asked to provide psychological counseling and support to prevent psychological trauma of minors.Moreover, the law emphasized the importance of sex education and self-protection awareness of minors, asking related departments and organizations to conduct sex education that is appropriate for the minor's age.At the same time, the law introduced new job rules to further prevent child sex abuse, requiring kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and certification bodies that grant teacher qualifications must check the legal record of the job seekers and teaching candidates to exclude and disqualify those who have been charged with or convicted of child molestation or sexual abuses.China's freshly revised Law on the Protection of Minors was adopted with a vote at the 22nd Session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress on Saturday.The revised law, introduced in 1991 and revised in 2006, has significantly increased the number of articles from 72 to 130, adding two new chapters involved government protection and online protection for minors.The new law includes general provisions and protections for the areas of family, school, society, Internet, government, judiciary as well as legal responsibility and supplementary provisions.

Trump's wife and son have already recovered from the infection."Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms," Melania Trump said in a statement. She said she and Barron had since tested negative for the virus.Trump told a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, that Barron "is just fine now" and said it was an example of why schools should reopen."I don't even think he knew he had it, because they're young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off," Trump said. "Get the kids back to school," he said.The newspaper reported that officials in the administration have hoped Trump could use his own infection experience to relate it to the U.S. public, especially those who have suffered from the pandemic, as well as provide some basic health guidelines."He looks completely out of touch," Mike DuHaime, a Republican consultant close to former New Jersey governor Chris Christie who were infected with the virus, told the publication. "He doesn't appreciate what it would be like for a regular person. He gets the best medical treatment of everyone in the world and is acting like he's Superman. It really reinforces a lot of negative notions about him and how he handled coronavirus from the beginning."But the White House said that the president is just sending a message "of strength and optimism.""Any suggestion that the President of the United States has not taken the threat of COVID-19 seriously is completely false," White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. "As the entire country has confronted COVID-19, President Trump has never wavered in his message of strength and optimism to the American people, and as he personally defeated the virus the President has once again reminded the nation that he is a fighter and that if we all fight together we will defeat this."(With input from Reuters)The President of the United States Donald Trump is using his own recovery from COVID-19 infections to give an impression that the pandemic is going away and push for a return of society back to normalcy, according to the Washington Post, citing current and former administration officials.The article published on Friday said that despite the outbreak that has affected Trump's family members and top aides, the president and his administration are still downplaying the virus, saying that the country is "turning the corner."First Lady Melania Trump, their son Barron Trump and dozens of White House officials have contracted COVID-19.

She said she and Barron had since tested negative for the virus.Trump told a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, that Barron "is just fine now" and said it was an example of why schools should reopen."I don't even think he knew he had it, because they're young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off," Trump said. "Get the kids back to school," he said.The newspaper reported that officials in the administration have hoped Trump could use his own infection experience to relate it to the U.S. public, especially those who have suffered from the pandemic, as well as provide some basic health guidelines."He looks completely out of touch," Mike DuHaime, a Republican consultant close to former New Jersey governor Chris Christie who were infected with the virus, told the publication. "He doesn't appreciate what it would be like for a regular person. He gets the best medical treatment of everyone in the world and is acting like he's Superman. It really reinforces a lot of negative notions about him and how he handled coronavirus from the beginning."But the White House said that the president is just sending a message "of strength and optimism.""Any suggestion that the President of the United States has not taken the threat of COVID-19 seriously is completely false," White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. "As the entire country has confronted COVID-19, President Trump has never wavered in his message of strength and optimism to the American people, and as he personally defeated the virus the President has once again reminded the nation that he is a fighter and that if we all fight together we will defeat this."(With input from Reuters)Chinese President Xi Jinping has underscored the perseverance and determination of the nation to win the battle against poverty.Party committees and governments at all levels must maintain the momentum of fighting poverty and never stop until they have won a complete victory, Xi stressed in a directive issued as the country observes its seventh National Poverty Relief Day, which falls on October 17.Read more:Graphics: President Xi Jinping's words on poverty alleviationGraphics: Ending China's poverty by 20207 months left, how can all Chinese counties shake off poverty?The year 2020 marks the concluding phase for China's endeavor to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and to win the battle against poverty, the Chinese president noted.Facing the dual challenges of COVID-19 and floods, China is still determined to accomplish the tasks for winning the battle against poverty this year, he said. Describing the country's poverty alleviation achievements as "decisive," Xi urged all parties to achieve the intended goals as planned in the final stage of the tough battle. He pointed out that all regions and departments should sum up their experience in poverty eradication and give full play to their institutional advantages."We should continue to promote both poverty alleviation and rural revitalization in an all-out effort," Xi said, adding that the country should keep poverty alleviation policies stable. Stressing multiple measures to consolidate achievements, Xi called for enhancing the development capacity of the low-income population in underdeveloped and rural areas, encouraging low-income population with the capacity to achieve prosperity through hard-work and facilitating the gradual realization of common prosperity. The poverty alleviation goal should be fulfilled on time with maximum effort and high quality, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in his instruction on poverty.He urged to speed up efforts to lift the remaining impoverished counties out of poverty, develop industries with local features to grow incomes for farmers, stabilize poor population' employment and provide relocated residents with follow-up support."Once the risk of returning to poverty is discovered, assistance should be undertaken at once," Li added.The instructions were delivered at a national teleconference on Saturday, at which China honored individuals and institutions with a national award for their outstanding work in poverty alleviation. Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, met the awardees in Beijing on Saturday.Wang congratulated the award-winning workers and lauded the people battling poverty on China's front lines.

recent diplomatic interactions with Southeast Asian countries have enhanced unity between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and deepened the cooperation of regional anti-pandemic fight, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Friday.He made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua after holding talks last week with Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesian president's special envoy, and Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and wrapped up Friday his Southeast Asia tour, which has taken him to Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand and Singapore.This is Wang's first tour to Southeast Asian countries in the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.Strengthen unityThe Chinese foreign minister believes that his visit has first of all enhanced the unity between China and the ASEAN."We have exchanged views and reached a series of consensus on major issues, such as jointly responding to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving international situation, deepening bilateral relations, maintaining regional peace and stability, and improving the global governance system," Wang said.He noted that all parties should further enhance mutual trust and solidarity, and continue to push forward the development of relations between China and ASEAN countries, so as to bring them to higher levels.Deepen cooperationFurthermore, cooperation on the fight against the pandemic has been deepened, Wang said.It is agreed that East Asia has made outstanding achievements in combating against COVID-19, which comes from countries' commitment to putting the people first, taking scientific epidemic prevention measures, sticking together and providing mutual assistance and support, Wang said.All parties should improve the level of joint prevention and control against the pandemic, enhance the exchange of prevention and treatment experience, and strengthen cooperation in vaccine research and development, production and use, he added.China, Wang said, will continue to help ASEAN countries to prevail over the pandemic, including providing necessary anti-epidemic materials, carrying out cooperation on vaccine, assisting the establishment of nucleic acid testing laboratories, supporting ASEAN in launching an anti-epidemic fund, and establishing repositories for emergency medical supplies.According to Wang, the Southeast countries have spoken highly of China's vaccine research and development and expressed the hope to conduct all-dimension cooperation with China in vaccine research and development, purchase, production and use.On the issue concerning the life and health of all mankind, the international community should cooperate with each other, he said, adding "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the necessary conditions for global vaccine development.China has made it clear that it is willing to make efforts within its capacity in vaccine development, and give priority to the needs of developing countries including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, he added.Promote economic recoveryThirdly, the economic recovery in post-pandemic era was promoted, Wang noted."All parties have spoken highly of China's major anti-epidemic achievements and its progress in the resumption of work and production, and they look forward to and believe that China will continue to be the main engine driving global economic recovery," Wang said.They all hope to take the opportunity of China's "dual circulation" development pattern and dock China's Belt and Road Initiative with their own countries' development strategies, so as to embark on the fast track of post-pandemic economic recovery as soon as possible, he said.Enhance regional peace and stabilityThe fourth is that the visits have strengthened regional peace and stability, said Wang.In the face of foreign forces stirring up trouble and creating tension in the South China Sea, Wang noted that the Chinese side has emphasized that the South China Sea should not become a sea for great powers to play games or for gunboats to overrun, which is generally recognized by all parties.The countries agreed to resolve differences through friendly consultation, fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea as well as endeavor for an early conclusion of a more binding and effective Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region, he added.Safeguard international equityFifth, the visits have safeguarded international equity and justice, Wang said.He said that the countries have expressed the need to oppose power politics and unilateral bullying, uphold the basic norms of international relations, firmly practice the concepts of multilateralism and win-win cooperation, and make joint efforts to promote democratization of international relations and multi-polarization of the world.Access to COVID-19 vaccineWang also reiterated China's willingness to make efforts within its capacity in vaccine development, and give priority to the needs of developing countries including the ASEAN countries.Speaking on how China will fulfill its commitment to make vaccines a global public good, Wang said that the virus knows no borders, and only when all countries get rid of the epidemic can the global fight against the COVID-19 be a final victory.Vaccines are the "ultimate weapon" to prevail over the epidemic, he said, calling on international community to working jointly on issues concerning the life and health of all mankind. "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the necessary conditions for global vaccine development.China will earnestly fulfill its commitment to make vaccines a global public product once they are successfully developed and put into use, and will contribute to the accessibility and affordability of the vaccines in developing countries, Wang pledged.'Dual circulation'Wang noted that a new economic development pattern featuring "dual circulation," in which domestic and overseas markets complement and reinforce each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay, has been a major strategic deployment by the Chinese government."China will promote high-quality development and build a new system of an open economy of a higher level," Wang said. "The scale of the domestic market will be further expanded. The combination of the domestic and international markets will be closer. There will be more room for cooperation between countries and China."ASEAN countries are in the best position to draw momentum from China's new development pattern and seize the opportunity, Wang noted, adding that they are also in the best position to expand mutual benefit and achieve economic recovery and better development with China.China's huge market size will first benefit its neighbors, providing ASEAN countries with a broader export market, said the Chinese minister.China is ready to work with ASEAN countries to implement an upgraded China-ASEAN Free Trade Area protocol and sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership within this year, continue to make the China International Import Expo and the China-ASEAN Expo a success, and import more products needed by the Chinese market from ASEAN countries, Wang said.(With input from Xinhua)The recent diplomatic interactions with Southeast Asian countries have enhanced unity between China and the Association of

Chinese President Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.China's economy faces challenges as the world is undergoing profound changes, the meeting said. As a significant part of the "dual circulation" strategy, the Chengdu-Chongqing economic rim will bring high-quality growth for the region, widen the market and stabilize the production chain and supply chain.The economic rim aims to make the two megacities important growth engines, innovation hubs, and desirable cities to live for the vast regions in western China, it said.The plan also asks Chengdu and Chongqing to play a leading role in China's Belt and Road Initiative and promote economic connectivity with regional countries.But the meeting didn't release a roadmap for the implementation of the strategy. 'Dual circulation' modelPresident Xi first raised the idea of "dual circulation" in May and later elaborated that China will rely mainly on "internal circulation" - the domestic cycle of production, distribution, and consumption - for its development, supported by innovation and upgrades of the economy.Xi also said "internal circulation" will be supported by "external circulation"."Dual circulation" is by no means a closed domestic loop, Xi has emphasized on different occasions, reaffirming that opening-up was a fundamental national policy.Speaking to local people during his recent inspection in Guangdong Province, Xi said he was there to send a clear message that China will continue to walk down the road of reform and opening-up. China must adhere to the opening-up policy in an all-round way and enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going global," Xi reasserted at the event marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ).Chengdu, located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, is known for its China Panda Base. It has a population of 16.3 million.In recent years, the city is prioritizing environmental protection, public space and quality of life as the agenda while seeking to protect it from the kind of urbanization and development that has stripped its character.With a 2,000-year history, Chengdu, also an early center of Taoism, is known for preserving Chinese traditions in a way other urban centers don't have.People in Panda City spend more as sun sets The city is also an important gateway to the west. It is connected to 55 overseas cities and 16 Chinese cities through the China-Europe freight trains.Since its launch in 2013, Chengdu has seen more than 6,000 accumulative trips, according to the administrative committee of the Chengdu International Railway Port.Goods transported through the freight trains are worth nearly 200 billion yuan (about $29 billion), it said.The China-Europe freight train service is one of the major routes within the the Belt and Road Initiative.Chongqing was separated from Sichuan and became China's fourth municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the central government in 1997.The municipality, with a population of over 30 million, is one of China's fastest-growing cities. Guardian once described it as the "invisible" city and the city hidden in the fog.In 2019, both cities ranked ranked among the top 10 for total GDP among Chinese cities. According to government papers, the Chengdu-Chongqing city cluster consists of 42 cities, districts, and counties in Sichuan and Chongqing, covering 185,000 square kilometers and nearly 100 million people.Official data showed that the city cluster's overall economy has increased from 3.76 trillion yuan ($547 billion) in 2014 to nearly 6 trillion yuan in 2018.(Cover: Chengdu opens panda-themed train, a tourist line taking people to see its old towns and modern infrastructure in 2018.

Has the trajectory of campaign changed over the last week?The national pictureThe national polls have heavily favored Biden in the fallout period from the first presidential debate and Trump testing positive for COVID-19, and that trend has continued over the past seven days with the Democrat hitting the 50-percent mark for the first time in CGTN's analysis of publicly-available opinion polls.Biden stretched his lead over Trump from 8.3 points to 8.6 over the week, leaving him in a strong position and suggesting the president will need everything to go right in the swing states if he is to have a chance of re-election â and will have to make the second presidential debate, scheduled for October 22, count. High-quality individual national polls in recent days have consistently indicated Biden holds a double-digit lead, with YouGov, Reuters, NBC and NPR surveys suggesting Trump is down by at least 10 points.In the generic ballot, a measure of which party voters intend to back in congressional elections in November, Democrats are leading the Republicans by 7 points in the RealClearPolitics average, up from 6.6 a week earlier. While the Democrats appear likely to retain control of the House of Representatives, the battle for an all-important majority in the Senate remains neck and neck.The states that matterThe extent of Biden's national polling lead suggests he's almost certain to win the popular vote, just as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, but it's the individual states that matter in the Electoral College system.CGTN analysis of state polling indicates the Democrat has an advantage over Trump in many of the battlegrounds, though the margins are smaller than his national lead.Both Biden and Trump again campaigned in the pivotal state of Florida â now the president's home state â over the past week, and polling suggests the fight for its 29 electoral votes is narrowing: the Democrat has a 3.2-point lead, down from 3.4 points seven days ago.Trump held a televised town hall in Miami on Thursday following the cancellation of the second debate, as Biden took part in a similar event at the same time from Pennsylvania, the Midwestern state that the Republican is currently putting the most resources towards keeping in his column.Winning the Blue Wall of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin pushed Trump over the edge in 2016, but his campaign has diverted cash away from the latter two states over the past two weeks. Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes, is shaping up to be crucial: Biden holds a 6.2-point lead in the state of his birth, according to the polling averages, down from 6.3 a week ago.Polls only provide a snapshot in time and have a margin of error, but the state-by-state surveys suggest if the election were held today Biden could be on course to win 355 Electoral College votes to Trump's 183, unchanged since last week.Twitter rowsCGTN is using exclusive AI technology to weigh sentiment towards tweets related to the election, updating every 24 hours to reflect whether comments about Trump and Biden are positive, negative or neutral.Sentiment towards the candidates followed a familiar pattern over the past seven days, with tweets related to Trump a net negative 4.2 by daily average and tweets related to Biden net positive 7.9. Twitter itself was at the center of two election-related storms over the past week, suspending fake accounts claiming to be run by Black supporters of Trump only after being alerted to the issue by a newspaper investigation and then blocking an unsubstantiated New York Post article about Hunter Biden, the son of the Democratic nominee. The decision to block the URL of the Biden article and lock the account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, after she posted the link, led to uproar from Republicans.Money talksIn the money stakes, the two candidates are on very different tracks in the final stretch of the election.The Biden campaign and its affiliated committees set a new monthly fundraising record by hauling in $383 million in September, a huge $135.2 million more than Trump and his affiliates' $247.8 million.The Democrat's big cash advantage in the closing stages of the race is already evident in how the campaigns are spending their money.Trump, with $251.4 million on hand at the start of October, according to his campaign, cancelled ad buys in Midwestern states he probably needs to win and diverted cash to Sunbelt states that he simply cannot afford to lose.Biden, with $432 million in reserve, expanded his spending into traditionally Republican states including Texas, where polling suggests he only narrowly trails the president. The combination of polling numbers and cash on hand favoring the Democrat mean that with a little more than two weeks to go, the Trump campaign is on the defensive while Biden is in a strong position to attack as the campaigns head towards Thursday's final debate. (Graphics by Li Yueyun)Scan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.Joe Biden and Donald Trump resumed something like a traditional presidential campaign over the past seven days with the clock ticking ever closer to the November 3 election day in the United States.The Democrat and Republican candidates crisscrossed the country to meet voters and win airtime, with the former vice president using his cash advantage â after another record-breaking fundraising month in September â to expand his ad buys and put the president's campaign on the back foot in Texas, North Carolina, Iowa and Georgia, all states Trump won comfortably in 2016.CGTN's interactive page offers in-depth analysis of the 2020 election, with exclusive data covering national and state-by-state polling, online sentiment and fundraising.

Zhao warned. China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward and the development of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) will never pause, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed on Friday.In an article titled "Two Decades of a Shared Journey toward New Heights in the New Era" to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese foreign minister called for increasing cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, and achieving greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.According to Wang, in the last 20 years, the FOCAC has witnessed the consolidation of the political foundation of both sides, fruitful practical cooperation results, increased people-to-people exchange and strengthened mutual support.He said the FOCAC is a source of inspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations as the two sides have always pursued solidarity, consultation, and cooperation, advanced win-win cooperation for development, supported each other in trying times and embraced openness and inclusiveness.Looking into the future, Wang said China and Africa should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for the mankind, set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation and unleash a greater potential in practical cooperation.Here is the full text of Wang's article:This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). On October 12, President Xi Jinping and President Macky Sall of Senegal, the current African Co-Chair of the FOCAC, issued a joint congratulatory message to mark this important occasion. Embracing the dawn of the new century and the trend of peace and development 20 years ago, China and our brothers in Africa decided to initiate the FOCAC to promote win-win cooperation. Since then, the family of China and African nations has had its own platform for collective dialogue and mechanism for practical cooperation, ushering in a brand new chapter in China-Africa relations.IThe past 20 years have been a journey of productive cooperation. The FOCAC has bolstered high-level interactions and political trust between China and Africa, delivering a leap in China-Africa relations from "a new type of partnership" to "a new type of strategic partnership" and to "a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership."China-Africa cooperation has made impressive achievements. In 2019, direct Chinese investment stock in Africa topped $49.1 billion, up by nearly 100 times from the year 2000; China-Africa trade reached $208.7 billion, 20 times the size of 2000. China has been Africa's largest trading partner for 11 years in a row, and has contributed more than 20 percent to Africa's growth for a number of years. Many flagship projects, such as the African Union (AU) Conference Center, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, and the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, among many others, have been completed and put into use. Cooperation in other fields, ranging from science, education, culture and health to people-to-people exchange, peace and security, has also made significant headway.Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), President Xi Jinping has set great store by China's relations with Africa. He personally laid down principles guiding China's Africa policy, including sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and pursuing the greater good and shared interests, and called for building a stronger China-Africa community with a shared future. His devotion to leadership diplomacy with Africa has given a strong boost to the relations between the two sides.The political foundation has been cemented. In 2013, President Xi Jinping chose Africa as the destination of his first overseas visit as the Head of State of China. So far, he has visited Africa four times, covering all sub-regions of the continent. In 2015 and 2018, Chinese and African leaders convened two historic FOCAC summits: one in Johannesburg and another in Beijing. In June this year, the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19 was held at a critical moment in tackling the coronavirus. Political interactions between the two sides are more frequent, extensive and unprecedented in scale. For example, on the sidelines of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, President Xi Jinping attended more than 70 bilateral and multilateral events in eight days. With the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Gambia, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, and Burkina Faso, the China-Africa family has been further expanded.Practical cooperation has been fruitful. China-Africa economic and trade cooperation has been growing at a higher speed, demonstrating three encouraging shifts: from government-driven to market-driven, from trade in goods to industrial cooperation, and from engineering contracts to investment and operations. Together, the two sides have drafted and implemented 10 cooperation plans and eight major initiatives, taking practical cooperation to a new level. China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation is progressing with a strong momentum: 44 African countries and the AU Commission have signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, and a host of projects such as railways, roads, airports, ports and power stations have come to fruition, enabling remarkable change in Africa's economic and social development.People-to-people exchanges have been thriving. Events across a diverse range of areas, including the China-Africa Youth Festival, the Think Tank Forum, the Joint Research and Exchange Program, the Poverty Reduction and Development Conference, and the China-Africa Press Center, have been successful. And the China-Africa Institute has been inaugurated. So far, China has provided about 120,000 government scholarships to African countries, set up 61 Confucius Institutes and 44 Confucius Classrooms in collaboration with 46 African countries, sent 21,000 doctors and nurses in medical teams to 48 African countries, treating around 220 million African patients, and forged 150 pairs of sister cities. All these efforts have consolidated popular support for China-Africa friendship.Mutual support has been further strengthened. China and Africa fought side by side against both Ebola and COVID-19. The two sides have supported each other on issues of each other's core interests and major concerns. China-Africa peace and security cooperation has been enhanced. The two sides have jointly supported multilateralism, opposed unilateralism and protectionism, safeguarded the international order and international system with the United Nations at the core, and promoted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other basic norms governing international relations. Such collaboration has effectively upheld the shared interests of developing countries as well as the overall interests of the whole international community.IIThe past 20 years have been a journey of overcoming challenges and enhancing partnerships. The FOCAC has withstood the test of the volatile international landscape, and scored historic achievements. It is a vivid epitome of China's pioneering efforts in foreign affairs under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. It is also a source of aspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations.We have always pursued solidarity, consultation and cooperation. China is the largest developing country and the African continent home to the largest number of developing countries. When China-Africa cooperation prospers, South-South cooperation will prosper. When the voice of the 2.6 billion people in China and Africa are heeded and respected, the world will have genuine fairness and justice.From the very beginning, we have always taken China-Africa relations as part of South-South cooperation, and have advanced the FOCAC in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. The FOCAC, composed of China and 53 African countries and the AU, is by no means "one vs. 54", but "54 plus one". We would sit down in consultation whenever there is an issue, and solve it through discussion. And that is the guiding principle for our conduct. China has never interfered in African countries' pursuit of development paths that suit their own national conditions, never imposed its will upon others, never attached any political strings to its assistance, and never sought selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation.We have attached great importance to the Forum's role in drafting overall plans and providing strategic guidance, and we have paid equal attention to China's ties with each FOCAC member, so that the Forum mechanism and bilateral cooperation can complement each other in forging a strong network of partnerships between and among countries. The Forum has significantly increased the international profile of China-Africa relations, and has become a pacesetter for South-South cooperation and cooperation by the international community with Africa.We have always advanced win-win cooperation for development. Both China and Africa are at a crucial stage of development and rejuvenation. The Chinese and African peoples are entitled to live a better life. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that no one could hold back the Chinese people or the African people as we march toward rejuvenation. Cooperation and development have always been FOCAC's top priority. We have fully leveraged our unique strengths, such as the great complementarity between our economies and development stages. We have developed greater synergy between our development strategies and embarked on a path of win-win cooperation with distinctive features.Our cooperation is about action and results. Every three years, the FOCAC rolls out a package action plan. The 2018 Beijing Summit alone produced more than 880 deliverables. We always deliver and we do not make empty promises. We have kept pace with the times and kept our mind open to break new ground and tide over challenging times. According to African friends, the FOCAC is a cooperation mechanism that truly delivers.We have always supported each other in trying times. China-Africa friendship was born in the formidable years of national liberation and is deeply rooted in our peoples' heart. As President Xi said, China and Africa are friends tested by adversity, and such friends must never be forgotten.During the 2008 international financial crisis, China and Africa rendered each other valuable support. Instead of reducing assistance, China bucked the trend and increased its support to Africa. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, when others chose to leave, Chinese doctors and nurses braved their lives and rushed to the hard-hit regions to help local people fight the disease, writing an indelible chapter in the history of humanitarian assistance of the People's Republic of China. Faced with the onslaught of COVID-19 worldwide, China and Africa have again stood shoulder to shoulder to help each other.What we have gone through together shows that China and Africa are more than just partners. We are comrades-in-arms. The more severe the difficulties, the more determined and confident we are about China-Africa cooperation, and the more capable the FOCAC is in pooling our strengths to forge ahead, making itself the key driving force for the time-honored China-Africa friendship.We have always embraced openness and inclusiveness. The FOCAC was established to answer the call of the times for peace, development and win-win cooperation. It serves as a fine example of multilateralism. China and Africa have all along upheld the principle of openness and inclusiveness. A closed-door policy or exclusiveness is never an option. Colonial plunder and the Cold-War rivalry brought excruciating sufferings to the African people. That part of history must not be repeated. Africa must never again be an arena for major-power rivalry. This belief is widely shared by people across Africa, and should be respected by the entire international community.Openness is vital in cooperation with Africa. It is important to share experience and learn from one another, so that Africa's peace and development can benefit from the common effort and contribution of the international community. Africa's cooperation with China has improved its development capacity and business environment, which in turn has created favorable conditions for other countries' cooperation with the continent. China has taken part in more Africa-related trilateral and multilateral cooperation in recent years. We commend and encourage such cooperation and will continue our support.IIIThe past 20 years have been a journey of China and Africa coming together as one community with a shared future. Today, the world is being shaped by changes unseen in a century, a process accelerated by COVID-19. China and Africa are good friends, partners and brothers, and more importantly, an important force for world peace and development. In this changing world, China and Africa need to stay united and work more closely together to make the FOCAC a greater success and further strengthen China-Africa relations, so as to further enhance our friendship and justice in the world.China and Africa can and should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind. The more complex and fluid the international landscape is, the greater the imperative for China and Africa to adhere to the fundamental direction of building a China-Africa community with a shared future. We should continue to follow the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith as well as the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. We need to maintain the momentum of high-level exchange, share more governance experience with each other, build a stronger bond between the Chinese and African peoples, and continue to elevate the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. We need to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, step up mutual support on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and work together for greater democracy in international relations. We need to take the side of the overwhelming majority of the international community, stay committed to multilateralism, and align global governance reforms with the common interests of developing countries. With these efforts, we will make the China-Africa relationship a trailblazer and a shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind.China and Africa can and should set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation. China and Africa have fought hard for what we have achieved in tackling COVID-19. As the virus continues to spread globally, both China and Africa are confronted with the formidable task of combating the virus while stabilizing the economy and protecting people's livelihoods. We will speed up the implementation of the important measures that President Xi Jinping announced at the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, and make China's contribution to making vaccines accessible and affordable for African countries as soon as possible. China will continue to provide COVID-19 containment supplies, send expert teams, and facilitate Africa's procurement of medical supplies from China. China will strive for breaking ground for the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters by the end of this year. These are concrete actions that will show the world that China and Africa have the determination and strength to defeat COVID-19 together.China and Africa can and should unleash greater potential in practical cooperation. COVID-19 will not hamper China-Africa cooperation. As one of the first countries to fully reopen the economy, China aims to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will bring new opportunities for China and Africa to deepen, transform and upgrade their cooperation. China supports Africa's effort to develop the African Continental Free Trade Area. We encourage Chinese companies and financial institutions to take an active part in infrastructure connectivity projects in Africa, which will facilitate cross-border logistics and customs clearance. We are ready to work with the international community in supporting Africa's integration process and sub-regional economic community-building. China hopes to work with Africa to deepen the integration of our industrial and supply chains, and encourages Chinese businesses to invest and conduct technological cooperation in Africa. We will support Africa's agricultural modernization and industrialization drive to raise the added value and competitiveness of Africa's exported energy, mineral and agricultural products. China will work with the international community to support Africa's integration into the global industrial and supply chains. China and Africa should to join hands in pursuing green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. This will contribute to African countries' ability to tackle climate change.As an ancient Chinese saying goes: "Having scaled a cloud-shrouded mountain peak, we rest our horses and set sail for the vast ocean." The China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward. The development of the FOCAC will never take a break. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will continue to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and, with the personal commitment and support of Chinese and African leaders, increase the cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, tighten China-Africa ties against all odds, and achieve greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward and the development of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) will never pause, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed on Friday.In an article titled "Two Decades of a Shared Journey toward New Heights in the New Era" to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese foreign minister called for increasing cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, and achieving greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.According to Wang, in the last 20 years, the FOCAC has witnessed the consolidation of the political foundation of both sides, fruitful practical cooperation results, increased people-to-people exchange and strengthened mutual support.He said the FOCAC is a source of inspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations as the two sides have always pursued solidarity, consultation, and cooperation, advanced win-win cooperation for development, supported each other in trying times and embraced openness and inclusiveness.Looking into the future, Wang said China and Africa should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for the mankind, set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation and unleash a greater potential in practical cooperation.Here is the full text of Wang's article:This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).

Together, the two sides have drafted and implemented 10 cooperation plans and eight major initiatives, taking practical cooperation to a new level. China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation is progressing with a strong momentum: 44 African countries and the AU Commission have signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, and a host of projects such as railways, roads, airports, ports and power stations have come to fruition, enabling remarkable change in Africa's economic and social development.People-to-people exchanges have been thriving. Events across a diverse range of areas, including the China-Africa Youth Festival, the Think Tank Forum, the Joint Research and Exchange Program, the Poverty Reduction and Development Conference, and the China-Africa Press Center, have been successful. And the China-Africa Institute has been inaugurated. So far, China has provided about 120,000 government scholarships to African countries, set up 61 Confucius Institutes and 44 Confucius Classrooms in collaboration with 46 African countries, sent 21,000 doctors and nurses in medical teams to 48 African countries, treating around 220 million African patients, and forged 150 pairs of sister cities. All these efforts have consolidated popular support for China-Africa friendship.Mutual support has been further strengthened. China and Africa fought side by side against both Ebola and COVID-19. The two sides have supported each other on issues of each other's core interests and major concerns. China-Africa peace and security cooperation has been enhanced. The two sides have jointly supported multilateralism, opposed unilateralism and protectionism, safeguarded the international order and international system with the United Nations at the core, and promoted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other basic norms governing international relations. Such collaboration has effectively upheld the shared interests of developing countries as well as the overall interests of the whole international community.IIThe past 20 years have been a journey of overcoming challenges and enhancing partnerships. The FOCAC has withstood the test of the volatile international landscape, and scored historic achievements. It is a vivid epitome of China's pioneering efforts in foreign affairs under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. It is also a source of aspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations.We have always pursued solidarity, consultation and cooperation. China is the largest developing country and the African continent home to the largest number of developing countries. When China-Africa cooperation prospers, South-South cooperation will prosper. When the voice of the 2.6 billion people in China and Africa are heeded and respected, the world will have genuine fairness and justice.From the very beginning, we have always taken China-Africa relations as part of South-South cooperation, and have advanced the FOCAC in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. The FOCAC, composed of China and 53 African countries and the AU, is by no means "one vs. 54", but "54 plus one". We would sit down in consultation whenever there is an issue, and solve it through discussion. And that is the guiding principle for our conduct. China has never interfered in African countries' pursuit of development paths that suit their own national conditions, never imposed its will upon others, never attached any political strings to its assistance, and never sought selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation.We have attached great importance to the Forum's role in drafting overall plans and providing strategic guidance, and we have paid equal attention to China's ties with each FOCAC member, so that the Forum mechanism and bilateral cooperation can complement each other in forging a strong network of partnerships between and among countries. The Forum has significantly increased the international profile of China-Africa relations, and has become a pacesetter for South-South cooperation and cooperation by the international community with Africa.We have always advanced win-win cooperation for development. Both China and Africa are at a crucial stage of development and rejuvenation. The Chinese and African peoples are entitled to live a better life. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that no one could hold back the Chinese people or the African people as we march toward rejuvenation. Cooperation and development have always been FOCAC's top priority. We have fully leveraged our unique strengths, such as the great complementarity between our economies and development stages. We have developed greater synergy between our development strategies and embarked on a path of win-win cooperation with distinctive features.Our cooperation is about action and results. Every three years, the FOCAC rolls out a package action plan. The 2018 Beijing Summit alone produced more than 880 deliverables. We always deliver and we do not make empty promises. We have kept pace with the times and kept our mind open to break new ground and tide over challenging times. According to African friends, the FOCAC is a cooperation mechanism that truly delivers.We have always supported each other in trying times. China-Africa friendship was born in the formidable years of national liberation and is deeply rooted in our peoples' heart. As President Xi said, China and Africa are friends tested by adversity, and such friends must never be forgotten.During the 2008 international financial crisis, China and Africa rendered each other valuable support. Instead of reducing assistance, China bucked the trend and increased its support to Africa. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, when others chose to leave, Chinese doctors and nurses braved their lives and rushed to the hard-hit regions to help local people fight the disease, writing an indelible chapter in the history of humanitarian assistance of the People's Republic of China. Faced with the onslaught of COVID-19 worldwide, China and Africa have again stood shoulder to shoulder to help each other.What we have gone through together shows that China and Africa are more than just partners. We are comrades-in-arms. The more severe the difficulties, the more determined and confident we are about China-Africa cooperation, and the more capable the FOCAC is in pooling our strengths to forge ahead, making itself the key driving force for the time-honored China-Africa friendship.We have always embraced openness and inclusiveness. The FOCAC was established to answer the call of the times for peace, development and win-win cooperation. It serves as a fine example of multilateralism. China and Africa have all along upheld the principle of openness and inclusiveness. A closed-door policy or exclusiveness is never an option. Colonial plunder and the Cold-War rivalry brought excruciating sufferings to the African people. That part of history must not be repeated. Africa must never again be an arena for major-power rivalry. This belief is widely shared by people across Africa, and should be respected by the entire international community.Openness is vital in cooperation with Africa. It is important to share experience and learn from one another, so that Africa's peace and development can benefit from the common effort and contribution of the international community. Africa's cooperation with China has improved its development capacity and business environment, which in turn has created favorable conditions for other countries' cooperation with the continent. China has taken part in more Africa-related trilateral and multilateral cooperation in recent years. We commend and encourage such cooperation and will continue our support.IIIThe past 20 years have been a journey of China and Africa coming together as one community with a shared future. Today, the world is being shaped by changes unseen in a century, a process accelerated by COVID-19. China and Africa are good friends, partners and brothers, and more importantly, an important force for world peace and development. In this changing world, China and Africa need to stay united and work more closely together to make the FOCAC a greater success and further strengthen China-Africa relations, so as to further enhance our friendship and justice in the world.China and Africa can and should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind. The more complex and fluid the international landscape is, the greater the imperative for China and Africa to adhere to the fundamental direction of building a China-Africa community with a shared future. We should continue to follow the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith as well as the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. We need to maintain the momentum of high-level exchange, share more governance experience with each other, build a stronger bond between the Chinese and African peoples, and continue to elevate the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. We need to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, step up mutual support on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and work together for greater democracy in international relations. We need to take the side of the overwhelming majority of the international community, stay committed to multilateralism, and align global governance reforms with the common interests of developing countries. With these efforts, we will make the China-Africa relationship a trailblazer and a shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind.China and Africa can and should set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation. China and Africa have fought hard for what we have achieved in tackling COVID-19. As the virus continues to spread globally, both China and Africa are confronted with the formidable task of combating the virus while stabilizing the economy and protecting people's livelihoods. We will speed up the implementation of the important measures that President Xi Jinping announced at the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, and make China's contribution to making vaccines accessible and affordable for African countries as soon as possible. China will continue to provide COVID-19 containment supplies, send expert teams, and facilitate Africa's procurement of medical supplies from China. China will strive for breaking ground for the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters by the end of this year. These are concrete actions that will show the world that China and Africa have the determination and strength to defeat COVID-19 together.China and Africa can and should unleash greater potential in practical cooperation. COVID-19 will not hamper China-Africa cooperation. As one of the first countries to fully reopen the economy, China aims to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will bring new opportunities for China and Africa to deepen, transform and upgrade their cooperation. China supports Africa's effort to develop the African Continental Free Trade Area. We encourage Chinese companies and financial institutions to take an active part in infrastructure connectivity projects in Africa, which will facilitate cross-border logistics and customs clearance. We are ready to work with the international community in supporting Africa's integration process and sub-regional economic community-building. China hopes to work with Africa to deepen the integration of our industrial and supply chains, and encourages Chinese businesses to invest and conduct technological cooperation in Africa. We will support Africa's agricultural modernization and industrialization drive to raise the added value and competitiveness of Africa's exported energy, mineral and agricultural products. China will work with the international community to support Africa's integration into the global industrial and supply chains. China and Africa should to join hands in pursuing green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. This will contribute to African countries' ability to tackle climate change.As an ancient Chinese saying goes: "Having scaled a cloud-shrouded mountain peak, we rest our horses and set sail for the vast ocean." The China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward. The development of the FOCAC will never take a break. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will continue to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and, with the personal commitment and support of Chinese and African leaders, increase the cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, tighten China-Africa ties against all odds, and achieve greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Friday he was not quitting after tens of thousands of anti-government protesters defied a ban on demonstrations and he warned them not to persist. The ban on gatherings of more than five people was imposed early on Thursday after nearly three months of protests that have called for a reduction in the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy as well as the removal of Prayuth. Read more:Thailand declares state of emergency to stop protestsProtesters defied the ban and staged one of the biggest demonstrations in Bangkok on Thursday evening. "I'm not quitting," Prayuth told reporters after an emergency cabinet meeting. "The government must use the emergency decree.

After falling by four million at the start of the pandemic because of a $2 trillion emergency federal aid package called the Cares Act, the number of poor people in the U.S. has risen by eight million since May.The University of Chicago and Notre Dame studies found poverty grew by six million people but unlike Columbia University, Chicago and Notre Dame show poverty has continued to grow rather than improve.Bruce D. Meyer, an economist at the University of Chicago and an author of the study told the New York Times these numbers are concerning. "They tell us people are having a lot more trouble paying their bills, paying their rent, putting food on the table," he said. The studies attribute the COVID-19 pandemic and the loss of the Cares Act to the rise in poverty. Columbia researchers say this aid helped keep more than 18 million people out of poverty during its peak in May.The program expanded unemployment benefits and provided stimulus checks for families. And while the Democrats in the House of Representatives has passed multi trillion-dollar aid package, the Republican led Senate has proposed smaller plans, leading to gridlock between both parties.The new studies from Chicago and Notre Dame also show poverty and the pandemic are impacting minority groups the hardest. "Black people and Latinos are more than twice as likely as white people to be poor," according to the studies.Based off new unemployment numbers, the AP reports the economy is still about 10.7 million jobs away from recovering the 22 million jobs lost when the pandemic started.Thursday's unemployment numbers also don't include California, which typically represents about one-fourth of unemployment claims in the country. The state paused processing new claims for two weeks so they could sort through a backlog of claims and implement fraud prevention technology.But unemployment applications rose in 17 other states. A report from Moody's Analytics released Thursday shows nearly 12 million households said they are unsure if they'll be able to continue their mortgage payments.Experts say the rise in unemployment and poverty shows a need for new federal aid. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

This of course means that we too have to make compromises."Instead of unfettered trade among EU member, a no-deal would leave both sides facing tariffs, custom duties and major regulatory burdens at a time when the pandemic has already created the worst economic crisis in decades.Knowing the chances of a deal are slimmer by the day, the EU leaders also urged all in the bloc to "step up their work on preparedness and readiness at all levels and for all outcomes, including that of no agreement."(Cover: File photo of the UK chief trade negotiator David Frost at the European Commission on in Brussels, Belgium./ Getty Images)China's disarmament diplomat Fu Cong on Thursday challenged U.S. claims on nuclear strategy transparency and nuclear arsenal, as Washington has repeatedly called for China to join the so-called trilateral negotiations with Russia.In terms of strategic calculation and avoiding miscalculation, China's nuclear strategy and intention are more transparent and predictable, as China pledges no-first-use of nuclear weapons and never use or threaten to employ nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states, said Fu, head of the arms control department of China's foreign ministry, in an interview with Russian newspaper Kommersant.Fu asserted that China pursues a self-defensive nuclear strategy, serving the purposes of safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and China takes nuclear weapons as the "ultimate deterrence," rejecting U.S. allegations of the so-called China threat.Out of safety and security concerns, China's modernizing its nuclear capacity, and we hope the international society could take an unbiased view on China's effort, Fu said.In fact nuclear forces of other nuclear powers are also undergoing modernization, and the U.S. even plans to inject $1.2 trillion to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, he pointed out.The U.S., with about 6,000 nuclear warheads, is expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence, Fu said, adding that this doctrine poses real threat to other countries.Fu reiterated that China will not participate in trilateral arms control negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to extend the New START, a flagship nuclear arms treaty between the two countries that is due to expire next February.Pressuring China to join such negotiations is "unfair, unreasonable and unfeasible," Fu said, given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is about 20 times the size of China's.China would "be happy to" participate in such talks with the U.S. and Russia, but only if the U.S. agrees to reduce its nuclear arsenal to China's level, Fu said. "But we know that's not going to happen in foreseeable future."For the U.S., urging China to engage in trilateral negotiations is "nothing but a ploy to divert attention" and an excuse for the U.S. to walk away from the New START extension.Fu maintained that China is not shying away from the international nuclear disarmament process and it actually plays an active role in pushing forward international disarmament within the framework of the United Nations.China's disarmament diplomat Fu Cong on Thursday challenged U.S. claims on nuclear strategy transparency and nuclear arsenal, as Washington has repeatedly called for China to join the so-called trilateral negotiations with Russia.In terms of strategic calculation and avoiding miscalculation, China's nuclear strategy and intention are more transparent and predictable, as China pledges no-first-use of nuclear weapons and never use or threaten to employ nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states, said Fu, head of the arms control department of China's foreign ministry, in an interview with Russian newspaper Kommersant.Fu asserted that China pursues a self-defensive nuclear strategy, serving the purposes of safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and China takes nuclear weapons as the "ultimate deterrence," rejecting U.S. allegations of the so-called China threat.Out of safety and security concerns, China's modernizing its nuclear capacity, and we hope the international society could take an unbiased view on China's effort, Fu said.In fact nuclear forces of other nuclear powers are also undergoing modernization, and the U.S. even plans to inject $1.2 trillion to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, he pointed out.The U.S., with about 6,000 nuclear warheads, is expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence, Fu said, adding that this doctrine poses real threat to other countries.Fu reiterated that China will not participate in trilateral arms control negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to extend the New START, a flagship nuclear arms treaty between the two countries that is due to expire next February.Pressuring China to join such negotiations is "unfair, unreasonable and unfeasible," Fu said, given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is about 20 times the size of China's.China would "be happy to" participate in such talks with the U.S. and Russia, but only if the U.S. agrees to reduce its nuclear arsenal to China's level, Fu said.

The two sides have overcome adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, maintained communication and exchanges and further deepened cooperation in all fields.While appreciating China's commitment to make its COVID-19 vaccine a global public good when available, Don said his country hopes to strengthen cooperation with China on vaccine development and open the "fast lane" to facilitate personnel exchanges at an early date.Thailand is steadily pacing up the construction of the Thailand-China high-speed rail and supports the connection between the China-Laos Railway and the Thailand-China high-speed rail. Thailand hopes that China will continue to support the construction of the country's Eastern Economic Corridor and enhance the cooperation in the fields of innovation and sustainable development, the Thai foreign minister said.Thailand is ready to step up coordination with China in regional and international affairs and advance the development of ties between ASEAN and China to strengthen international solidarity to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and revive the global economy, he added. China and Thailand have agreed to create "fast tracks" and "green lanes" to facilitate the flow of people and goods, China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday, as the two countries seek to revive their economies from the global coronavirus pandemic.The announcement came after Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's meeting with Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha in Bangkok.Thailand is the last stop of Wang's five-day visit to Southeast Asian countries.The two sides discussed cooperation in various fields in the post-pandemic era, and vowed strengthening ties.Wang also held separate talks with Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai, and the two signed cooperation documents.China-Thailand relations have shown resilience and huge potential during the COVID-19 pandemic, Wang said, adding that China is ready to work with Thailand to enhance anti-epidemic collaboration, conduct cooperation on vaccine and medicine research and development. The countries should advance the joint construction of the Belt and Road and speed up the building of the China-Thailand high-speed railway for an early connection to the China-Laos Railway in order to improve regional interconnectivity, Wang continued.Speaking of bilateral cooperation, Wang said China is ready to promote the connection between Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor initiative with south China's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and encourage Chinese enterprises to take part in the related projects.Regarding regional cooperation, Wang said China is willing to work with Thailand under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) framework to close the deal of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) within this year.He also said the two countries should implement the results achieved at the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Leaders' Meeting, push forward the synergy of the LMC and the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, and make the LMC and the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) Master Plan to complement each other.For his part, Don said this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

China's mass coordinated testing and targeted containment model, as shown with recent outbreaks in Beijing, Dalian and Urumqi, have proved continually successful in quashing a return of the virus, allowing life to continue as normal."This is totally different from how most European and other Western countries have approached the pandemic. Most countries still aren't conducting adequate tests. In countries such as Poland, France, Italy and Spain, mostly only the symptomatic cases are being tested and the positive cases are advised home quarantine and not immediate hospitalization as in China. And this is a huge mistake," said Dr Agnieszka Bielewicz, internal medicine specialist at ParkWayHealth, one of China's leading international healthcare providers.She noted that the European countries would do well to follow Qingdao's example. "When I say all the 9-10 million people in Qingdao are being tested, many in Europe find it hard to believe. I keep repeating that China's approach in fighting the pandemic has been absolutely outstanding and this is why people in China, including the foreigners, are really enjoying a mostly normal life now because we are free."Bielewicz, who has been living in China with her husband and three kids for over eight years, admitted however that she feels the pangs of "survival guilty" at times because her friends and relatives back in Poland cannot experience the same freedoms."It is a strange feeling. COVID-19 is not only affecting human life and health, it is affecting people's minds very deeply â their characters and feelings. It has turned our life upside down. Today, COVID-19 is affecting even global politics, economy, and each aspect of our life," she remarked thoughtfully.'I'm a doctor, I cannot give up'While the doctor now worries about her kith and kin in her home country, during the initial days of the outbreak when as a healthcare worker she was tending to her duties, it was her family and friends in Poland who were deeply concerned about her, as China was the epicenter of the pandemic at the time."As a foreign doctor, I was designated to work for the Chinese New Year holiday when all of my Chinese colleagues were to celebrate with their family. When the outbreak happened, I was already working. As the situation became uncertain, I decided to send my family back to Poland," she recalled."The entire time my family was in Poland, they were worried about my situation, about my work. And to this extent that they called me several times a day to check whether I have any symptoms," she said, noting the healthcare workers were at the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 and therefore more prone to infection."My family was really terrified that I was still working, but I'm a doctor, I cannot give up. I explained to them that due to the safety protocols and all the rules strictly introduced and implemented, I felt very safe even during the peak of the outbreak in China," she said.Bielewicz was fortunate to be reunited with her family before the international travel restrictions came into force and situation in Europe worsened. "With China enforcing strict prevention and control measures, things were improving here. I told my family that it is very safe here and they returned early March. Thankfully, my children didn't have to experience the full lockdown anywhere and they came back at a good time."'China is doing better than the rest'With COVID-19 subsequently spreading in Europe and other parts of the world, the world also witnessed a sustained campaign of disinformation against China and COVID-19, triggered by geopolitics.Bielewicz, as a health professional with a closer insight into the situation on the ground, felt compelled to clear some of the doubts through media appearances in Polish TV. At the time, people in Europe thought that the COVID-19 situation was horrific in China, that the hospitals were overcrowded, and that patients were dying in droves.The exaggerated media reports were laughable, the Polish doctor felt. "I gave several interviews to Polish TV channels explaining to them that the situation wasn't so crazy. We weren't dying [in droves]. We were not hungry. I showed them the photos of life in Shanghai, the buses, shops and streets. We could still use 'kuaidi' [express delivery] to buy things that we wanted," she elucidated.Bielewicz said people still find it hard to believe how successful China's COVID-19 fight has been. "Many people ask my mom, who is a nurse in Poland, about the situation in China and when she tells them that China has nearly curbed COVID-19 with almost zero local transmission and most new cases being imported, people react in disbelieve. They say it is impossible."The Polish healthcare professional felt that this is symptomatic of the Western media narrative that has constantly pushed a narrative of China as a "third-world" country and therefore people find it difficult to believe that "China is doing better than we are doing."Will there be a second wave?While the recent Qingdao outbreak has prompted fears about a second wave, more so, as the winter flu season is approaching in China, Bielewicz expressed confidence about the protocols and measures in place even if there's a spike."I'm not worried too much over a second wave in China. We just witnessed how everything was controlled in Qingdao and we also know the exact source," she said. The health professional, however, strongly advocated for flu vaccination."I and all of my family members, we have flu vaccination and I encourage my patients, especially those with existing ailments such as like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetic and obesity to take vaccination for flu. I also suggest to take a pneumococcal vaccination because it protects lives," she said."Besides, I've been a big fan of Vitamin D which helps in boosting our immune system and making our bodies stronger. This can help our body fight the virus better in case of an infection," she added.Interviewer and script: Abhishek G BhayaVideo editors: Chen Shi &amp; Li YahuiCover image: Li JingjieDirector: Mei YanMore CGTN Interviews:'China's carbon neutral goal: Bold and inspiring''When China and U.S. work together, the entire world wins' Radical China-U.S. decoupling will throw humanity back by decadese-RMB: China gears up for digital payment 2.0Currency War: Will China's e-RMB fade out dollar's global sheen?TikTok, Huawei and Trump's tech war on ChinaHimalayan crossroads: A bumpy road ahead for China-India tiesTracing the origin and ecology of coronavirusInnovative China drives the global AI revolutionChina-India-Pakistan cooperation key for unleashing South Asia's full potentialPost-Brexit UK needs a 'balanced approach' towards China and an FTAHK &amp; U.S.: A tale of two protests and Trump's doublespeak'Hong Kong protest is pure bigotry and racism'India's COVID-19 lockdown and its side effectsMERS experience, China's situation shaped S Korea's COVID-19 strategyPost COVID-19, tourism could be 'slow' but 'smart'From dreams to doubts: Chinese students reconsider U.S. options amid COVID-19 worriesChina's night economy surges amid COVID-19 lifestyle changesThe way China responded to the latest spate of COVID-19 cases in Qingdao is a stark reminder of how the "outstanding" Chinese approach in dealing with the pandemic is radically different from most Western countries, a Shanghai-based Polish doctor told CGTN Digital as she narrated how her professional and personal life has been affected by the pandemic.Authorities in Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province have collected nearly 10 million samples in a five-day nucleic acid testing campaign after the emergence of a handful of cases earlier this week.

On Thursday there were 6,638 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. The previous record was 6,294 on March 28, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The total number of cases now stands at 341,223 and the death toll has also increased, by 33 to 9,710.This comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Wednesday more measures to curb the pandemic, by lowering the threshold for a city to be considered a high risk-area from 35 to the previous 50 cases per 100,000. This will put a third of the whole country on "high-alert." The chancellor also warned more measures will be put in place in the coming days, such as stricter travel restrictions.  Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamPrime Minister Mark Rutte admitted his government made mistakes in managing the coronavirus crisis. According to Rutte, the previous package of measures was not severe enough. Also, the government had not thought through all the actions correctly, the prime minister said.In many places in the Netherlands, it was crowded on Wednesday evening in the last hours before pubs and restaurants had to close their doors. Images of people partying in The Hague caused a stir in parliament. Social media showed people singing and dancing in a crowded party tent in the city center. The mayor called their behavior "irresponsible" and is considering legal action against those present. Since Wednesday at 10 p.m., all restaurants, bars and cafes have been closed for at least four weeks. Take-away and delivery are still allowed.Unemployment in The Netherlands decreased for the first time since the start of the pandemic. In September, 4.4 percent of the active population was jobless, compared with 4.6 percent a month earlier. In February, the last "normal" month, unemployment was 2.9 percent.On Wednesday, there were 7,350 new infections in The Netherlands, a small fall from Tuesday. Nawied Jabarkhyl in LondonTighter lockdown restrictions have been imposed on the England's capital London. Measures, which come into effect at midnight on Friday, include a ban on households mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Similar rules are also being put in place in the regions of Essex and York and are being considered in Manchester as the government attempts to slow the spread of the virus.Meanwhile, the UK's former homelessness adviser has warned the country faces a "period of destitution," partly because of the coronavirus.

We need each other. We'll get through it together." Mia Alberti in FrankfurtGermany has hit a record-high number of daily cases. On Thursday there were 6,638 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. The previous record was 6,294 on March 28, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The total number of cases now stands at 341,223 and the death toll has also increased, by 33 to 9,710.This comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Wednesday more measures to curb the pandemic, by lowering the threshold for a city to be considered a high risk-area from 35 to the previous 50 cases per 100,000. This will put a third of the whole country on "high-alert." The chancellor also warned more measures will be put in place in the coming days, such as stricter travel restrictions.  Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamPrime Minister Mark Rutte admitted his government made mistakes in managing the coronavirus crisis. According to Rutte, the previous package of measures was not severe enough. Also, the government had not thought through all the actions correctly, the prime minister said.In many places in the Netherlands, it was crowded on Wednesday evening in the last hours before pubs and restaurants had to close their doors. Images of people partying in The Hague caused a stir in parliament. Social media showed people singing and dancing in a crowded party tent in the city center. The mayor called their behavior "irresponsible" and is considering legal action against those present. Since Wednesday at 10 p.m., all restaurants, bars and cafes have been closed for at least four weeks. Take-away and delivery are still allowed.Unemployment in The Netherlands decreased for the first time since the start of the pandemic. In September, 4.4 percent of the active population was jobless, compared with 4.6 percent a month earlier. In February, the last "normal" month, unemployment was 2.9 percent.On Wednesday, there were 7,350 new infections in The Netherlands, a small fall from Tuesday. Nawied Jabarkhyl in LondonTighter lockdown restrictions have been imposed on the England's capital London. Measures, which come into effect at midnight on Friday, include a ban on households mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Similar rules are also being put in place in the regions of Essex and York and are being considered in Manchester as the government attempts to slow the spread of the virus.Meanwhile, the UK's former homelessness adviser has warned the country faces a "period of destitution," partly because of the coronavirus. Louise Casey said the impact of COVID-19 could be devastating on the most deprived parts of the UK's population.  FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: IMF chief says China's recovery helps global recoveryCGTN America: Trump's youngest son Barron had COVID-19, now tests negativeCGTN Africa: COVID-19 causes "unimaginable" impact on Africa's socio economic landscapeSign up here to get the COVID-19 Europe bulletin sent directly to your inboxCGTN Europe has been providing in-depth coverage of the novel coronavirus story as it has unfolded. Here you can read the essential information about the crisis.Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the United States is seeking to destabilize Tibet by appointing the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues, calling the move an interference in China's internal affairs.On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Robert Destro as the special coordinator.Tibetan affairs are China's domestic affairs, and China strongly opposes any form of foreign interference, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a daily briefing."The setting up of the so-called coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China's internal affairs and destabilize Tibet. China firmly opposes that," Zhao said.Tibet has achieved remarkable social and economic growth since its peaceful liberation in 1950, and the living standard of the people there has also improved, he said.All ethnic groups in Tibet are part of the big family of the Chinese nation, and people in Tibet enjoy religious freedom, and their rights are fully respected, he added.Earlier on Thursday, Tibetan authorities announced that the region had eliminated absolute poverty, claiming a "major victory." China's Tibet Autonomous Region has achieved a "major victory" in alleviating poverty, Wu Yingjie, the Communist Party of China chief of the region, said at a press conference in Lhasa.  By the end of 2019, Tibet had lifted 628,000 people out of poverty and removed 74 county-level areas from the poverty list, Wu said. Tibet is now shifting its focus from tackling absolute poverty to consolidating poverty alleviation achievements, he continued.  The achievement shows "the advantages of the socialist system on the high plateau," Wu said.  (Cover: Nijia and his family pose for a photo in front of their house at the Rongma relocation settlement, a local poverty alleviation project, in Gurum Township of Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, April 2, 2020. /Xinhua)Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the United States is seeking to destabilize Tibet by appointing the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues, calling the move an interference in China's internal affairs.On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Robert Destro as the special coordinator.Tibetan affairs are China's domestic affairs, and China strongly opposes any form of foreign interference, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a daily briefing."The setting up of the so-called coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China's internal affairs and destabilize Tibet.

roles in supporting and participating in China's modernization, promoting Chinese culture, facilitating peace and unity of the country and deepening exchanges and cooperation between China and the world. Talking with residents and tourists at an old downtown area in Shantou, Xi said on the 40th anniversary of the SEZs, his visit to Shantou SEZ is a statement to both China and the international community that the CPC will lead the Chinese people in unswervingly following the path of reform and opening-up, working hard to advance socialist modernization, and striving to realize the Chinese

lodged solemn representations with the U.S. for imposing sanctions on Chinese personnel, said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday.China will take countermeasures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and relevant personnel if the United States insists on going down the wrong path, Zhao stressed.The U.S. State Department on Wednesday warned international financial institutions that if they were found doing business with relevant individuals in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, they could soon face tough sanctions.China urged the United States to correct its mistake and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way.The HKSAR government in a statement released on Thursday strongly opposed and condemned the report issued by the United States under the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Act, calling it groundless and irresponsible.Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society has regained stability, national security has been guaranteed in the city and residents can again enjoy basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, said the statement.The "sanctions" by the United States have no legal effect on financial institutions in Hong Kong, and the chief executive and other officials targeted by the U.S. have made it clear that they will continue to carry out their duty of safeguarding national security in Hong Kong in accordance with the law, the statement added.The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese foreign ministry in the HKSAR Thursday also expressed firm opposition to and solemnly refuted to the so-called report.A spokesperson of the office said the U.S. ignored the fact that Hong Kong is becoming more stable and better, and the mainstream public opinion is that Hong Kong society is regrouping and starting again, and the principle of international law of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries should be respected.The U.S. side concocted the so-called Law, defamed the national security law in Hong Kong, smeared the actions taken by the central government of China and the HKSAR government to set things right, imposed sanctions on officials of the central government of China and the HKSAR government, and propped up those who are anti-China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong. This has once again exposed the sinister intentions of the U.S. in its attempt to contain China's development, the spokesperson said. However, the wrong words and deeds of the U.S. cannot stop the steady and enduring growth of "One Country, Two Systems" and the prospect of Hong Kong's integration into the development of the country. The spokesperson stressed that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs.

They have also called for reforms to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.Thailand is technically still under a state of emergency as part of coronavirus restrictions.The police operation came after Prayuth declared a severe state of emergency in the Bangkok area to allow authorities to move against the protests. It bans unauthorized gatherings of more than five people.Before the police dispersal, a large number of protesters had already left the area after one of the their leaders announced the end of the rally at Government House though a few hundred stayed on. Protesters also announced that the rally would move to a different location in the capital Thursday afternoon, but deputy police spokesman Col.

Before leaving Democracy Monument, several small clashes broke out between protesters and their opponents, who traded punches and threw plastic bottles as police tried to keep them apart. The protest movement was launched in March by university students but quickly put on hold as Thailand was gripped by surges in coronavirus cases. It came back in July, when the threat from the virus eased, and since then has again been spearheaded by students and publicized on social media.The movement's original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year's general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party.

Protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule is undemocratic.(With inputs from AP)The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) naval and aerial forces closely followed the U.S. warship when it trespassed into China's Taiwan Straits on Wednesday, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said.The U.S. has taken a series of moves that sent misleading signal to those separatists on the island, Zhang said, warning the U.S. that it should stop sending the wrong signals.Zhang added that the Eastern Theater Command remains vigilant and will take all necessary means to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.(Cover image: Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, speaks at a press conference, April 16, 2019. /Xinhua)The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) naval and aerial forces closely followed the U.S. warship when it trespassed into China's Taiwan Straits on Wednesday, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said.The U.S. has taken a series of moves that sent misleading signal to those separatists on the island, Zhang said, warning the U.S. that it should stop sending the wrong signals.Zhang added that the Eastern Theater Command remains vigilant and will take all necessary means to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.(Cover image: Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, speaks at a press conference, April 16, 2019. /Xinhua)The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated Wednesday, as both sides exchanged accusations and claims of new attacks over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, where heavy fighting is continuing for a third week despite a Russia-brokered cease-fire deal.Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, emphasizing the need to respect the truce that was violated immediately after taking effect Saturday. Putin also voiced concern about the involvement in the conflict by militants from the Middle East â a reference to Turkey deploying Syrian fighters to combat Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.The two leaders "stressed the urgent need for joint efforts to end the bloodshed as soon as possible and move to a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem," according to a Kremlin readout of the call. Their first since fighting erupted late last month.In a sign that the conflict was widening, Azerbaijan's military said it destroyed an Armenian missile system on the territory of Armenia that was positioned to target civilian areas. Armenia's Defense Ministry responded by stating that it reserves the right to target Azerbaijani military objects and troop movements.So far, Armenia and Azerbaijan have denied targeting each other's territory in the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, although each of the parties often contested the denials.An expansion of hostilities could trigger a dangerous escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994. The Armenian forces have also controlled significant chunks of Azerbaijani territory outside the separatist region.The mutual accusations and threats raised concern about the safety of a strategic pipeline that carries Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea crude oil to Turkey and on to Western markets.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev threatened "very heavy response," should Armenia "carry out its plans to destroy" oil and gas pipelines in Azerbaijan.The failure of the truce that was supposed to begin Saturday reflects the uncompromising positions of the two South Caucasus nations that have stymied decades of diplomatic efforts. The escalation of fighting raises the specter of a wider conflict that could draw in Russia and Turkey and threaten Caspian Sea energy exports.Azerbaijan and Turkey have accepted Russia's mediation and grudgingly agreed to a truce, but they have made it clear that see the cease-fire as temporary until Armenia agrees to pull back its forces from Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey reiterated its support for Azerbaijan. Unlike previous outbursts of hostilities over Nagorno-Karabakh, NATO-member Turkey, which has close ethnic, cultural and historic bonds with Azerbaijan, vowed to help Azerbaijan reclaim its territory. Armenian officials say Turkey is directly involved in the conflict and is sending Syrian mercenaries to fight on Azerbaijan's side. Turkey has denied deploying combatants to the region, but a Syrian war monitor and Syria-based opposition activists have confirmed that Turkey has sent hundreds of Syrian opposition fighters to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh.Co-chaired by France, Russia and the United States, the OSCE Minsk Group has worked to find a resolution to the decades-long conflict, and the Kremlin said Wednesday that Putin and Erdogan hope Turkey will play a role towards de-escalation as a permanent member.Ongoing shelling by both sides has left a ceasefire agreed last week in Moscow hanging in the balance, but "both sides confirmed the importance of observing the humanitarian truce," the Kremlin said.(With inputs from agencies)The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated Wednesday, as both sides exchanged accusations and claims of new attacks over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, where heavy fighting is continuing for a third week despite a Russia-brokered cease-fire deal.Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, emphasizing the need to respect the truce that was violated immediately after taking effect Saturday.

But in a world ravaged by man-made and natural disasters, the UN food body soon became synonymous with survival for millions facing hunger and starvation. On October 9, the WFP's 17,000 employees were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for fighting a relentless war against hunger in conflict zones in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Speaking exclusively to CGTN Digital, the WFP's deputy executive director Amir Mahmoud Abdulla described the recognition as a "great honor" and "quite humbling."The Norwegian Nobel Committee lauded the WFP for its efforts in "preventing the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict."Calling hunger "the world's biggest solvable problem," Abdulla said the award raises the organization's profile and draws the world's attention toward the link between hunger and conflict, and hunger and COVID-19. "It's not just about being able to raise more resources â for us that's hugely important because we are a voluntarily funded organization â but what's important is that there's an attention of the world on this issue of hunger â hunger caused by conflict or people's lack of earning power. Both of those problems are solvable," he said, hoping that the acknowledgment will "move the world closer to a world of zero hunger."But the goal sounds more like a dream in pandemic-wracked 2020. In 2019, the WFP assisted more than 97 million people â the largest number since 2012 â in 88 countries. According to a WFP projection, the number of hungry people could double from 135 million in 2019 to 265 million by the end of 2020. The Global Report on Food Crisis published in April puts the figure for people facing chronic food insecurity at an astonishing 821 million.With fractured supply chains, restrictions on movement, and shrinking coffers of donor governments and financial institutions, the task of putting food in the plates of those who need it the most has become even more daunting."First of all, the impact on supply lines. When you had certain restrictions being put in place. Second, the ability of people to move. Our field and humanitarian workers are moving all over the world, and we are moving them around. So that created an issue. And those who we serve suddenly found themselves more stressed than usual because of the economic impact. Also, many casual workers found themselves out of work. We found that the numbers of people who needed assistance were increasing. All of these issues compounded as the WFP is a totally 100-percent voluntarily funded organization," Abdulla said.The WFP, one of world's largest humanitarian organizations tackling hunger and food insecurity, needs to raise $6.8 billion to avert the impacts of the coronavirus crisis. So far, the Nobel laureate body has only managed to bag $1.6 billion.Emphasizing that food security, peace and stability go hand in hand, Abdulla pointed out that 10 out of 13 food crises today are caused by conflict. "Longer-term developmental solutions are required. Solutions that would include helping smallholder farmers with their own agriculture, if there are people have lost their livelihood, then putting income generation or sort of livelihood schemes. So, it's a multi-faceted approach that requires more than just the World Food Programme. That's the one thing about the work we do, we need to that in partnership with many," he said.Talking about the food crisis in Yemen, Abdulla urged warring parties to allow unhindered access for humanitarian workers to get to the places they need to. "We have seen in certain parts of Yemen our inability to supply because we are unable to get the conditions that we need to be able to monitor and be absolutely sure that the right people were getting the food, or we just had no access at all. Neither our goods nor our people have been able get through. So, the only solution is constant dialogue. We never give up and we always continue to negotiate," he said.October 16 marks World Food Day, which is dedicated to addressing the problem of global hunger and malnutrition. According to the WFP, hunger isn't always a lack of food. "Climate change is something that we need to get to grips with for sure. There's also the aspect of food waste and food lost. What's really important to recognize is that there's food waste is often in developed countries and there's food loss is many countries where we serve. And that loss is when it's lost in fields before harvesting or lost in storage before harvesting," said Abdulla, adding "if we could manage the waste in developed countries and avoid the loss in developing countries, that combined food almost on its own would solve hunger."This year 107 organizations and 215 individuals were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, including the World Health Organization and 17-year-old celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg. But a "workable scheme" that began 59 years ago grabbed the Nobel glory."We have never lost sight of what we would really like to do and that is to go back to being an experiment that could actually say: 'The experiment is over, world hunger is solved. We don't need WFP.' If we get to that, then we can say it was a successful experiment. Now it remains a project in course, and as long as we are needed our staff will be out doing what they are needed to do," Abdulla concluded. The World Food Programme (WFP) was born out of an experiment in 1961.

The Trump administration cut funding to the Census Bureau. It has attempted to exclude undocumented immigrants and tried repeatedly to end the count ahead of schedule. Earlier this month, a federal judge issued an order stating the census could continue counting through the end of October.The COVID-19 pandemic also brought unprecedented problems with this year's population count. Coupled with roadblocks from the U.S. government, experts fear the census will be inaccurate and impact communities that already struggle with insufficient resources and representation.The goal of the census is to essentially count how many people live in a community. It's done every 10 years, and the data from the count determines how many congressional seats each states get in the House of Representatives and how much federal funding communities receive for education, healthcare and other public services. By ending it early, the New York Times reports, White House officials could use that data to their advantage.Minority groups and poor and young people who move frequently are often left out of the census or undercounted because they can be difficult to reach. These groups tend to live in urban areas that are often represented by Democrats. Ending the census early could deepen an undercount and "dilute" Democratic political representation, according to the New York Times.Because of COVID-19, the Census Bureau had previously received extensions for completing the count and turning in results. The deadline for finishing was pushed from the end of July to the end of October.In its push to end the count early, the Trump administration argued the Bureau would need to stop counting immediately so it could make the legal deadline of December 31 for delivering results to the president. The Trump administration would have the data needed to control representation in Congress, no matter who wins the presidential election.With the Supreme Court ruling, experts are not only concerned with undercounting and the politicization of the census but also an increase in distrust toward the bureau. Some are questioning the quality of this yearâs results and whether they can be trusted. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized," the key pacifist article in the constitution reads.Nevertheless, at the end of last month, Japan's Defense Ministry requested a record 5.49 trillion yen (about $52.17 billion) budget for the fiscal year starting in April 2021, with the request rising 3.3 percent from the initial budget for the current fiscal year through March 2021.With the ministry eyeing allocations for enhancing capabilities in outer space, cyberspace as well as financing for land-based infrastructure and hardware, Japan's defense spending under new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is looking set to rise for the ninth straight year.Japan on Wednesday unveiled its newest 3,000-ton submarine named Taigei which was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. amid no signs of the nation reining in its ever-increasing and constitutionally questionable "defense" spending.The submarine was unveiled at a shipyard in western Japan and is slated to go into service as the 22nd vessel in the Maritime Self-Defense Force's (MSDF) submarine fleet in March 2022.Tokyo has been planning to boost the number of its subs from 16 to 22 under plans laid out in its National Defense Program Guidelines in 2010, and Taigei, which means "big whale" in Japanese, will be able to house 70 crew members.The vessel is 84 meters in length and 9.1 meters in width and comes with a price tag of around 76 billion yen (about $722.23 million) to build, the MSDF said, adding that the incorporation of lithium-ion batteries allow the vessel to remain under water for longer than previous models.According to the MSDF, Japan currently operates nine 2,750-ton Oyashio-class submarines and 11 2,950-ton Soryu-class warships.The MSDF is planning to introduce a 12th Soryu-class sub next year, it said.As for the new Taigei, it will be the first in the new Taigei-class category following the Oyashio and Soryu, the MSDF explained.Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi, MSDF Chief of Staff Hiroshi Yamamura and around 150 others attended a ceremony Wednesday held at a Japanese defense equipment maker's Kobe Shipyard in Hyogo Prefecture.Japan is still bound by the constraints of its pacifist constitution, Article 9 of which states that the "Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.""In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.

It seems that those working in education can be sacrificed. It is also not possible to know where, to what extent the epidemic has spread, the trade union does not have access to the data," the union said.  Toni Waterman in BrusselsBelgium hit a new record of daily infections on Friday with 7,030 cases.  The average daily rate also continues to spike with more than 5,000 new cases recorded in the past week, up 93 percent from the previous period. Hospitals in Belgium are now bracing for a flood of COVID-19 patients. Medical facilities will go into phase 1A from today, meaning that 25 percent of intensive care unit beds are reserved for coronavirus patients.

Over the past four decades, Shenzhen has been transformed from a small fishing village into a modern metropolis with a permanent population of over 13 million. "The world economy is currently facing complicated challenges. By no means should we be stopped by the reversing trends and tides. We should choose the right side of the history to unswervingly expand opening-up in an all-round way, and promote the building of an open world economy and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind," Chinese President Xi Jinping told the gathering. At a time when the global economic recovery has been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-globalization sentiment, China in May this year brought to the table a new development pattern. Known as "dual circulation," it takes the domestic market as the mainstay while letting domestic and foreign markets boost each other. "The new development pattern is not a closed domestic circulation, but an open domestic and international dual circulation," Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed in the speech. He pointed out the need to explore a more flexible policy system and a more scientific management system in domestic and international trade, investment and financing, fiscal and tax affairs, financial innovation and border entry and exit. Shenzhen, a miracle in world development Shenzhen is a brand-new city created by the CPC and the Chinese people since the country's reform and opening-up and its development over the past 40 years is a miracle in the world development history, Xi said. Read more:Shenzhen at 40: A snapshot of landmarks over the years One small step for Shenzhen, one giant leap for China From 1980 to 2019, Shenzhen's GDP rose from 270 million yuan to 2.7 trillion yuan ($40 million to $400 billion), with an average annual growth rate of 20.7 percent, according to Xi. Its fiscal revenue also increased from less than 100 million yuan to 942.4 billion yuan ($14.9 million to $139.8 billion) during the period. Its total imports and exports climbed from $18 million in 1980 to $431.5 billion in 2019, an average annual growth rate of 26.1 percent, contributing to an all-around opening up, Xi summarized. People's livelihoods have also greatly improved in Shenzhen, with tremendous advancements in education, medical care, housing and other areas. Its per capita disposable income skyrocketed to 62,500 yuan ($9,272) in 2019, a 31.6-fold growth compared to that of 1985.Valuable experience Xi stressed the valuable experience from the development miracles of the special economic zones (SEZs) including Shenzhen. Below is some of the advice offered by the president: -- adhere to the concept that development is of paramount importance, insist on the practices of daring to try and daring to be the first, and pursue reform breakthroughs through creative thoughts. -- remain committed to opening-up on all fronts and continuously enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going out." -- take innovation as the primary driving force and win the upper hand in global technological revolution and industrial transformation. -- follow the people-centered philosophy of development to allow the people to benefit more from the achievements of reform and development in a fairer way. -- ensure scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality and universal law-abiding to make rule of law an important guarantee for the development of the SEZs. -- carry out the philosophy of "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets" to achieve sustained development of economy and society as well as ecology and environment in a comprehensive and coordinated way. -- implement the fundamental principle of "One Country, Two Systems" in a comprehensive and accurate way, and promote the integrated development of the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao. -- give full play to the leading and exemplary role of the SEZs while making overall plans for the country, so that they can contribute more to national development. 'Engine' for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hailing Shenzhen as an "engine" for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s development, Xi asked Shenzhen to take active moves to further promote the construction of the area and called for efforts to synergize economic rules and mechanisms in the three regions. The GBA Initiative was first mentioned in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and aims to combine the three regions in order to turn it into one of the world's top bay areas and world-class city clusters. Read more: Why is the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area crucial? The area encompasses the special administrative regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macao, as well as cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen in southern China's Guangdong Province. Local governments need to build regional railroads, allowing talents and goods to flow between the area more efficiently, which will improve market integration, said Xi. The country will deepen the reform and opening-up of the Qianhai-Shenzhen-Hong Kong pilot cooperation zone and speed up the construction of a comprehensive national science center in the GBA to enhance coordination and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao. The GBA's platform should be fully utilized to attract more young talents from Hong Kong and Macao to come to the region to study, work and build a life, providing them with a deeper and wider level of communication and understanding of each other, the president continued. Xi welcomed greater participation of foreign countries in the reform, opening-up and development of China's special economic zones.  He said foreign participation has been indispensable in building the economic zones over the past 40 years, assisting in the creation of vast development opportunities and offering development benefits for foreign countries.Continuous reform and wider opening-up were key terms in President Xi's speech at the grand gathering, or as some experts pointed out, the southern Chinese city is the best example that shows the need for further opening-up.Read more:CGTN Opinion: Wider opening-up a key takeaway from Xi's speech"As China's first special economic zone and through the launch of a market-driven scheme that supported the attraction of a large number of foreign investments, the city has become instrumental in making China a prominent player in today's global economy," commented Matteo Giovannini, a Beijing-based finance professional. The city is home to various leading Chinese tech companies, including telecoms giant Huawei and technology conglomerate Tencent, two of the major companies that the U.S. has been putting pressure on in the most recently souring China-U.S. ties. Some say President Xi's trip "soothes their nerves.""Xi's visit to Shenzhen and the unveiling of the plan are aimed to encourage the development of the tech industry," Chief Economist for Hang Seng Bank Dan Wang told South China Morning Post.According to Giovannini, the trip also shines a light at China's continuous determination to open its arms to the international community."(His trip) represents an opportunity to emphasize China's uninterrupted commitment to further domestic integration and market opening-up to the rest of the world," he said.China on Wednesday vowed to unswervingly expand the all-around opening-up of its economy as it held a grand gathering marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in this boomtown in southern Guangdong Province. On August 26, 1980, China's national legislature approved the establishment of special economic zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong Province and Xiamen in Fujian Province.

Known as "dual circulation," it takes the domestic market as the mainstay while letting domestic and foreign markets boost each other. "The new development pattern is not a closed domestic circulation, but an open domestic and international dual circulation," Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed in the speech. He pointed out the need to explore a more flexible policy system and a more scientific management system in domestic and international trade, investment and financing, fiscal and tax affairs, financial innovation and border entry and exit. Shenzhen, a miracle in world development Shenzhen is a brand-new city created by the CPC and the Chinese people since the country's reform and opening-up and its development over the past 40 years is a miracle in the world development history, Xi said. Read more:Shenzhen at 40: A snapshot of landmarks over the years One small step for Shenzhen, one giant leap for China From 1980 to 2019, Shenzhen's GDP rose from 270 million yuan to 2.7 trillion yuan ($40 million to $400 billion), with an average annual growth rate of 20.7 percent, according to Xi. Its fiscal revenue also increased from less than 100 million yuan to 942.4 billion yuan ($14.9 million to $139.8 billion) during the period. Its total imports and exports climbed from $18 million in 1980 to $431.5 billion in 2019, an average annual growth rate of 26.1 percent, contributing to an all-around opening up, Xi summarized. People's livelihoods have also greatly improved in Shenzhen, with tremendous advancements in education, medical care, housing and other areas. Its per capita disposable income skyrocketed to 62,500 yuan ($9,272) in 2019, a 31.6-fold growth compared to that of 1985.Valuable experience Xi stressed the valuable experience from the development miracles of the special economic zones (SEZs) including Shenzhen. Below is some of the advice offered by the president: -- adhere to the concept that development is of paramount importance, insist on the practices of daring to try and daring to be the first, and pursue reform breakthroughs through creative thoughts. -- remain committed to opening-up on all fronts and continuously enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going out." -- take innovation as the primary driving force and win the upper hand in global technological revolution and industrial transformation. -- follow the people-centered philosophy of development to allow the people to benefit more from the achievements of reform and development in a fairer way. -- ensure scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality and universal law-abiding to make rule of law an important guarantee for the development of the SEZs. -- carry out the philosophy of "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets" to achieve sustained development of economy and society as well as ecology and environment in a comprehensive and coordinated way. -- implement the fundamental principle of "One Country, Two Systems" in a comprehensive and accurate way, and promote the integrated development of the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao. -- give full play to the leading and exemplary role of the SEZs while making overall plans for the country, so that they can contribute more to national development. 'Engine' for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hailing Shenzhen as an "engine" for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s development, Xi asked Shenzhen to take active moves to further promote the construction of the area and called for efforts to synergize economic rules and mechanisms in the three regions. The GBA Initiative was first mentioned in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and aims to combine the three regions in order to turn it into one of the world's top bay areas and world-class city clusters. Read more: Why is the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area crucial? The area encompasses the special administrative regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macao, as well as cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen in southern China's Guangdong Province. Local governments need to build regional railroads, allowing talents and goods to flow between the area more efficiently, which will improve market integration, said Xi. The country will deepen the reform and opening-up of the Qianhai-Shenzhen-Hong Kong pilot cooperation zone and speed up the construction of a comprehensive national science center in the GBA to enhance coordination and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao. The GBA's platform should be fully utilized to attract more young talents from Hong Kong and Macao to come to the region to study, work and build a life, providing them with a deeper and wider level of communication and understanding of each other, the president continued. Xi welcomed greater participation of foreign countries in the reform, opening-up and development of China's special economic zones.  He said foreign participation has been indispensable in building the economic zones over the past 40 years, assisting in the creation of vast development opportunities and offering development benefits for foreign countries.Continuous reform and wider opening-up were key terms in President Xi's speech at the grand gathering, or as some experts pointed out, the southern Chinese city is the best example that shows the need for further opening-up.Read more:CGTN Opinion: Wider opening-up a key takeaway from Xi's speech"As China's first special economic zone and through the launch of a market-driven scheme that supported the attraction of a large number of foreign investments, the city has become instrumental in making China a prominent player in today's global economy," commented Matteo Giovannini, a Beijing-based finance professional. The city is home to various leading Chinese tech companies, including telecoms giant Huawei and technology conglomerate Tencent, two of the major companies that the U.S. has been putting pressure on in the most recently souring China-U.S. ties. Some say President Xi's trip "soothes their nerves.""Xi's visit to Shenzhen and the unveiling of the plan are aimed to encourage the development of the tech industry," Chief Economist for Hang Seng Bank Dan Wang told South China Morning Post.According to Giovannini, the trip also shines a light at China's continuous determination to open its arms to the international community."(His trip) represents an opportunity to emphasize China's uninterrupted commitment to further domestic integration and market opening-up to the rest of the world," he said.Since the Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire went into effect on Saturday, Armenia and Azerbaijan have exchanged recriminations, seriously violating the agreement that was meant to quell fighting over the disputed region.Azerbaijan's defense ministry said it was open to the temporary humanitarian ceasefire agreed in Moscow to exchange prisoners and bodies of those killed in the fighting. It insisted that Azeri forces were not violating the truce and accused Armenian forces of breaching the agreement by shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy, Aghdam and Terter. Armenia denied the accusation and said Azerbaijan had resumed military operations "supported by active artillery fire in the southern, northern, northeastern and eastern directions."Meantime, the death toll in the conflict continues to rise. Officials at the Nagorno-Karabakh region said 532 servicemen had been killed so far, seven since Monday. Azerbaijan has reported 42 Azeri civilian deaths and 206 others wounded since the fighting erupted on September 27. It has not disclosed military casualties.With sporadic shelling reported and daily recriminations regarding serious alleged violations of the Moscow-brokered agreement, the unrestrained battle has drawn warnings from international groups of a humanitarian crisis.Read more: Reported shelling haunts Nagorno-Karabakh, dims ceasefireMartin Schuepp, Eurasia regional director for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said his organization was in "continuous discussions" to facilitate the handover of detainees or bodies of those killed, but because of the security situation, the ICRC has not been possible to access all locations that might have been affected.Schuepp said the ICRC is appealing for another 10.1 million U.S. dollars to fund its humanitarian efforts in the region, as tens of thousands of people potentially need help in coming months.The conflict is also worsening the spread of COVID-19, World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a United Nations briefing in Geneva.Armenia's new COVID-19 cases had doubled over the 14 days up to Monday, while new infections were up approximately 80 percent over the past week in Azerbaijan, Jasarevic told.The Russia-brokered truce is buckling despite mounting calls from world powers to halt the fighting. The Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group, a committee set up by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, to help mediate in Nagorno-Karabakh released its latest statement on Tuesday, calling on the Armenian and Azeri leaders to "take immediate steps to execute in full the obligations of the sides according to the October 10 Moscow statement," to prevent catastrophic consequences for the region.The Co-Chairs reiterated that civilian casualties are unacceptable under any circumstances.The 11-member group is led by the U.S., Russia and France. Turkey is also a member but not involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh talks, though it has said it wants to join them.Read more: Unremitting Nagorno-Karabakh fighting dents fragile ceasefireTurkey and Armenia have each blamed the other for exacerbating the crisis around Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but governed and populated by ethnic Armenians.Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he believed that only a change in Turkey's stance on Nagorno-Karabakh could prompt Azerbaijan to halt military action over the tiny region."I'm convinced that for as long as Turkey's position remains unchanged, Azerbaijan will not stop fighting," Pashinyan said. He accused Turkey of sabotaging the ceasefire and of trying to muscle its way into the wider South Caucasus region to further what he called its expansionist ambitions.Since fighting flared on September 27, Turkey has backed Azerbaijan strongly and said Armenian forces must leave the enclave.Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday that the demands for a ceasefire were "reasonable" and the international community should ask Armenia to withdraw from Azeri territory.Turkey has been widely accused of dispatching pro-Ankara Syrian militia to assist Baku, a claim denied by both Turkey and Azerbaijan. According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 1,450 such fighters have gone to Azerbaijan including 250 in the last week alone.In a phone call on Monday with his Turkish counterpart, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu raised the issue of Syrian fighters, and on Tuesday, Russia warned of the possible transfer of Syrian militants from the Middle East to Nagorno-Karabakh.Read more: Armenia's PM says ready for 'mutual concessions' with Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh(With input from agencies)Since the Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire went into effect on Saturday, Armenia and Azerbaijan have exchanged recriminations, seriously violating the agreement that was meant to quell fighting over the disputed region.Azerbaijan's defense ministry said it was open to the temporary humanitarian ceasefire agreed in Moscow to exchange prisoners and bodies of those killed in the fighting.

They also claimed the probe is politically motivated. Previously, Trump's lawyers argued that the subpoena should be blocked because the president has immunity from prosecution. That argument was rejected three times, including by the Supreme Court in July. Ahead of the November 3 election, the New York Times reported last month that Trump paid just 750 U.S. dollars in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, a claim the president denies. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday filed an emergency request to the Supreme Court to block his tax records from a New York grand jury subpoena, The Hill reports.The latest development marks the second time that the president has asked the court to stop Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance from accessing his tax records spanning eight years.The president's lawyers asked the court to block a federal appeals court ruling that said a subpoena of his tax records can proceed. "Irreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay," his lawyers wrote in their appeal to the Supreme Court. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance wants the returns, which cover 2011 to 2018, as part of an investigation into Trump's business affairs. The prosecutor is investigating possible tax evasion, insurance fraud and falsification of accounts. Vance is also seeking the records in connection with an alleged hush money payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels. U.S. presidents are not required by law to release details of their personal finances, but every U.S. leader since Richard Nixon has done so. Trump has broken with this tradition. His lawyers claim that the subpoena is too broad for the scope of the investigation.

The U.S. intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy," he said.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country, said the envoy."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he added."China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail," Geng added.The ambassador emphasized that China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process."Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," he noted.China has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, said the envoy."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council) country who has made such commitments," Geng noted."China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5," the ambassador stressed.The First Committee, also known as the Disarmament and International Security Committee, is one of six main committees of the UNGA. It deals with disarmament and international security matters.The committee meets every year in October for a 4-5 week session, after the UNGA General Debate. All 193 member states of the United Nations can attend.Statement of H. E. Mr. Geng Shuang, Head of the Chinese Delegation and Deputy Permanent Representative at the General Debate of the First Committee of the 75th Session of the UNGA(From Chinese Mission to the United Nations)2020/10/12Mr. Chairman,First of all, please allow me to extend, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, my congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as Chairman of the First Committee of the current session of the UN General Assembly. The Chinese delegation wishes to assure you and other delegations of its full support and cooperation to make this session of the committee a full success.Mr. Chairman,The global strategic security and arms control situation today is faced with the gravest challenge since the Cold War. To maintain its supremacy as the sole super power, the US has reverted to the Cold War mentality, hyped up major power competition and stoked major power confrontation. These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability.For the past years, to develop military capabilities without constraint, the US has continuously withdrawn from international treaties, sabotaging the multilateral and bilateral arms control and disarmament regime built up gradually after the WWII. The US is investing trillions of US dollars to modernize its nuclear Triad, developing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, and expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence. The US has also lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, and even discussed the resumption of nuclear tests. We urge the US to faithfully fulfill its special and primary responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, positively respond to Russia's appeal for the extension of the New START Treaty, and further substantially reduce its nuclear arsenal, so as to create conditions for other Nuclear Weapon States to join multilateral nuclear disarmament.The unrestrained development and deployment of a global missile defense system by the US as well as its attempts to deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, not only pose threats to China's security, but also undermine regional peace and security and disrupt global strategic stability. China is gravely concerned and urges the US to stop relevant deployments. Should the US continue to go down this path, China will take forceful countermeasures in defense of its own national interests when necessary.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. At present, the US has gone to extremes to shift responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, exercise double standards in violation of international law on non-proliferation issues, and manipulate the peaceful use of nuclear energy for political purposes, putting all the three pillars of the NPT under unprecedented strain. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of NPT, China calls on all parties to take this as an opportunity to reaffirm the treaty obligations and commitments made in the outcome documents of previous review conferences, and work for progress on the three pillars of NPT in a balanced manner. address the differences and disputes constructively, so as to achieve pragmatic outcomes at the 10th Review Conference.Recently the US named China as "the third largest nuclear power on earth", hyped up "nuclear arms race between the US, Russia and China" and proposed so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation". This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community. The US intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country. Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the US and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation. China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail.China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process. Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China has declared the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Non-Nuclear-Weapon States or Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones. China is the only P5 country who makes such commitments. China firmly abides by its commitments on the moratorium of nuclear tests, and supports the development of the verification mechanism of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). China supports negotiation for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of a comprehensive and balanced program of work in accordance with the mandate contained in the Shannon Report, and supports the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification. China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5.In the face of the increasingly complex and ominous international security landscape, the P5 should take proactive measures to manage differences, and work together to maintain global strategic stability. Since the Beijing Conference in January last year, the P5 have reached consensus on carrying out cooperation on strategic security issues including nuclear doctrines and policies, nuclear risk reduction, etc. China suggests that the P5 continue to strengthen dialogue on nuclear policies and doctrines, jointly reiterate that "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought", make a commitment not to target their nuclear weapons at any State, commit to the no-first-use of nuclear weapons unconditionally, and conclude legally binding international instruments on providing negative and positive security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States. We urge the US to abandon the policies of nuclear umbrella and nuclear sharing, withdraw all the nuclear weapons deployed overseas, stop the development and deployment of its global missile defense system, and play a due role in improving international and regional security environment.Mr. Chairman,The root cause of the current tensions related to the Iran nuclear issue is the US unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, re-imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran, and blocking other parties from fulfilling their obligations under the JCPOA. Having withdrawn from the JCPOA, the US has no right to trigger the Security Council snap-back mechanism, and its unilateral announcement on restoration of the UNSC sanctions against Iran has no legal validity whatsoever. It is imperative that all relevant parties resolve differences over the implementation of the JCPOA through dialogue and consultation within the framework of the Joint Commission focusing on restoring the balance of rights and obligations. China attaches high importance to the concerns of relevant parties over regional security issues, and advocates, on the premise of preserving the JCPOA, the establishment of an alternative multilateral dialogue platform with the purpose of building new consensus on maintaining peace and stability in the region.The US bears the responsibility for the deadlock of the DPRK-US dialogue regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. China urges the US to show sincerity and respond with concrete actions to the DPRK's legitimate concerns over security and development, so as to bring the Peninsular nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue. China is committed to upholding the denuclearization, peace and stability of the Peninsula, and to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation. China is firmly opposed to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction beyond the mandates of the UNSC resolutions and to any attempt by forces outside the region to use the Peninsula issue as an excuse to beef up military deployment in the region. China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.Mr. Chairman,The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has sounded the alarm on bio-security and highlighted the importance and urgency of strengthening global bio-security governance. In this connection, China wishes to make the following points. First, all parties should faithfully fulfill their due obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The international community is highly concerned with the US military's biological programs. We urge the US to act in an open, transparent and responsible manner and fully clarify its activities in numerous bio-labs overseas. Second, efforts should be made to resume negotiation for a verification protocol under BWC framework in order to put in place an effective international verification mechanism for the sake of safeguarding bio-security. We hope that such a decision can be made at next year's BWC Review Conference. We once again urge the US to stop impeding the resumption of negotiation. Third, it is necessary to set up a scientific advisory body within the framework of BWC and develop a voluntary code of conduct, in order to better regulate bio-research activities and promote the sound development of bio-technologies. Fourth, it is time to establish a fair and inclusive non-proliferation, export control and international cooperation regime under the framework of the BWC, remove discriminatory barriers, ensure developing countries' rights to the dividends of bio-technologies and jointly lift global bio-security to a new level.As the only possessor of chemical weapon stockpile, the US should earnestly fulfill its obligations under the CWC and expedite the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. In dealing with the Syrian chemical weapons issue, the provisions of CWC should be strictly observed and the authority of the Convention should be upheld. China strongly opposes political manipulation of the issue by a small number of countries for geopolitical purposes.Mr. Chairman,With the rapid development of digital economy, prominent risks associated with data security require global solutions. What is pressing now is to develop a set of international rules on data security that reflect the will and respect the interests of most countries on the basis of universal participation. China rejects attempts of the US and some other countries to politicize the issue of data security, elbow out countries with different views in the name of the so-called Clean Network program, and prey on enterprises of other countries under the pretext of security.China has recently put forward the Global Initiative on Data Security with a view to addressing data security risks and challenges, safeguarding global data and supply chain security, and promoting digital economic development and cooperation. China's initiative calls on all states to oppose using ICT activities to impair other States' critical infrastructure or steal important data, oppose abusing ICT to conduct mass surveillance against other States, desist from requesting domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in one's own territory, and ask ICT products and services providers not to install back-doors in their products and services. China's initiative aims to serve as a basis for international rules-making on data security, and is also a commitment of China to safeguarding global data security. China hopes that all parties could support this initiative, and we are open to good ideas and suggestions from all sides. China supports the work of the UN OEWG and UN GGE and hope that these processes will make further progress.The current security situation in outer space is increasingly challenging. In particular, the US has been pursuing a strategy for dominance in space, blatantly termed outer space as a new war-fighting domain, and has even established an independent Space Force and the Space Command. The US also plans to deploy missile defense system in outer space. These US moves accelerate the militarization and weaponization of outer space and therefore are the most prominent factors affecting outer space security. China urges the US to stop impeding international arms control process on outer space, and join international efforts for negotiation and conclusion of an international legal instrument based on the draft PPWT proposed by China and Russia, so as to fundamentally safeguard lasting peace and common security in outer space.The rapid development of the military application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may give rise to security, humanitarian, legal and ethical concerns. Paying high attention to these issues, China is supportive of having in-depth international discussions aimed at exploring effective measures to address the associated risks and ensuring that AI technology will benefit all mankind. China also supports continued in-depth discussions on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) within the framework of Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), with the purpose of negotiating a legally-binding international instrument.Mr. Chairman,China acceded to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) on 6 July this year. This is a significant step taken by China in its active efforts to promote global arms trade governance and to safeguard international and regional peace and security. This testifies to China's sincerity in upholding multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind. As a State Party to the ATT, China will faithfully fulfill its obligations, and work closely with all parties to promote the universality and effectiveness of the ATT. In this connection, China is ready to provide assistance to the developing countries within its capacity. China attaches great importance to African concerns about the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, and supports the African Union's initiative of "Silencing the Guns in Africa". To this end, China has provided USD 1.4 million through the United Nations Peace and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019. Standing ready to carry out further cooperation with the AU and African countries in this regard, China also calls upon the international community to provide needed assistance to Africa. Meanwhile, we urge all countries to stop arms sales to non-state actors, and refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign states through arms exports.Mr. Chairman,No matter how grave the international security situation may become, as long as we stay committed to upholding multilateralism, strengthening mutual trust and coordination centered on the UN, and building a community with a shared future for mankind, we would be able to make progress in international arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation. China is ready to join hands with other members of the international community to make unremitting efforts towards this end.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.A Chinese envoy said on Monday that asking China to participate in the "trilateral arms control negotiation" is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible.Geng Shuang, head of the Chinese delegation and deputy permanent representative of China to the United Nations, rejected the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" recently hyped up by the United States, in his statement delivered at the general debate of the First Committee of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).Geng pointed out that recently the United States named China as "the third largest nuclear power on Earth," hyped up "nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia and China" and proposed the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation.""This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community.

China is ready to join hands with other members of the international community to make unremitting efforts towards this end.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi hailed Serbia as a "true and great friend" after meeting President Aleksandar Vucic and his leading ministers.Yang Jiechi also praised Serbia's economic development and said China would continue to encourage its companies to invest in Serbia and help to maintain its economic growth. The two nations have established an increasingly close relationship, with Serbia receiving large shipments of medical aid from China to help its fight against COVID-19.Now, Yang Jiechi says the focus of the two nations is to map out their future economic relationship, which he believes will benefit both parties.  "Regarding practical cooperation between China and Serbia, it is proven to be mutually beneficial," he said. "For instance, Smederevo steel mill is one of the examples of joint victory."In 2016, Serbia's only steel mill was saved from bankruptcy by the Chinese HBIS group. Thanks to that intervention, over 12,000 workers kept their jobs.However, amid uncertain progress in EU membership talks, Serbia is also courting the U.S. as it seeks international allies, placing it in the middle of tense relations between east and west.  Vucic recently visited Washington to sign an agreement with the U.S. vowing not to use 5G equipment from "suspicious sources." This came just weeks after the U.S. banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, claiming it could compromise national security.Vucic said: "We already had various pressures and we know it is not easy to maintain a friendship with China. But so far, Serbia [has been] successful in maintaining it. We'll keep our freedom of choices, and we'll continue to build a sincere friendship with the People's Republic of China."    Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi hailed Serbia as a "true and great friend" after meeting President Aleksandar Vucic and his leading ministers.Yang Jiechi also praised Serbia's economic development and said China would continue to encourage its companies to invest in Serbia and help to maintain its economic growth. The two nations have established an increasingly close relationship, with Serbia receiving large shipments of medical aid from China to help its fight against COVID-19.Now, Yang Jiechi says the focus of the two nations is to map out their future economic relationship, which he believes will benefit both parties.  "Regarding practical cooperation between China and Serbia, it is proven to be mutually beneficial," he said.

However, some high-profile cases involving violent crimes committed by underage youths in recent years have sparked a heated debate on the minimum age of criminal liability.Besides, statistics from the country's top procuratorate raised concerns over juvenile crimes. China saw a rebound in juvenile delinquency in recent years, according to a white paper issued by the SPP.From 2014 to 2017, the number of juvenile arrests examined by procuratorial agencies dropped from 56,276 to 42,413, later increasing by 5.87 percent and 7.51 percent in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The number of juvenile prosecutions increased 5.12 percent year on year in 2019.The most common juvenile crimes prosecuted were theft, robbery, intentional assault, affray, creating disturbances and rape, accounting for about 82.28 percent of the total, the white paper showed.During the five-day session, lawmakers will also review draft laws on biosecurity, export control, Yangtze River conservation, veterans support, personal information protection, and coast guard.They are also expected to deliberate a draft amendment to the Patent Law, a draft revision to the Law on the Protection of Minors, draft amendments to the National Flag Law and the National Emblem Law, a draft amendment to the Criminal Law and a draft revision to the Administrative Penalty Law.A draft amendment to the Electoral Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses, a draft revision to the Wildlife Protection Law and a draft revision to the National Defense Law will also be reviewed, according to the agenda.Protect personal informationAccording to a draft law on personal information protection submitted for the first reading at the Standing Committee of the NPC's ongoing session, personal consent should be obtained on the premise of prior notification for handling private information and individuals have the right to withdraw their consent.The draft added that when important issues are changed, personal consent shall be obtained again.No product or service shall be denied on the ground of personal disagreement, the draft noted.Before processing personal information, the data processor shall inform the individual of matters such as the identity and contact information of the processor, the purpose and method of processing, the type of personal information to be processed and the retention period, all in a conspicuous way and in clear and easy-to-understand language, the draft required.By March 2020, China had 900 million internet users, more than 4 million websites and more than 3 million applications, according to an introduction of the draft law.Personal information protection has become one of the most important and practical issues for everyday people, said the introduction.Strengthen guardian responsibility in protecting minorsChinese lawmakers on Tuesday also began reviewing a draft revision of the Law on the Protection of Minors, in a move to strengthen the responsibility of guardians in protecting minors.The latest draft of the revision adds stipulations that parents or guardians should provide the minors in their care with a safe family living environment and promptly eliminate potential safety hazards that could lead to electrical shock, scalding, falling or injury.Guardians should also take measures to prevent minors from being injured in traffic accidents, such as providing child safety seats and teaching minors to abide by traffic rules.The draft also makes provisions on protecting minors in cyberspace, stating that the processing of personal information of minors under the age of 14 will require the consent of their parents or other guardians. According to the draft, internet service providers should take measures such as disconnecting links to stop online bullying and the dissemination of information harmful to the physical and mental health of minors, and report to relevant authorities. (With input from Xinhua)Chinese lawmakers are mulling over lowering the minimum age at which a minor can be convicted to 12, in individual cases under specific circumstances.The proposal was made in a draft amendment to the Criminal Law, which was submitted Tuesday to the ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.The Standing Committee of the 13th NPC started its 22nd session Tuesday to review multiple draft laws and law revisions.If a juvenile, who has reached the age of 12 but is under 14, commits intentional homicide or inflicts an injury that leads to death under flagrant circumstances, he or she shall bear criminal responsibility upon attestation and approval of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), according to the draft.Currently, minors under the age of 14 do not bear any criminal responsibility in China.

It's one of few key states in the age of mass mail-in voting likely to report on November 3, and if Biden wins its 29 Electoral College votes, the election will be as good as over.CGTN analysis of public polling indicates the former vice president is up by 3.4 points in Florida and over eight points nationally, with female, older and suburban voters moving towards him. Biden has built up a lead with seniors, the most reliable voting bloc, as the pandemic has progressed.While the first presidential debate looks to have hurt Trump in the polls, the only lasting impact from the vice-presidential clash between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Mike Pence is the slew of memes that emerged after a fly perched for two minutes on the vice president's head.Snap polls suggested Harris was the winner of a low-key debate which was quickly forgotten as the president returned to center stage. Whether Biden and Trump will square up again in person remains unclear â the president has refused to debate virtually and so the second event, scheduled for this week, has been cancelled.The third planned debate, now the second, is still due to go ahead on October 22 and could be the final opportunity for Trump to try to knock the risk-averse Biden campaign off course.Video: Wang Zengzheng and Zhou TingyuScript: John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.With three weeks until election day in the United States more than 10 million Americans have already voted and CGTN analysis suggests Joe Biden has pulled further ahead of Donald Trump in the national polls.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionHere are the highlights from the past seven days.Trump returned to the White House after his COVID-19 hospitalization, released a series of videos, conducted phone or recorded interviews with Fox News, addressed a crowd on the South Lawn on Saturday, and then got into a spat with Anthony Fauci before returning to the campaign trail in Florida on Monday.The president, desperate to return to in-person events, insisted he was "immune" from the virus on Sunday in a tweet which was flagged for spreading "misleading and potentially harmful information" as the U.S. continued to report over 40,000 new COVID-19 cases per day.Confirmation of a negative test did not come until Trump was en route to Monday's rally, the first of a series of swing state campaign stops â Axios reported that the Republican wants to hold a rally every day until November 3.Polling numbers for Trump have gone from bad to worse since the first presidential debate and his COVID-19 diagnosis.Seemingly low on funds, the president's campaign is cutting advertising spending and hoping for a free media boost from rallies just as Biden, flush with cash, broadens his own ad buys: the Democrat splashed out $40 million to Trump's $23 million over the past week.Florida is yet again shaping up to be the race to watch.

negotiation" with the U.S. and Russia as the U.S. intends to avoid its own responsibility in nuclear disarmament.  The U.S. named China "the third largest nuclear power on Earth," hyped up the "nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia and China" and proposed the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation," which is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community, said Geng, the head of the Chinese delegation and deputy permanent representative of China to the United Nations.Speaking during the general debate of the First Committee of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), Geng called the trilateral arms control talks "coercion" and "blackmail," saying China will never be part of such negotiation. China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in a nuclear arms race with any other country, Geng said."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he continued.But the Chinese representative said China is pursuing its responsibility to push forward nuclear disarmament.China signed the UN-led Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) spurned by the U.S. in July, Geng noted, saying it's a "significant" step taken by his country.The ATT regulates a 70 billion-U.S.-dollar global cross-border trade in conventional arms and seeks to keep weapons out of the hands of human rights abusers.Then-U.S. President Barack Obama's administration signed it, but it was opposed by the National Rifle Association and never ratified by the U.S. Senate.In July 2019, the United States told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that Washington did not intend to become a party to the treaty and that it had no legal obligations from its 2013 signature.Naming the United States, Geng said the U.S. is reverted to the Cold War mentality and launched acts of unilateralism and confrontation."These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability."Geng noted that China has provided $1.4 million through the United Nations Peace and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019 to help reduce illicit trafficking of small weapons in African countries.China also has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, Geng said."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council)

He said earlier this year that China must stick to the path of self-reliance as international unilateralism and trade protectionism was rising."Regardless of the past, present and future, we must put the development of the country and the nation on the basis of our own strength, adhere to national self-esteem and self-confidence and unswervingly walk our own path," said Xi.But that doesn't mean the doors to China will close as Xi stressed at last year's China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, "At a new historical starting point, China will open its door only wider to the world."Read more: Xi's CIIE speech: China will open its door only widerIn recent years the U.S. has put extreme pressure so as to contain the rise of Chinese tech firms, through all-out efforts to cut chips supply to such companies as Huawei and SMIC, and enforce bans on apps like TikTok and WeChat. However, analysts said Washington's restrictions have rather pushed China onto a more independent approach on high technologies.More than 8.8 million Americans have already voted in the U.S. presidential election.Based off data released by states that have started accepting ballots, more registered Democrats are voting early compared to Republicans.Officials from both parties say Democrats are far more eager to vote early to avoid possibly exposing themselves to the virus at Election Day polling sites. Many Republicans have followed the lead of President Donald Trump, who has regularly castigated voting by mail, while the party's leadership in some states has offered mixed messages about when supporters should vote.While millions of people are choosing to vote by mail this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, others are opting for in-person early voting.Recent controversies including criticism by the Trump administration over the U.S. Postal Service and doubts about the acceptance of ballots are leading some to head to the polls in-person. In Virginia, early voting began September 28th. Officials say election workers are receiving about 2,000 mail-in ballots per day and hundreds are lining up to vote in-person. More than 890,000 people have already cast ballots by voting in person, by mail or drop box."We're probably looking at three times the rate for early voting that we saw in 2016," said Gary D. Scott, the head of the office of elections in Fairfax County, to the Washington Post."I want to make sure that my ballot didn't get torn up, that it didn't get thrown away, and that there wasn't anything going on at the polls that shouldn't be going on there," Linda Cottrell told the Los Angeles Times.Early voting began October 7th in Arizona. The LA Times reports, fear was a common factor among reasons why people decided to vote early. Voters were worried their mail-in ballots wouldnât arrive on time, get lost or election officials would stop counting.In Georgia, early in-person voting began Monday. Thousands of people turned out in long lines. Voters in Fulton County faced technical glitches that temporarily stopped voting but officials were able to clear the lines by mid-morning.CNN reports the state of Ohio has received almost 2.2 million ballot requests... double those from early October 2016.Considering millions have already cast their votes early, experts predict a record turnout for the election. National opinion polls show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the lead over Trump. But as officials brace for an influx of mail-in ballots compared to previous elections, they are also warning, Americans might not have a final result by the end of the night on November 3rd. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

Pubs and bars will close temporarily and socializing prohibited indoors, but universities and retail shops will stay open.High level measures will be applied to Manchester and Nottinghamshire, meaning socializing indoors will be banned and the rule of six applied in outdoor settings, but pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open, as across the rest of the country, until 10 p.m.  Those areas placed on the medium tier will continue to follow national guidelines, with bars and pubs closing at 10 p.m. and the rule of six applied outdoors.The UK government response is for England only, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland implementing their own strategies to deal with the pandemic.Johnson says the new system is designed to avoid another national lockdown, which he says would cause long-term economic damage."This is not how we want to live our lives," he said. "But it is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic costs of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."  Johnson added: "The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country. I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed."The prime minister and his scientific advisers will continue to monitor the number of cases in each area, which could lead to an increasing number of towns and cities facing the most severe measures.England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained why cases of COVID-19 have risen so sharply the north of England compared with the rest of the country. "The epidemic this time has clearly picked up pace in the north of England earlier than it did in the first wave and that almost certainly relates to the fact that disease levels in the north never dropped, and certainly in the northwest, they never dropped as far as they dropped in the summer as they did in the south."Johnson also announced a further economic package would be introduced to replace the furlough scheme, which comes to an end at the end of this month. The support will cover two-thirds of the wages for employees of businesses forced to close as a result of the new virus restrictions.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a new three-level COVID-19 alert system across England as cases continue to rise across the country.Infection rates have quadrupled in England in the past month, and hospital admissions have doubled. The new system will apply localized measures of varying severity to the worst-hit areas of the country, with regions placed into one of three levels â medium, high or very high. Liverpool has been placed in the very high level with measures set to be imposed from Wednesday.

establishing a republic following the abrupt departure abroad of former King Juan Carlos amid a cloud of scandal, according to an opinion poll.The 82-year-old former monarch has been living in the United Arab Emirates since he left Spain in August to avoid causing further embarrassment to his son, King Felipe VI.Of the respondents, 40.9 percent said they preferred a republic, while 34.9 percent said they supported the royal family and 24.2 percent said they did not know, according to the survey for the Platform for Independent Media, a group of mainly left-wing media.The poll, which questioned 3,000 people, also found 48 percent want a referendum on the monarchy, which under Spain's constitution is the only way to decide the fate of the institution, while 25 percent were opposed and 16.1 percent did not know.  A poll published in August for the pro-monarchy ABC newspaper found 33.5 percent favouring a republic and 56 percent the monarchy, while six percent did not know and 4.1 percent were indifferent.While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos could become a target in two inquiries in Spain and Switzerland into alleged corruption associated with a $9.9 billion, high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms.Spain's supreme court prosecutor is considering whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to formally involve Juan Carlos.The former king has not commented publicly but his lawyer Javier Sanchez has said he is at the disposition of prosecutors if necessary.  The latest survey, published on the National Day public holiday when King Felipe will lead a reduced celebration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was commissioned after the government's Centre for Sociological Investigations declined to question Spaniards about the monarchy in its most recent poll.Defence Minister Margarita Robles said the monarchy was an "essential part of the constitutional pact," speaking in an interview published on Monday in ABC.Nobel laureate Maria Vargas Llosa was among 183 high-profile supporters of the monarchy who posted a video on YouTube on Sunday in support of King Felipe.More than 40 percent of Spaniards support

Reuters reported on Wednesday, though the Chinese mainland has repeatedly warned the U.S. to stop the deal.Citing Pentagon, Reuters said the U.S. State Department had approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan authorities, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion.Last week, the White House said they were moving forward with five separate sales of sophisticated military equipment to the island with a total value of around $5 billion.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin Corp, called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing Co, for an estimated $1 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow Wednesday's, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defense cruise missiles.Sources have said the 100 cruise missiles stations and 400 missiles would have a cost of about $2 billion.The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales, but Reuters said this is unlikely given broad bipartisan support for Taiwan.China has repeatedly warned the U.S. not to move forward the arms sales as the two countries' relations are under strain since the COVID-19 pandemic.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said last week that U.S. arms sales to China's Taiwan region severely damaged China's sovereignty and security interests.The United States is seriously violating the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, especially the August 17 communique, by selling arms to Taiwan, thereby seriously interfering in China's internal affairs, Zhao said in a daily briefing on October 13.He urged Washington to cancel the planned sales and warned that China would make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops.The U.S. State Department has formally notified the Congress of the planned

on Wednesday the State Department was designating six more China-based media companies in the U.S. as foreign missions, despite China's opposition.Previously in June, the U.S. had announced to treat four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies.Following the move, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had criticized Washington's actions, calling them further proof of the U.S.'s political oppression of the Chinese media."We strongly urge the U.S. to discard the Cold War mentality and ideological bias, and immediately stop and correct these damaging and harmful actions," MOFA spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said."The US has gone too far," Editor-in-Chief of Global Times Hu Xijin tweeted following the announcement.

The officer went astray as he responded to a request from herders to help them search for yaks late Sunday.It started at the 38th parallel north.On June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).Within two days, the U.S. government ordered troops to invade the DPRK and sent its Seventh Fleet into China's Taiwan Straits.On July 7, the United States manipulated the United Nations (UN) Security Council to adopt a resolution on dispatching a UN force that it led to the Korean Peninsula. The United States mobilized a third of its army, half of its navy and a fifth of its air force to join the war. Its peak troop strength topped 300,000.On September 15, the U.S. forces conducted the Incheon Landing, forcing the DPRK forces to retreat. Meanwhile, U.S. military planes intruded into China's airspace, bombing airports and infrastructure along its border with the DPRK.Do not step across the 38th parallel, China repeatedly cautioned. But the United States ignored the warning. Its army poured across the line on October 7 and pressed on towards the Sino-Korean border.The next day, at a time when China's national security was threatened and upon receiving then DPRK leader Kim Il Sung's urgent request for aid, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) was formed.On October 19, the CPV crossed the Yalu River to fight together with the DPRK army.It could have been a one-sided war. In 1950, China's industrial and agricultural output was 1/12 of the U.S. total, while its steel output 1/144 of the U.S. total.During the war, the U.S. military used all the latest weapons (other than nuclear), while the CPV mainly relied on infantry and limited artillery. The two sides were heavily mismatched in weapons, equipment, logistics and food supplies. But what happened next was beyond expectation.On October 25, the CPV launched the first battle, driving back the enemy forces to the Chongchon River.On November 7, the second battle started, ending with the U.S.-led army retreating to the south of the 38th parallel.Up to June 1951, the CPV launched five major battles in seven months that inflicted heavy losses on the UN force led by the United States, and essentially fixed the front around the 38th parallel.On July 10, 1951, the first truce talks began at Kaesong, near the 38th parallel.For the next two years, the Korean War continued as a stalemate â both negotiations and combat went on.On October 14, 1952, the Battle of Triangle Hill began. It was a hill covering 3.7 square kilometers.The United States had planned to seize the area with two battalions in five days at the expense of 200 casualties â but it ultimately cost 60,000 troops, 43 days and 25,000 casualties before the battle ended.Over 11,000 CPV soldiers were wounded or killed in the battle.On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in the village of Panmunjom, ending the 33-month War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.According to China's official release, more than 1.093 million enemy combatants were killed, wounded or captured. In the United States, the Korean War has been called "the Forgotten War."To protect their motherland, a total of 2.9 million CPV soldiers entered the battlefield and 197,653 sacrificed their lives, according to the latest data. For China, history will never be forgotten, and the heroes will be remembered.Managing editor: Hu YiweiVideo editor: Yu QianhuiAnimation &amp; graphics: Xu Qianyun, Chen Yuyang, Yin YatingVoiceover: Zeng ZiyiCopy editor: John GoodrichChief editor: Wang DeweiProducer: Dang ZhengManaging director: Mei YanSeventy years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) crossed the Yalu River and fought alongside the army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) against the Republic of Korea (ROK) and U.S.-led UN forces.A total of 2.9 million CPV soldiers entered the battlefield, 197,653 of whom sacrificed their lives in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953 Korean War).As 2020 marks the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, here are five facts you may not know about the conflict:1. China, U.S. never officially declared warNeither China nor the United States officially engaged in the conflict as nation states: China sent aâvolunteerâ force and the U.S. dominated and led UN forces. On June 27, 1950, two days after the war in Korean Peninsula broke out, U.S. President Harry Truman ordered navy and air force to intervene and the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait. Three days later he approved the use of ground forces on the Korean Peninsula.The U.S. Constitution states that Congress should decide when and where the country should go to a war. However, Truman's order was made without congressional approval, and war was never officially declared.Truman later argued a United Nations resolution gave him authority, but he ordered armed forces to the peninsula before the UN acted and before an agreement with the UN was reached.China sent forces under the banner of "volunteers" following a request for help from the DPRK and to protect China's national sovereignty, security and interests.Chairman Mao Zedong on October 8, 1950 issued an order saying, "In order to assist the Korean people's war of liberation against the attacks of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, thereby safeguarding the interests of the people of Korea, China and the other countries in the East, I hereby order to change the Northeastern Border Defense Army into the CPV."On October 19, 1950, as requested by the DPRK, CPV forces crossed the Yalu River to aid the DPRK's fight.The CPV launched its first battle on October 25 against a battalion of Syngman Rhee's troops. In 1951, the CPC Central Committee decided to commemorate the war annually on that date.2. Misperception between China and the U.SThe Chinese government repeatedly cautioned that if U.S. forces crossed the 38th parallel China would not sit idle, but the U.S. disregarded the warning, seeing it as only diplomatic parlance.After the U.S.-led UN forces landed at Inchon, 160 kilometers south of the 38th parallel, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai publicly warned on September 30, 1950 that, "The Chinese people enthusiastically love peace, but in order to defend peace they never have been and never will be afraid to oppose aggressive war.""The Chinese people absolutely will not tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they supinely tolerate seeing their neighbors being savagely invaded by imperialists," he added.On October 1, 1950, DPRK leader Kim Il Sung sent a telegram to Mao reporting the grim picture on the battlefield and requesting military aid from China.Since diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. had not been established, Indian Ambassador Kavalam Madhava Panikkar acted as a communication channel between the two camps.On October 2, Zhou formally notified Panikkar that if the U.S. crossed the 38th parallel, China would act. In Washington, Secretary of State Dean Acheson dismissed the warning as the "mere vaporings of a panicky Panikkar."In a document titled "Two Strategic Intelligence Mistakes in Korea, 1950," the CIA admitted U.S. intelligence erred: it believed that China, with limited military and economic capability, would not follow through on its warnings.U.S. forces crossed the 38th Parallel on October 7, and the CPV launched its first battle on October 25.3. Soviet Union sent air supportDeclassified documents from Russia show the Soviet Union was closely involved in the Korean War.In addition to diplomatic and logistical support, the Soviet Union sent air forces to the war from early November 1950. In order to avoid the appearance of direct military clashes with the U.S., Soviet pilots wore CPV uniforms and their aircraft carried CPV or DPRK markings.Records from the Soviet 64th Fighter Aviation Corps claim that from November 1950 till July 1953, the Soviets shot down 1,309 U.S. planes.The Soviet Union provided the CPV with enormous supplies of weapons, equipment and ammunition. China's military debt to the Soviet Union reached 3 billion yuan during the war.4. Japan was a major beneficiary Japan, which didn't send troops to the battlefield, was a major economic beneficiary during the Korean War. U.S. troops were stationed in Japan, so military goods were often purchased from Japanese companies. These companies received more than $3.5 billion over the three years of the conflict. Japan's production increased by nearly 70 percent and military procurement peaked at a level equivalent to seven percent of Japan's gross national product in 1953. By the time the three-year war ended in a truce, Japan's gross domestic product had returned to pre-World War II levels.  5. A never-ending war The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, but a peace treaty is yet to be inked. So although hostilities ceased in 1953, the war has not formally ended. "We cannot commemorate the Korean War in a genuine manner yet. That is because the war has yet to come to an end," ROK President Moon Jae-in said in June when attending a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader, Kim Jong Un, paid tribute to Chinese People's Volunteers(CPV) martyrs in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the CPV army entering the DPRK during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, local media reported.The Korean Central News Agency(KCNA) reported on Thursday that Kim, together with DPRK officials, visited CPV's martyrs tower at the cemetery for martyrs of the CPV in South Pyongan Province. A flower basket was presented in Kim's name.Kim Jong Un said that although it has been 70 years since the war, the people of DPRK still remember the heroic achievements of the CPV in resisting U.S. aggression and selflessly supporting the DPRK under extremely difficult circumstances.He said that the country will never forget the CPV soldiers' noble spirit of selflessness as they risked their lives and made sacrifices to conquer invasion of the forces of imperialism.No matter how much time passes and generations change, the significance of the great victory achieved by the two countries in the war created a link between the military and the people that remains unchanged, the DPRK leader said.According to the KCNA, Kim also visited the Friendship Tower in Pyongyang on Wednesday, presenting a flower basket at the tower.The Friendship Tower was built on October 25, 1959 to commemorate the CPV sacrifice in the war.(Cover: The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Un pays tribute to martyrs of Chinese People's Volunteers(CPV) commemorating the 70th anniversary of the CPV army entering the DPRK in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. /CCTV)There are two weeks to go until election day in the United States, 30 million Americans have already voted and Donald Trump and Joe Biden have spent the past seven days on the campaign trail in the critical swing states that will decide who wins the race for the White House.Election 2020: How is a U.S. president elected?Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionHere's what you might have missed over the past week.Biden has a stable polling advantage over Trump, more than eight points nationally according to CGTN analysis and by slightly smaller margins in the battlegrounds, but while the Democrat's lead has been steady for weeks, his campaign is warning against complacency."The very searing truth is that Donald Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire," Biden's campaign manager cautioned in a memo to supporters on Saturday.Trump has intensified his schedule, addressing rallies across the country â including Nevada, which he only narrowly lost in 2016 â with mainly mask-less crowds sitting shoulder to shoulder even as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are on the rise in 48 of the 50 states and polls suggest a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the pandemic. The president encouraged "lock her up" chants towards Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer â the subject of a recent kidnapping plot â again insulted infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and engaged in Twitter spats with fellow Republicans up for reelection including Senator Ben Sasse, who in a call to his Nebraska constituents warned of a "Republican bloodbath in the Senate."There are doubts over whether rallies to existing supporters are the best use of resources for a campaign that is running far behind in fundraising: in September Biden and his affiliates raked in $383 million, a huge $135 million more than Trump's $248 million.Whereas Trump's rallies led to free media worth tens of millions of dollars in 2016, in this cycle â even though they continue to dominate local news in key areas and aid data collection â they generally only appear on national news in a negative light, reinforcing views of his handling of the pandemic or amplifying the kind of rhetoric which has turned off older voters and suburban women.Biden, whose running mate Kamala Harris was off the campaign trail for several days after a senior aide tested positive for COVID-19, also surprised many by winning the TV ratings war as the candidates took part in competing town hall events last week.But eyes now turn to the last presidential debate, with Trump already telling supporters that the moderator, NBC News' Kristen Welker, is "terrible and unfair" and the campaigns arguing over the topics due for discussion on Thursday evening.Trump is scheduled to continue his rallies through the week, while Biden is huddling down with advisers preparing for the final mass viewership event of the election â a debate where fireworks are expected, as the president tries to knock his challenger out of his comfort zone and the Democrat aims to keep things steady with the clocking ticking ever closer to November 3.Video: Wang Zengzheng and Zhou TingyuScript: John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.Editor's note: The story is part of our continuing World Factory series, which delves into the trajectory of China's economic growth amid a changing geopolitical landscape, the pandemic and a global economic recession. Here are the first, second and third stories. The trade war and the pandemic have fueled speculation about a potential wave of offshoring from China.But Trueanalog Strictly OEM, a high-end audio speaker factory based in Guangzhou, continues to operate in China. And it has no plans to leave, said Philip Richardson, the factory's American owner. The factory manufactures loudspeakers for the world's top speaker brands, e.g. Avantone, and most of its products are exported to Europe and the U.S. The facility employs around 20 workers and has found its niche, targeting the premium market segment â home stereo speakers or headphones with a price tag over $1,000. "I don't know a single American speaker factory that moved outside of China. This is where the greatest resources of parts are... right here," said Richardson. China dominates the production of raw materials required to make speakers, including magnet, copper, aluminum and low carbon steel, he added. The vertical integration of Chinese supply chains is a major reason why little production has gone offshore, according to Emily Jiang, purchasing manager of Triangle, a French high-end speaker manufacturer. Most parts are sourced from the Yangtze River Delta Region and the Pearl River Delta Region, and can be easily shipped to manufacturers. "It is so easy to procure parts that go into speakers domestically," she noted, "which is why we won't go to Southeast Asian countries where many still depend on China for the supply of parts." China has become the world's manufacturing powerhouse over the past two decades. In 2010, the value created in China by manufacturing surpassed the U.S., making it the largest manufacturer in the world, according to data from the World Bank. But China's labor-cost advantage is disappearing. Wages have gone up 15 to 20 percent per year, shrinking the total cost advantage of doing businesses in China. Amid the rising labor cost, some low-end manufacturing, like garment production, has moved to Southeast Asia. But what has made China a vital manufacturing hub is not just cheap labor, but a skilled workforce, especially in fields which involve intricate hand work. Speaker production is still a labor-intensive industry, according to Richardson. For example, a worker needs to install the wires on a loudspeaker coin, a task that is impossible for robots to handle, at least for now."It is in the DNA of Chinese workers to work hard and do a good job," said Richardson. Contrary to conventional belief that factories in China are stuffed by young laborers, many workers at Trueanalog are over the age of 30 and have been at the factory for more than five years. For Richardson, his workers are integral to the success of his businesses. At the factory, workers are allowed to take a 10-minute break every two hours, and follow a schedule of five days a week, eight hours per day. "This work schedule is rare in Chinese OEM factories," said a female worker on the production line, who is from landlocked Sichuan Province.The pandemic dealt a heavy blow to the global supply chain. Global manufacturing output declined in the second quarter by 11.2 percent in a year-over-year comparison, following a drop by six percent in the previous quarter, according to data from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. But China's manufacturing PMI has remained in expansion territory since February this year, and its exports have surged since June. Richardson's factory has been working around the clock to meet that surging demand. The pandemic has given him a boost since April, he said. Because consumers are spending more time at home, sales have gone up 30 percent for Trueanalog. China's total export of speakers also jumped in recent months, with the figures for July and August higher than in the same months last year, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. The pandemic, in a way, has highlighted countries' reliance on China for the supply chain. Some countries have tried to lure businesses back to their home countries in the post-pandemic world. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, has called for American companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but that does not seem to be happening "en masse." According to a survey done by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which included responses from 340 companies, 92 percent of them said they had no plans to move out of China, and only 5.1 percent of companies with global revenues over 500 million U.S. dollars planned to leave. "It is simply too expensive to manufacture in the U.S.," said Richardson. While it costs companies around $75 per hour to employ an American worker, it takes only $30 per day ($3.75 per hour) to hire a skilled Chinese worker in the speaker production industry. Even if companies ship the semi-products from China and assemble them in the U.S., it would still be too costly, he added. He was once approached by an American customer to make three-inch drivers in the U.S. But after doing a cost analysis, he realized that it would cost American manufacturers an additional $20 per speaker to assemble them in the U.S. "For people saying China is taking away jobs, noâ¦.It is simply a matter of economics," he noted. Writer: Yu Jing Videographer: Shen LanglangVideo editors: Amy Chen, Yu Jing Data editor: Hu YiweiCover image: Pan YufeiOn Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump nominated conservative federal appellate Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died from complications of pancreatic cancer earlier this month."She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution," Trump said of Barrett from the White House Rose Garden."This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation."The announcement came at a time when nearly six in 10 Americans say the president elected in November should be the one to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Meanwhile, 44 percent of respondents think the current court is "about right" in terms of ideological leanings, while 34 percent think it is too conservative and 22% too liberal, according to the same poll.If confirmed after Senate hearings in mid-October, Barrett would bring the number of conservative justices to six on the nine-member court â a dramatic turn to the right that could have far-reaching impact on the country's judicial and political development long after President Trump exits the White House.With the Republicans holding a 53-47 advantage in the Senate, Trump appears to have a clear path to having his third Supreme Court pick confirmed, after Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.What does a 6-3 court means?Trump's timely nomination has set off media speculation about unwinding decades of liberal progress on a wide range of issues from voting to abortion, and bringing American jurisprudence back decades.If Barrett joins, she would be the sixth Catholic on the bench and the fifth woman to do so in the court's 231-year history.Since the end of World War II, the U.S. Supreme Court has kept a balance of 5-4, with the majority being liberal or conservative. The intricate balance has kept the court from being one-sided, since one vote from the other camp could help tip the court's decision to its favor. However, a 6-3 bench could mean the conservatives can afford to lose one vote and still prevail.With a dominant majority and hence a more predictable outcome, the conservative camp â Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh with the addition of Amy Coney Barrett â will also be more emboldened to direct America's highest court to take on controversial cases which have been sidestepped in the past when the outcome was less clear with a 5-4 bench.Appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005, the generally conservative Chief Justice John G. Roberts has functioned as a swing vote on some key occasions, including siding with his liberal colleagues to uphold the Affordable Care Act in 2012. Now, the only three liberal justices would have to pursue Roberts plus another conservative Justice in order to come up on top in any decision. A 6-3 conservative bench would likely loosen restrictions on fire arms which many Republicans see as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Besides, the advancement of LGBT rights in recent decades would also likely experience significant challenges as religious rights expands. However, no issue is as divisive as abortion.As a candidate, Trump has promised to overturn Roe v. Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision which legalized abortion in the U.S. With a third Trump justice, it is likely that this campaign promise could materialize.Who is Barrett?During her nomination speech, Barrett praised the legacy left behind by Justice Ginsburg for having "smashed" the glass ceiling for women in the legal profession. However, carrying a proven conservative record voting record on a range of issues including gun rights and abortion, she will likely take the opposite end of the ideological spectrum as the woman she's set to replace."A judge must apply the law as written," she said. "Judges are not policy makers."The statement is an homage to the legal principle known as originalism which argues the constitution should be interpreted based on the original intent of the authors at the time it was ratified. This concept was evangelized by the giant of conservative jurisprudence, Justice Antonin Scalia whom Barrett clerked for from 1998 to 1999.While Scalia's approach to the constitution has sometimes led him to liberal conclusions, Barrett's legal opinions have been more influenced by her lifelong devotion to Catholicism.During her teaching career at Notre Dame, she often invoked God in articles and speeches, according to the Associated Press. In a 2006 address, she encouraged graduating law students to see their careers as a means to "building the kingdom of God."Barrett was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1972. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company and her mother a high school French teacher. She attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship and graduated with honors. She is also mom to seven children. Editor's note: THIS IS CHINA is an original animated series CGTN Digital presents for the Two Sessions. Each episode focuses on the most popular topics and trends in China, recounting how China's economy and society, guided by government policies, have evolved in the new era.  The key term in this episode: The Cashless Era.Spending a day without cash or bank cards is perfectly unremarkable in China.More than three-quarters of Chinese people were using digital payment in preference to cash by 2017 and the number has continued to rise. Eighty-six percent now use mobile payment, whether to pay utility bills, travel short or long distances, make appointments at hospital or go grocery shopping. The growth in use of digital payment has been supported by the development of advanced technologies. According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the number of 4G base stations in China totaled 5.44 million in 2019 â more than half of the world's total. With the innovation of the QR code, online and offline payments have been further combined.Read more:China's QR code industry to be worth multi-trillions of yuan by 2025Common Destiny: 'QR code planters' bring cashless payment to the worldMobile payment platforms WeChat Pay and Alipay have also contributed to the development of the cashless society in China.In recent years, Bluetooth payment, biometric payment, sonic payment, AR/VR payment and other emerging payment methods have been launched.Meanwhile, the number of 5G base stations in use nationwide has exceeded 200,000 according to the latest data from the MIIT, which means that China has hit the "fast-forward" button on the construction of Internet infrastructure.The proportion of 5G users in China is expected to increase to nearly 50 percent by 2025, and 5G commercialization will create more possibilities for the growth of the cashless era.Read more:5G Phones will outsell 4G by 2023China leads global race in key 5G patents: reportThe country's internet availability rate has increased by 3.8 percentage points year on year to 59.6 percent, according to the 43rd statistical report from the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), further laying the foundation for a high rate of online payment users.The central bank and other financial authorities have announced they want to spread the benefits of going cashless to the four out of 10 people in China who still live in rural areas. According to the central bank, 66.5 percent of people in rural areas were already using digital payments by 2017.Read more:China's mobile payment enters overseas marketsAlipay's worldwide users exceed 1 billionIn fact, mobile payment also helps the sharing economy, e-retailing, digital governance, education and healthcare as well as other emerging technologies, business fields and models, such as smart governance, smart hospitals, automated payment and other industrial applications.The merits and convenience of a cashless society are significant, but concerns over safety and privacy also need to be addressed. And the risk that a cashless society could marginalize older and less tech-savvy spenders and the less well-off also need to be considered.Read more:China's central bank regulates forced cashless payment Editor: Duan FengyuanCopy Editor: John GoodrichChief Editor: Chen RanSenior Consultant: Dr. Xia JixuanProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiAn Israeli delegation made a visit to Sudan on Wednesday to discuss normalizing ties, Israeli public broadcaster Kan radio said, as a minister predicted a possible diplomatic breakthrough between the two countries.Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Israel's media that he believed Israel was "very close to normalizing ties with Sudan."Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and the Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment when asked about prospects for a breakthrough with Sudan. In a foreign-policy flourish ahead of his re-election bid, top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump this week escorted Israeli delegates to Bahrain and UAE delegates to Israel, cementing Israel's new, U.S.-brokered relations with the Gulf states.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the United States had begun the process of removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and was also working "diligently" to get Khartoum to recognize Israel.Pompeo stopped short of saying Sudan's removal would be linked to whether it would agree to normalize relations with Israel.

"With no single piece of evidence, they (Sweden) are just suppressing Chinese telecom companies under the excuse of [threatening] national security."They are politicizing normal economic activities, Zhao said.Stockholm announced the decision ahead of the spectrum auction scheduled for next month. According to the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS), the setting of the licence conditions followed assessments by the Swedish Armed Forces and security service, which has called China "one of the biggest threats against Sweden."The Swedish authorities gave companies in the auction a deadline of January 1, 2025 to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment from their existing infrastructure."The ban leaves network operators with less options and risks slowing the roll out of 5G in markets where competition is reduced," said Ben Wood, chief of research at leading research mobile communication company CCS Insight, as quoted by Reuters. Sweden-based telecommunications giant Ericsson, Huawei's biggest rival in 5G technology, may likely be one of the beneficiaries.British political and international relations analyst Tom Fowdy questioned the legitimacy of the move. Specifically, he pointed out that Swedish products have been widely valued and put in use in China, "one must question whether it is fair that Sweden is banning Huawei and ZTE. Is this the reciprocity on market access that Europe keeps asking for?""China is opening its markets, but as seen by the new entity list and export control laws, it is also equipping itself with tools to deal with countries that are not playing fairly," Fowdy wrote in a CGTN opinion piece.On Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm also rejected accusations that Huawei and ZTE posed threats to Sweden's national security."We urge the Swedish government to abide by the market principles of open development and fair competition, and reconsider the relevant decision," the embassy wrote on its website."We are resolutely opposed to abusing the concept of 'national security' and â¦ rejecting specific enterprises from specific countries," it added.Sweden's ban on two Chinese telecommunication companies, Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp., from its 5G networks on Tuesday has drawn strong opposition from Beijing."Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp. have been strictly abiding by local laws," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Wednesday.

Based off state data, with almost 1.7 million people voting, turnout jumped 142% in the first eight days compared to the same time four years ago.As millions of votes come in across the U.S., it's unclear how long it will take to count them all, which means a clear winner might not be decided by the end of the night on November 3rd.The process for receiving and counting votes also differs by state.

As of Tuesday, more than 4.6 million Texans have voted, according to the U.S. Elections Project.That's more than half of the ballots counted for the 2016 presidential election, Fox News reports.The state also saw a jump in voter registration this year.

The coronavirus pandemic and severe flooding have added to its woes.Removal from the terrorism list â once Khartoum sets aside $335 million it agreed to pay to U.S. victims of militant attacks and their families â could help ease economic pain, partly by unlocking international financing and debt relief.Washington has offered Sudan development and humanitarian help, U.S. and Gulf-based sources said in September, after U.S. officials and military head General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan discussed the issue of Israel in September.But while the United States has been lobbying hard for Sudan to normalize ties with Israel just as it finalizes Khartoum's removal from the list, Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has argued the two issues should not be linked."It is not possible for an entire people to be forced to normalize in a week or two," acting Finance Minister Hiba Mohamed Ali told Sudanese TV on Monday."If it is our wish to normalize relations with Israel, we must give a suitable chance for the issue to be studied in detail."Despite apparent support from Burhan, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda in February, and his military deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who recently praised Israel's economic development, a rapid move to normalize ties could fracture the civilian coalition they share power with."Our view of the Zionist entity remained fixed â that it is a racist entity hostile to all national liberation movements," said Sadiq Farouk, a Communist Party leader from the coalition that backs the government.Hamdok has said he is not authorized to decide on ties with Israel. "With this position, Hamdok wants to avoid any decision that might lead to a split in the ruling coalition that supports the government," said Fath Alrahman Ahmed of Khartoum's Al-Neelain University.Recognizing Israel could also trigger a backlash from Islamist factions loyal to Bashir that have sought to discredit the transition.Still, people have been able to signal support for establishing ties publicly for the first time.A former member of parliament, Abulgasem Bartum, says he is planning a private trip with 40 Sudanese businesspersons, sportspeople and cultural figures to Israel as a confidence building measure next month.In Jerusalem, Zvi Hauser, chairman of the Israeli parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, told public broadcaster Kan Israel could help the region with science and technology and he hoped Sudan joined the "wave" of recognition.Some younger Sudanese, less wedded to the Palestinian cause than their parents or grandparents, say they could also back the move."I have no objection to Sudan having normal relations with Israel if this is in the interest of the country," said Ahmed Ibrahim, a 30-year-old telecommunications company employee."We want jobs, health, education and a better life ... Sudan should take care of itself."U.S. pressure on Sudan to normalize ties with former adversary Israel has stirred public debate on a topic that was long a taboo, exposing splits that could complicate any swift settlement of a deal.An agreement between Sudan and Israel may have edged closer on Monday when U.S. President Donald Trump signaled that Washington would remove Khartoum from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.Military figures leading Sudan's political transition have appeared open to normalizing ties, but civilian groups including left-wing and Islamist politicians are more reluctant.A technocratic government has so far rebuffed U.S. advances aimed at pushing Sudan to follow the lead of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, both of which signed agreements to establish formal ties with Israel at the White House last month.Khartoum's caution reflects concerns that such a major foreign policy move at a time of deep economic crisis could upset the delicate balance between military and civilian factions, and even put the government at risk, two senior Sudanese government sources said."Taking a historic decision over relations with Israel requires a situation of economic and political stability in the country," said one of the sources."After the lifting of U.S. sanctions, Sudan could discuss dialogue about normalization with Israel and its benefits to Sudan, according to Sudan's interests."Sudan, which historically has been staunchly opposed to Israel, is 18 months into a political transition after autocrat Omar al-Bashir was forced from power following popular protests.The government faces spiraling inflation of more than 200 percent and has struggled to provide basic commodities and services.

He described the visit as "a glorious day for peace."  "Today, we are making history in a way that will stand for generations," the right-wing premier said of the Israeli-UAE accord, which has been angrily denounced by the Palestinians.   The two states signed four agreements on Monday, including one "exempting our nationals from visas," Netanyahu announced, arguing that free movement of people would offer benefits to the Israeli and Emirati economies. Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, described Tuesday's UAE visit as "shameful." Speaking in Ramallah, in the Israel-occupied West Bank, he said it came amid Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank. "The bilateral agreements that were announced today and the delegations that come and go, all of that offers the occupation a strength to escalate its aggression and its crimes against the Palestinian people and increases its intransigence and arrogance," he said. In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, a spokesman for the Islamist group Hamas, said, "Such a visit will only encourage the occupation to pursue the gradual annexation of West Bank lands."The five-hour visit would be restricted to the airport near Tel Aviv due to coronavirus concerns, Israeli organizers said. (With input from agencies; Cover: CFP)Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed Monday to reciprocal visa-free travel, making Emirati citizens the first in the Arab world to be exempted from Israeli entry permits.   The deal was signed after the first-ever official delegation from the UAE landed in Israel for a day of talks following an agreement to normalize ties signed at the White House last month.   Wearing a mask, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greeted the UAE delegation at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.

But besides free publicity, some of these companies are also profiting from the race. Unlike Twitter, which banned political ads, Facebook is still running them, and Trump's and Biden's expenditures on this platform have hit $165 million since the beginning of the year.According to information available at the Facebook Ad Library, and analysed by CGTN Digital, between January 1 and October 17, Democratic candidate Joe Biden poured in $82.71 million and President Donald Trump $82.38 million into the platform.Since January this year, the Republican candidate has been spending on Facebook ads, but has now been surpassed by Biden. The Democrat started investing more heavily at the beginning of August, before being formally nominated by the party, and then intensified spending after the nomination. In the week between October 11 to 17 and the last 30 days (September 18 â October 17), Biden outran Trump in terms of expenditures on Facebook. In that week alone, the Democrat side spent $7.14 million and the Republicans another $4.51 million. Biden is certainly using part of the $383 million raised in September, a significant $135 million more than Trump's $248 million.Starting this month, the president has been spending less and less, which might be considered a strange move, as polls show voters are giving the lead to the Democrats, and increasing social media campaign could help bridge the gap with its specific targeting.Besides, his presidential campaign gained a reputation for running the strongest digital ad promotion in 2016, which might mean a new push before the seven-day ad ban on Facebook is implemented. The company decided in September to restrict new political ads in the week before the election and remove posts that convey misinformation about COVID-19 and voting as to avoid being used to sow chaos and spread misinformation before, during, and after the U.S. presidential election.

Biden spent more than Trump on those states: $1.53 million and almost $1 million, respectively.Other focus states are Texas and California. The president has used $6.49 million in ads in the Lone Star State, double the amount of Biden, who doesn't seem to be focusing there.

But besides free publicity, some of these companies are also profiting from the race. Unlike Twitter, which banned political ads, Facebook is still running them, and Trump's and Biden's expenditures on this platform have hit $165 million since the beginning of the year.According to information available at the Facebook Ad Library, and analysed by CGTN Digital, between January 1 and October 17, Democratic candidate Joe Biden poured in $82.71 million and President Donald Trump $82.38 million into the platform.Since January this year, the Republican candidate has been spending on Facebook ads, but has now been surpassed by Biden.

Armenia denied firing it.The ceasefire was agreed on Saturday after an earlier deal brokered by Russia failed to halt the deadliest clashes in the South Caucasus since the 1990s.So far, the main driver of diplomacy between the ex-Soviet enemies has been Russia. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev both told Russia's TASS news agency in separate interviews on Monday that they were ready to come to Moscow for talks.The failure to stop the fighting has raised fears of a humanitarian crisis, and put new strains on ties between Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan, and its NATO allies which want the conflict to end.Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway enclave of Azerbaijan that is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, said 729 of its military personnel and 36 civilians had been killed in fighting that began on September 27. Azerbaijan said 61 Azeri civilians had been killed and 282 wounded. It has not disclosed its military casualties.Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri forces were shelling their positions in northern and southern areas of the line of contact that divides them.They said Azeri forces had shelled civilian settlements including the town of Martuni and four villages - charges that were denied by Azerbaijan. They reported one civilian killed and one wounded in Martuni.The Azeri defense ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Agjebedin, Tovuz and Dashkesan regions far from the conflict zone â accusations denied by Armenia.The ministry also said Terter and Aghdam regions were under shelling. AzTV state television said one of its journalists was wounded in Terter.The Azeri prosecutor general's office said Armenia had targeted a pipeline in the Khizi district of Azerbaijan, more than 300 km (186 miles) from the conflict zone, on Sunday afternoon. The pipeline, which carries oil to Novorossiisk in Russia, was not damaged but some missile fragments fell about 250 meters (820 feet) away, it said.Dismissing the report, Armenian defense ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said: "It's a total lie.âA ceasefire brokered in Moscow earlier this month was aimed at letting the sides swap detainees and bodies of those killed, but it had little impact on the fighting.The new ceasefire was announced on Saturday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov talked to the Armenian and Azeri foreign ministers by telephone.A new ceasefire in the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh was in jeopardy on Monday with Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces reporting shelling and heavy fighting.Among accusations on both sides, Azerbaijan said it had "neutralized" a missile fired by Armenian forces at an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan on Sunday, several hours after the ceasefire went into force.

Protestors were using Twitter and the #EndSars hashtag to spread photos and videos showing alleged police brutality.Most demonstrations are now peaceful, after the Nigerian authorities barred the police from using force against the protesters, but the reported violence is on the rise.At least two were killed around demonstrations on Saturday in Osogbo in southwestern Osun state, a spokesman for Governor Gboyega Oyetola told Reuters.

Many showed up wearing masks to protect against the coronavirus pandemic, held up banners, sang and danced. Police even gradually pulled back from the Plaza Italia."It's great, very good and positive. They're pure good things for Chile in everything from here," demonstrator Viviana Donoso, 43, told AFP as she and a group of people danced to drums."The people of Chile need to unite, and we have to believe that we can do things."Some even turned up to the demonstration in fancy dress. Demonstrators also called for their countrymen to vote to "approve" the proposed constitutional change, a key demand of the 2019 protests."This is the opportunity to say enough! We're here and we're going to vote for 'Approve,'" Paulina Villarroel, a 29-year-old psychologist, told AFP.Police estimated that Sunday's rally in Santiago attracted around 25,000 people by 6 p.m., far smaller than the largest protests of 2019.The demonstrations, while largely peaceful early on, were marred by increasing incidents of violence, looting of supermarkets and clashes with police across the capital later in the day. Fire truck sirens, burning barricades on roadways and fireworks on downtown streets added to a sense of chaos in some neighborhoods.Interior Minister Victor Perez spoke late in the evening, praising the early, peaceful rallies while blasting the late-night mayhem. He called on Chileans to settle their differences by voting in the upcoming constitutional referendum."Those who carry out these acts of violence do not want Chileans to solve our problems through democratic means," Perez told reporters, vowing to punish those who crossed the line Sunday.Early in the day, an angry mob jeered and threatened a Communist Party mayor. Later, masked individuals firebombed a police headquarters and church. Vandals attacked another Santiago church in the early evening, setting its spire aflame and choking side streets with smoke.More than 15 metro stations were temporarily closed amid the unrest. Police fired tear gas and water cannons in skirmishes with sometimes violent, hooded and masked people.Last year's protests, which began October 18, raged until mid-December as Chileans gathered nationwide to call for reforms to the pension, healthcare and education systems. Rioting and looting resulted in billions of dollars in damage and losses to the country's businesses and infrastructure. The unrest saw the military take to the streets for the first time since the rule of Augusto Pinochet.In the past few days, small-scale demonstrations and isolated incidents of violence have nonetheless resurfaced in Chile, as the capital's six million citizens emerge from months of confinement following the COVID-19 pandemic.Most demonstrators on Sunday wore masks, but many could be seen in tight groups, raising concerns about a potential health risk.(With input from agencies)Tens of thousands of Chileans gathered in the central square of Santiago to mark the one-year anniversary of mass protests that left over 30 dead and thousands injured, with peaceful rallies on Sunday devolving by nightfall into riots and looting.People gathered early in the day in demonstrations downtown and in cities throughout Chile that gained size and fervor through the evening.

It also shows the Chinese people's unity and love for their country and the Chinese nation's determination to safeguard peace. Wang called for carrying forward the spirit of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to strive for a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and to achieve the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.Covering some 3,300 square meters, the exhibition features 540 photos, 15 artworks and a total of 1,900 items, including maps, documents, flags, badges, and weapons, which were used or captured during the war.Among them are 824 pieces of precious cultural relics unveiled to the public for the first time, according to the organizers.Through a large number of precious exhibits, the event reflects the nature of justice and great victory of the war, and recounts CPV soldiers' heroic deeds and revolutionary spirit during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953).On October 19, 1950, as requested by the DPRK, CPV forces crossed the Yalu River to aid the DPRK's fight there until a truce was signed in 1953.

Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory," the embassy said.China and the Pacific island country established diplomatic relations in 1975.According to official Chinese data, the bilateral trade reached over $482 million in 2018, representing a 26-percent increase from the year before.China highly appreciates the Fijian government for upholding the one-China principle and expects that the Fijian side will tackle this issue properly, the embassy said.Foreign Ministry: Taiwan is playing the trick of a thief crying 'stop thief'The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday said Taiwan is playing the trick of a thief crying "stop thief," and stressed that any attempt to use the Taiwan issue to provoke ties between China and Pacific island countries will not succeed.There is no "diplomatic relationship" between Taiwan and Fiji, said spokesperson Zhao Lijian.

The record-shattering figure is being driven in part by concerns about crowds at polling sites on Election Day amid the coronavirus pandemic.In North Carolina, a battleground where 1.4 million, or 20 percent, of the state's registered voters, had already voted as of Sunday morning, Biden urged residents to cast ballots as soon as possible. "We gotta keep the incredible momentum going; we can't let up," he said at a "drive-in rally" in Durham, as attendees sitting in their cars honked in approval. "Don't wait - go vote today."Biden also criticized Trump for saying over the weekend that the U.S. had "turned the corner" in the coronavirus pandemic, noting that the rate of new cases across the country has risen to the highest level in months."As my grandfather would say, 'This guy's gone around the bend if he thinks we've turned the corner,'" Biden said.

Trump put a handful of 20 dollars bills into an offering bucket and bowed his head during a prayer.Trump will campaign every day leading up to Thursday's debate in Florida, including stops in Arizona and North Carolina, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.While Trump lags in opinion polls at a national level and in many battleground states, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said over the weekend that the national figures are misleading because must-win states are close."We cannot become complacent because the very searing truth is that Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire," she wrote in a memo to donors.U.S. presidential elections are determined by electoral votes, allotted to U.S. states and territories based largely on their populations, rather than by a tally of the popular vote nationwide.Trump campaigned on Saturday in Michigan and Wisconsin, two battleground states he narrowly won in the 2016 election.In Muskegeon, Mich., he attacked Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, for imposing restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus and made light of a right-wing plot uncovered by the FBI to kidnap her."Hopefully you'll be sending her packing pretty soon," Trump said, prompting the crowd to yell back "Lock her up!" several times.Whitmer said on Sunday's "Meet the Press" on NBC that the president's rhetoric was "incredibly disturbing" and "dangerous" for her and her family as well as other politicians whom he targets.(With input from Reuters and AFP)President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden were courting early voters on Sunday in the competitive states of Nevada and North Carolina, as the final presidential debate looms later this week.Both men are working to rouse their political bases and appeal to the seemingly small number of undecided voters in an election that could revolve around voter turnout.One key opportunity comes this week with the candidates' final nationally televised debate, on Thursday evening in Nashville, Tennessee.Some 27.7 million Americans have already cast ballots either by mail or in-person ahead of the November 3 election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.

The government of Bahrain, where a Sunni Muslim minority rules a Shi'ite majority population, has said the deal protects its interests from Iran.Mnuchin described the accord as an important step in regional stability and "just the beginning of the work that is going forward.""I think the opportunity is way beyond just investments," Mnuchin earlier told reporters on the El Al flight. "It's in technology, building various different businesses - and in the case of Bahrain as well, really expanding the opportunities for them quite, quite, quite dramatically."The ceremony also saw the signing of several memoranda of understanding. They cover trade, air services, telecommunications, finance, banking and agriculture.Mnuchin and the other U.S. officials will travel on Monday to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where the accord with Israel has uncorked bilateral commerce.

They cover trade, air services, telecommunications, finance, banking and agriculture.Mnuchin and the other U.S. officials will travel on Monday to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where the accord with Israel has uncorked bilateral commerce. On Tuesday, the U.S. officials will join the UAE's first delegation to Israel.Israel and the UAE will sign a deal on Tuesday to allow 28 weekly commercial flights between Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Israel's Transportation Ministry said on Sunday.(With input from Reuters, AFP) The UK government has become embroiled in a stand-off with the northern metropolitan area of Greater Manchester after the region's mayor refused to move the area into England's strictest tier three alert level without improved financial support.The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has demanded an improved financial package for employees of businesses who will be forced to close their doors as a result of the new measures.Burnham also believes self-employed and low-paid workers haven't been given enough help to survive the coming months and wants the government to pay them more money if they're unable to work.  On the streets, Burnham has the support of local people.Alex, an insurance worker, tells CGTN Europe he is very concerned.

Similarly, Republican George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000, but the Democrat still lost the election. And Trump could earn a second term as president even if Biden wins the most votes across the country.In a certain sense, the national vote is irrelevant in U.S. presidential elections â all that matters is the Electoral College.How does the Electoral College work?The Electoral College essentially creates 51 mini-elections, with individual contests in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). A total of 538 Electoral College votes (EVs) are split between the states and DC. The EVs are weighted by population and mirror the spread of seats in Congress: 435 representatives, 100 senators plus an additional three votes for DC equals 538.For example, California, the most populous U.S. state, has 53 representatives and two senators â equaling 55 electoral votes. Wyoming, the least populous state, has just one representative and two senators â and so three electoral votes.In all states bar Maine and Nebraska â which award two EVs to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district â the statewide winner takes all the votes.To win the presidency, a candidate must win enough states to pass the magic number of 270 â a majority of EVs.Why are the swing states critical?Strategizing where to campaign â and spend money on advertising and organizing â is vital to reaching 270. Recent history suggests around 37 states plus DC are firmly committed or lean heavily to one party or the other.It's safe to assume, for example, that California's 55 votes will go to Biden, and Wyoming's three will stick with Trump. Overall, there are around 17 states plus DC reliably in the Democratic column and 20 in the Republican column.By this measure, Biden effectively starts the election on 212 votes and Trump on 115. So where can the Democrat win the 58 votes he needs, and where can the Republican find 155?The key to every U.S. presidential election lies in the swing states, the battlegrounds which either party has a chance of winning. These are the states where the candidates will spend heavily on advertising and â pandemic allowing â make numerous campaign visits. In 2020, the key states to watch are Florida (29 EVs), Pennsylvania (20 EVs), North Carolina (15 EVs), Michigan (16 EVs), Wisconsin (10 EVs), and Arizona (11 EVs) though in such an unpredictable year others, such as Minnesota (10 EVs), Georgia (16 EVs) and Texas (38 EVs), could also come into play.How are Biden and Trump aiming to win?A starting point for determining the battlegrounds is to assess the margins of victory in 2016: Trump triumphed over Clinton with victories of less than one percentage point in the Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Those 46 Electoral College votes, won by the narrowest of margins in Midwestern states which hadn't voted Republican in decades, put the Republican in the White House.The president can afford to lose two of the Blue Wall states in 2020 and still narrowly win the Electoral College â so long as he holds on to all the others, he took in 2016 when he won states reflecting 306 Electoral College votes in total.The first and most obvious route to President Biden is for him to hold the states Clinton took in the last election and flip back Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin â that would give him 278, putting him in the White House even if he loses vote-heavy states like Florida.The Trump campaign initially looked to expand its target states to those won narrowly by Clinton in 2016, such as New Hampshire (4 EVs), Minnesota and Nevada (6 EVs) but has since changed strategy to focus on holding Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina.Biden, with a big cash advantage over Trump, could have a unique opportunity in 2020 to make inroads into traditional Republican bastions like Georgia and Texas.How is the winner decided?The winner of the presidency is the candidate with at least 270 EVs, but the process by which the state results are decided could be particularly contentious in 2020, with both parties fielding armies of lawyers in the swing states and rows over ballots likely.The EVs are really votes for individual electors, people chosen by the parties in each state to vote for either Trump or Biden on its behalf. This can create confusion, as constitutionally electors don't have to follow the states' popular votes â as several didn't in 2016 â though most are now compelled to do so by state law..While the winner of the election is traditionally projected on election night, the situation in 2020 is unique â at least half of the votes may be cast by mail or early, a huge increase on past elections â and so unless there is a decisive winner, the final result may not be known for days or weeks after November 3.The official timeline is an afterthought in most years but could be important in this cycle.The 538 electors must cast their votes by December 14, and the electoral votes must be passed to the president of the Senate by December 23. The votes are then passed to the new Congress, which meets in a joint session to count the votes on January 6 before inauguration day on January 20.What happens if there's a tie?The Electoral College system does leave open the potential for a 269-269 tie â in that scenario, the president would be decided by the state delegations in the House of Representatives.Each state would have one vote, irrelevant of their size or number of representatives, so 26 would be the number to hit.Ahead of the 2020 elections, the Republicans marginally control the most state delegations despite the Democrats holding a majority of representatives because smaller states like Wyoming, Alaska, and Montana that have just one representative are in the Republican's hands.In the event of a tie, the vice president would be elected by the Senate via majority vote.Video by Xu Qianyun, Ma Zhiyuan, Zhou Jinxi and Chen HaominScript by John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.The clock is ticking towards election day in the United States, with the eyes of the world on the battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden for the keys to the White House.The winner of the November 3 contest is decided via a system designed to give all 50 states a say, but it can have a curious outcome: the candidate with the most votes doesn't necessarily become president.Democrat Hillary Clinton won three million more votes than Trump in 2016, for example, but she's not in the White House.

He has controversially received the open backing of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Akinci's relationship with Ankara, on the other hand, has come under strain, especially after he described the prospect of the north's annexation by Turkey as "horrible" in February.Turkey has now engaged in a bitter dispute over oil and gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, partly because its claim over the marine resource around TRNC's territory isn't recognized by Greece and Cyprus. Sunday's second-round ballot was triggered after Tatar won 32 percent of the vote on October 11 ahead of Akinci, who garnered almost 30 percent in a field of 11 candidates.But Akinci is in a stronger position in the second round, having won the backing of Tufan Erhurman, a fellow Social Democrat, who came third last time around."The results of the first round tell us this: half of the Turkish Cypriot community defend a federation despite all kinds of pressure," Umut Bozkurt, vice dean and assistant professor at Eastern Mediterranean University, told AFP."This election was dominated more by Turkey-northern Cyprus relations than the Cyprus issue."The first round's results also show that a significant part of the electorate seek to be free of "pressure" from Ankara and to live in a united Cyprus, she added.Don't want to be puppetsIn the days leading up to the vote, Turkish Cypriot Twitter users used the hashtag #BarisCunku, meaning "Peace because" in Turkish.One user calling himself Ahmet Karaca wrote on Thursday, "#PeaceBecause, we don't want to be puppets in our own country, we want to be the actor, the director."When Akinci took office in 2015, he was hailed as the leader best placed to revive peace talks with the Republic of Cyprus.But hopes were dashed in July 2017 after UN-mediated negotiations collapsed in Switzerland, notably over the question of the withdrawal of tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers stationed in the TRNC.The polls come amid an economic crisis, deepened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has largely shuttered the tourism sector and led to the closure of Ercan airport in the north and crossing points to the south.The vote also comes after Turkey on Monday resumed gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, stoking tensions with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus in the south.The European Union has deplored Turkey's deployment of exploration vessels and warned Ankara against further "provocations" while multiple countries have staged military drills in the region in recent months.Earlier in October, Turkish troops angered the Republic of Cyrus and many Turkish Cypriots by reopening public access to the fenced-off disputed seaside town of Varosha for the first time since Turkish forces invaded the north.That move drew EU and UN criticism and sparked demonstrations in the Republic of Cyprus, which exercises its authority over the island's southern two-thirds, separated from the north by a UN-patrolled buffer zone.Turkey has repeatedly said it seeks to defend Turkish and Turkish Cypriots' rights in the eastern Mediterranean against a cabal of nations including Greece and Cyprus.(With input from AFP)Turkish-held northern Cyprus, a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara, votes Sunday for a new leader in a run-off election held amid heightened tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.The presidential vote pits the incumbent and favorite, Mustafa Akinci, 72 â who supports reunification with the majority Greek-speaking EU member the Republic of Cyprus in the south â against the right-wing Turkish nationalist Ersin Tatar.Tatar, 60, who advocates a two-state solution, now holds the title of "prime minister" in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).

There are over 7.3 million Bolivians eligible to vote on Sunday to pick up for new president, vice president, senators, deputies, and others for the period of 2020-2025."They are been expected in the election points where they will be safe. These (election) packages are going to be received in those points, logged and guarded," said Luis Vilca, an official for the Bolivian Electoral Tribunal. The leading contenders for the presidency are former Economy Minister Luis Arce and former President Carlos Mesa, a centrist historian and journalist. To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40 percent of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.The electoral tribunal announced on Saturday that the upcoming elections will be monitored by 213,600 citizen observers. Special election observation missions are also expected from a dozen international organizations, such as the EU, the Organization of American States and the UN, as well as several Bolivian civic organizations. In the days leading up to the vote several international observers had arrived in the Bolivian capital to ensure the execution of fair elections.The vote will be key to the direction of the landlocked country after a ballot last year prompted ousted President Evo Morales' resignation and plunged the Andean country into turmoil. However, it is reported that Bolivians in wealthier areas of the capital city of La Paz have begun stocking up on essential supplies and queuing up to buy gas ahead of the election, fearing a return of deadly clashes.The incumbent president Anez took office in November 2019 after the long-term leftist leader Evo Morales resigned the presidency and went into exile when police and army withdrew their support of him. Anez then announced her job as interim president would be to convoke elections to replace Morales. On that November, Bolivia had seen weeks of protests and turmoil where people claimed fraud over the reelection of Morales, who governed for nearly 14 years.While Morales was barred to participate into the elections for the presidency or the senate followed his ouster, he chose Arce as his stand-in for the Movement To Socialism party.

Period," she said."Vote for your daughter's future," read one message in the sea of signs carried by demonstrators. "Fight like a girl," said another.In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demonstrations were considerably smaller, though protesters still turned out in cities across the country, according to organizers.More than 100,000 people took part in some 430 marches in locations from New York to Los Angeles and Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, organizers said.They urged people worried about in-person participation to join in a "socially distant text-banking telethon" aimed at sending five million messages encouraging people to vote.Marchers also paid tribute to late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg â an icon for women and progressives â while protesting Trump's choice of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace her.Barrett has made no secret of her strong Catholic beliefs, raising concerns that a Supreme Court dominated by conservatives could overturn abortion rights if she is confirmed by the Senate.Trump and his fellow Republicans are seeking to fast-track her nomination before the election, a process that began this week and which has drawn sharp controversy.The protest route in Washington started near the White House before heading to the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court building, where a smaller "I'm With Her" counterprotest â in Barrett's favor â was held.Most marchers in Washington wore face masks to stem the spread of COVID-19, with some dressed as Ginsburg in black robes with white lace collars, and many wore the knitted pink hats made famous by the original march.A number of protesters dressed in red robes and white bonnets, portraying characters forced to bear children in the dystopian novel and television series "The Handmaid's Tale."Signs and banners underscored the broader anti-Trump message: "Trump/Pence: Out Now," read one, while others simply said, "Dump Trump."In New York, around 300 people gathered at Manhattan's Washington Square, many with pink hats and signs supporting Trump's Democratic opponent Joe Biden or honoring Ginsburg. It was one of five separate marches in the city."It's really important to be here and try to encourage people to vote out Trump and his misogynistic policies, especially now, with COVID, when a lot of people are isolated," said Yvonne Shackleton, a 47-year-old working mother from near Albany, about a three-hour drive from New York City.A similar number of people gathered in Brooklyn, Ginsburg's hometown, with one protester's sign reading: "Ruth Sent Us.""I'm out here because it's so important that people vote and I'm telling people to vote blue for Biden and (running mate Kamala) Harris because Trump has been a disaster for our country," said Wendy Sacks, a 67-year-old vintage jewelry seller.Mask-wearing protesters marched in Chicago with the same message, banging drums and chanting for Trump's defeat.Next month's presidential contest was also the focus of a separate New York protest Saturday in which hundreds of demonstrators protested the killings of Black people by police officers.Among those protesting was Tamika Palmer, the mother of Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker killed by officers in March during a raid at her home in Louisville, Kentucky.A grand jury decided last month not to charge any of the police officers involved with her death; instead, one officer was charged with shooting into a neighboring home."People need to get out and vote," Palmer told those at the event.

Iran's Foreign Ministry has declared it as victory of "multilateralism, peace and security," despite Washington's pressure to reimpose sanctions.The arms embargo ends as part of Resolution 2231 of a landmark 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States, which gave Iran relief on sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.It means Iran will be legally able to both buy and sell conventional arms, including small arms, missiles, helicopters and tanks."As of today, all restrictions on the transfer of arms, related activities and financial services to and from The Islamic Republic of Iran, and all prohibitions regarding the entry or transit through territories of the United Nations Member States previously imposed on a number of Iranian citizens and military officials, are all automatically terminated," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said said in a statement on October 18.No special action was necessary from the Iranian side as the embargo lifts automatically if no extension or additional measures are taken by the Security Council, the statement said.Iran also said it was self-reliant in its defense and had no need to go on a weapons buying spree."Iran's defense doctrine is premised on strong reliance on its people and indigenous capabilities ... Unconventional arms, weapons of mass destruction and a buying spree of conventional arms have no place in Iran's defense doctrine," said in the statement.Tehran has made strides in ramping up its local production of conventional weapons and defensive capabilities under the pressure of multilateral sanctions over the past decades.Authorities have said Iran will be ready to sell arms when the embargo ends.In late August, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said it would be a "good idea" to consider purchasing missiles from Iran after rival Colombia said Maduro was looking into this plan.Although Tehran tends to exaggerate its weapons capabilities, concerns remain about its long-range ballistic missile program which contributed to Washington leaving the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.Tensions concerning arms control between Washington and Tehran have soared ever since.Related readings:Timeline: Is the landmark Iran nuclear deal coming to an end?From coup to Soleimani's assassination: Seven decades of US-Iran relations in picturesIn August this year, the Trump administration triggered a process aimed at restoring all UN sanctions, after the UN Security Council rejected a U.S. bid to extend the conventional arms embargo on the country.A month later, the U.S. unilaterally announced reinstating all UN sanctions on Iran that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal, a move which would automatically extend the arms embargo as well.The overwhelming majority of UNSC members rejected the bid, saying it has no legal basis. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also told the council he would not take any action on the U.S. declaration.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned it will have a "decisive response" if the U.S. tries to "bully" other nations into adhering to its reinstatement of sanctions.Last week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said during a news conference in Tehran the arms embargo will end on October 18 despite U.S. efforts to block it.However, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, together known as the E3, wrote a joint statement in July, saying that while E3 will remain committed to fully implement Resolution 2231 of the nuclear deal, they believe lifting of the arms embargo "would have major implications for regional security and stability.""We recall that the EU embargoes on conventional arms exports and missile technology will remain in force until 2023," they said.(With input from agencies)The international conventional arms embargo on Iran, imposed 13 years ago by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), was due to expire on Sunday.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also told the council he would not take any action on the U.S. declaration.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned it will have a "decisive response" if the U.S. tries to "bully" other nations into adhering to its reinstatement of sanctions.Last week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said during a news conference in Tehran the arms embargo will end on October 18 despite U.S. efforts to block it.However, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, together known as the E3, wrote a joint statement in July, saying that while E3 will remain committed to fully implement Resolution 2231 of the nuclear deal, they believe lifting of the arms embargo "would have major implications for regional security and stability.""We recall that the EU embargoes on conventional arms exports and missile technology will remain in force until 2023," they said.(With input from agencies)The foreign ministers of Austria and Belgium have both tested positive for coronavirus after attending a meeting with European Union colleagues this week.

According to the Azeri authorities, 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on September 27, but no military casualties have been released so far.In a televised address to the nation, Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, denounced the missile strike as a war crime and warned the leadership of Armenia that it would face responsibility."Azerbaijan will give its response and it will do so exclusively on the battlefield," Aliyev said.The Armenian Defense Ministry denied launching the Saturday strike, but the separatist officials in Nagorno-Karabakh put out a statement listing alleged "legitimate" military facilities in the city of Ganja, although they stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, came under intense shelling on Saturday, leaving three civilians wounded, according to the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities.The Azerbaijani military declared Saturday that they downed an Armenian Su-25 jet, a claim quickly dismissed by Armenia's Defense Ministry.

COVID-19 epidemic coupled with floods in southern China posed daunting challenges to the national fight against penury.  Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed at a symposium on securing a decisive victory in poverty alleviation in March that lifting all rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty by 2020 is a solemn promise made by the CPC Central Committee, and it must be fulfilled on time.The present poverty eradication goals consist of not only eliminating all instances of absolute poverty on schedule, but also consolidating the achievements of poverty reduction efforts, ensuring that people who have gotten out of poverty do not fall back into it."Being lifted out of poverty is not an end in itself but the starting point of a new life and a new pursuit," Xi said at the poverty alleviation symposium, emphasizing the need to synchronize poverty alleviation with rural revitalization.After China achieves building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, it must make all-out efforts to advance rural revitalization to further address issues such as the urban-rural imbalance, Xi said during an inspection tour to Sanjia Village in Tengchong CIty, southwest China's Yunnan Province in January. Liu Yongfu, director of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, highlighted that poverty alleviation should be a continuous and sustainable work, as "relative poverty" will still exist even after the country eliminates "absolute poverty" by 2020.Read more: Latest data reveal how far away China is from the 2020 poverty elimination goal Graphics: Ending China's poverty by 2020 Graphics by Chen YuyangOctober 17 marks China's National Poverty Relief Day, a reminder that the country has reached the final stage of its mission to eradicate extreme poverty by the end of 2020.With only 75 days left for the year, how far is China from achieving that goal and what's next?Most provinces and regions have already been declared free of absolute poverty. By the end of 2019, the number of poor rural residents in the country plunged from 98.99 million in 2012 to 5.51 million in 2019, showed data from China's National Bureau of Statistics.Read more about how China is leading global anti-poverty efforts How China is championing climate change mitigation and poverty reductionAnd the number of impecunious counties in China has fallen from 832 in 2015 to 52 in 2019, according to the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development.In 2020, 52 poverty-stricken counties in seven provinces and regions became key poverty-eradication battlegrounds.

No leader has achieved an absolute majority since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996, leading to multi-party governments' succession.While the count has not been finalized, the figures were enough for opposition leader Judith Collins to concede after phoning Ardern."Congratulations on your result because it is, I believe, an outstanding result for the Labour Party. It has been a tough campaign," Collins told cheering supporters in Auckland. Her conservative National Party was expected to take around 35 seats in what appears to be its worst result in nearly 20 years.Ardern's performance beat pre-election opinion polls and put Labour on course for its strongest showing since 1946.Party president Claire Szabo praised the charismatic leader's campaign, who sparked a wave of support dubbed "Jacinda-mania" when she took over the party in 2017 as it was languishing in the polls."There's no doubt the strong, great leadership we've had from Jacinda Ardern has been a massive factor in all this," she told NZ.Ardern had dubbed the vote "the Covid election" and campaigned on her government's success in eliminating community transmission of the virus, which has caused just 25 deaths in a population of five million.The pandemic is just one of a string of crises that showed Ardern's leadership qualities during a torrid first term. She displayed both empathy and decisive action on gun control after a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers in the Christchurch mosques attack last year.Ardern again found herself comforting a shocked nation when a volcanic eruption at White Island, also known as Whakaari, killed 21 people and left dozens more with horrific burns."No matter what crisis is thrown my way, you will always be assured I will give my everything to this job, even if that means a huge sacrifice," she said this week.A month after new COVID-19 infections in Auckland, the election was delayed, which led to a second lockdown in the country's largest city.Life is back to normal in New Zealand, but its borders are still shut, its tourism sector is bleeding, and economists predict a lasting recession after the harsh lockdowns.The economy shrank at a 12.2-percent annual clip in the second quarter, its steepest drop since the Great Depression.

It will go into effect on June 1, 2021.According to experts, the current existing law faces severe challenges due to the emergence of fresh social problems. For example, in some cases, the minors' guardians themselves are the domestic violence abusers; school bullying is frequent but often covered; numerous minors are addicted to online games and sexual abuses against minors are often conducted by people in close contact with the victims, like teachers, neighbors and relatives.As a response to theose problems, the revised law has formulated and improved related protective measures, clearly stipulated the responsibilities of parents, schools, society, government and judicial organs in safeguarding the well-being of minors.In terms of internet use by minors, the law highlighted that producers and sellers of network products should install online software for protecting minors or offer a clear information on how to install such a software.And they should also remind minors to protect their personal information and impose protective restrictions on minors' use of their personal information online. Without the consent of parents or other guardians, they're forbidden to collect, store and use minors' personal information.Besides, the new law urges schools to establish a mechanism to prevent school bullying, and provide training for faculties, staff and students in stopping school bullying. Schools and parents are also asked to provide psychological counseling and support to prevent psychological trauma of minors.Moreover, the law emphasized the importance of sex education and self-protection awareness of minors, asking related departments and organizations to conduct sex education that is appropriate for the minor's age.At the same time, the law introduced new job rules to further prevent child sex abuse, requiring kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and certification bodies that grant teacher qualifications must check the legal record of the job seekers and teaching candidates to exclude and disqualify those who have been charged with or convicted of child molestation or sexual abuses.China's freshly revised Law on the Protection of Minors was adopted with a vote at the 22nd Session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress on Saturday.The revised law, introduced in 1991 and revised in 2006, has significantly increased the number of articles from 72 to 130, adding two new chapters involved government protection and online protection for minors.The new law includes general provisions and protections for the areas of family, school, society, Internet, government, judiciary as well as legal responsibility and supplementary provisions.

recent diplomatic interactions with Southeast Asian countries have enhanced unity between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and deepened the cooperation of regional anti-pandemic fight, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Friday.He made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua after holding talks last week with Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesian president's special envoy, and Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and wrapped up Friday his Southeast Asia tour, which has taken him to Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand and Singapore.This is Wang's first tour to Southeast Asian countries in the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.Strengthen unityThe Chinese foreign minister believes that his visit has first of all enhanced the unity between China and the ASEAN."We have exchanged views and reached a series of consensus on major issues, such as jointly responding to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving international situation, deepening bilateral relations, maintaining regional peace and stability, and improving the global governance system," Wang said.He noted that all parties should further enhance mutual trust and solidarity, and continue to push forward the development of relations between China and ASEAN countries, so as to bring them to higher levels.Deepen cooperationFurthermore, cooperation on the fight against the pandemic has been deepened, Wang said.It is agreed that East Asia has made outstanding achievements in combating against COVID-19, which comes from countries' commitment to putting the people first, taking scientific epidemic prevention measures, sticking together and providing mutual assistance and support, Wang said.All parties should improve the level of joint prevention and control against the pandemic, enhance the exchange of prevention and treatment experience, and strengthen cooperation in vaccine research and development, production and use, he added.China, Wang said, will continue to help ASEAN countries to prevail over the pandemic, including providing necessary anti-epidemic materials, carrying out cooperation on vaccine, assisting the establishment of nucleic acid testing laboratories, supporting ASEAN in launching an anti-epidemic fund, and establishing repositories for emergency medical supplies.According to Wang, the Southeast countries have spoken highly of China's vaccine research and development and expressed the hope to conduct all-dimension cooperation with China in vaccine research and development, purchase, production and use.On the issue concerning the life and health of all mankind, the international community should cooperate with each other, he said, adding "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the necessary conditions for global vaccine development.China has made it clear that it is willing to make efforts within its capacity in vaccine development, and give priority to the needs of developing countries including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, he added.Promote economic recoveryThirdly, the economic recovery in post-pandemic era was promoted, Wang noted."All parties have spoken highly of China's major anti-epidemic achievements and its progress in the resumption of work and production, and they look forward to and believe that China will continue to be the main engine driving global economic recovery," Wang said.They all hope to take the opportunity of China's "dual circulation" development pattern and dock China's Belt and Road Initiative with their own countries' development strategies, so as to embark on the fast track of post-pandemic economic recovery as soon as possible, he said.Enhance regional peace and stabilityThe fourth is that the visits have strengthened regional peace and stability, said Wang.In the face of foreign forces stirring up trouble and creating tension in the South China Sea, Wang noted that the Chinese side has emphasized that the South China Sea should not become a sea for great powers to play games or for gunboats to overrun, which is generally recognized by all parties.The countries agreed to resolve differences through friendly consultation, fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea as well as endeavor for an early conclusion of a more binding and effective Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region, he added.Safeguard international equityFifth, the visits have safeguarded international equity and justice, Wang said.He said that the countries have expressed the need to oppose power politics and unilateral bullying, uphold the basic norms of international relations, firmly practice the concepts of multilateralism and win-win cooperation, and make joint efforts to promote democratization of international relations and multi-polarization of the world.Access to COVID-19 vaccineWang also reiterated China's willingness to make efforts within its capacity in vaccine development, and give priority to the needs of developing countries including the ASEAN countries.Speaking on how China will fulfill its commitment to make vaccines a global public good, Wang said that the virus knows no borders, and only when all countries get rid of the epidemic can the global fight against the COVID-19 be a final victory.Vaccines are the "ultimate weapon" to prevail over the epidemic, he said, calling on international community to working jointly on issues concerning the life and health of all mankind. "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the necessary conditions for global vaccine development.China will earnestly fulfill its commitment to make vaccines a global public product once they are successfully developed and put into use, and will contribute to the accessibility and affordability of the vaccines in developing countries, Wang pledged.'Dual circulation'Wang noted that a new economic development pattern featuring "dual circulation," in which domestic and overseas markets complement and reinforce each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay, has been a major strategic deployment by the Chinese government."China will promote high-quality development and build a new system of an open economy of a higher level," Wang said. "The scale of the domestic market will be further expanded. The combination of the domestic and international markets will be closer. There will be more room for cooperation between countries and China."ASEAN countries are in the best position to draw momentum from China's new development pattern and seize the opportunity, Wang noted, adding that they are also in the best position to expand mutual benefit and achieve economic recovery and better development with China.China's huge market size will first benefit its neighbors, providing ASEAN countries with a broader export market, said the Chinese minister.China is ready to work with ASEAN countries to implement an upgraded China-ASEAN Free Trade Area protocol and sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership within this year, continue to make the China International Import Expo and the China-ASEAN Expo a success, and import more products needed by the Chinese market from ASEAN countries, Wang said.(With input from Xinhua)The recent diplomatic interactions with Southeast Asian countries have enhanced unity between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and deepened the cooperation of regional anti-pandemic fight, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Friday.He made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua after holding talks last week with Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesian president's special envoy, and Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and wrapped up Friday his Southeast Asia tour, which has taken him to Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand and Singapore.This is Wang's first tour to Southeast Asian countries in the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.Strengthen unityThe Chinese foreign minister believes that his visit has first of all enhanced the unity between China and the ASEAN."We have exchanged views and reached a series of consensus on major issues, such as jointly responding to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving international situation, deepening bilateral relations, maintaining regional peace and stability, and improving the global governance system," Wang said.He noted that all parties should further enhance mutual trust and solidarity, and continue to push forward the development of relations between China and ASEAN countries, so as to bring them to higher levels.Deepen cooperationFurthermore, cooperation on the fight against the pandemic has been deepened, Wang said.It is agreed that East Asia has made outstanding achievements in combating against COVID-19, which comes from countries' commitment to putting the people first, taking scientific epidemic prevention measures, sticking together and providing mutual assistance and support, Wang said.All parties should improve the level of joint prevention and control against the pandemic, enhance the exchange of prevention and treatment experience, and strengthen cooperation in vaccine research and development, production and use, he added.China, Wang said, will continue to help ASEAN countries to prevail over the pandemic, including providing necessary anti-epidemic materials, carrying out cooperation on vaccine, assisting the establishment of nucleic acid testing laboratories, supporting ASEAN in launching an anti-epidemic fund, and establishing repositories for emergency medical supplies.According to Wang, the Southeast countries have spoken highly of China's vaccine research and development and expressed the hope to conduct all-dimension cooperation with China in vaccine research and development, purchase, production and use.On the issue concerning the life and health of all mankind, the international community should cooperate with each other, he said, adding "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the

Chinese President Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.China's economy faces challenges as the world is undergoing profound changes, the meeting said. As a significant part of the "dual circulation" strategy, the Chengdu-Chongqing economic rim will bring high-quality growth for the region, widen the market and stabilize the production chain and supply chain.The economic rim aims to make the two megacities important growth engines, innovation hubs, and desirable cities to live for the vast regions in western China, it said.The plan also asks Chengdu and Chongqing to play a leading role in China's Belt and Road Initiative and promote economic connectivity with regional countries.But the meeting didn't release a roadmap for the implementation of the strategy. 'Dual circulation' modelPresident Xi first raised the idea of "dual circulation" in May and later elaborated that China will rely mainly on "internal circulation" - the domestic cycle of production, distribution, and consumption - for its development, supported by innovation and upgrades of the economy.Xi also said "internal circulation" will be supported by "external circulation"."Dual circulation" is by no means a closed domestic loop, Xi has emphasized on different occasions, reaffirming that opening-up was a fundamental national policy.Speaking to local people during his recent inspection in Guangdong Province, Xi said he was there to send a clear message that China will continue to walk down the road of reform and opening-up. China must adhere to the opening-up policy in an all-round way and enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going global," Xi reasserted at the event marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ).Chengdu, located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, is known for its China Panda Base.

Each week we crunch the numbers in search of the trends that matter in the battle for the presidency.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionElection day in the United States is a little over two weeks away and more than 18.9 million Americans have already voted. Has the trajectory of campaign changed over the last week?The national pictureThe national polls have heavily favored Biden in the fallout period from the first presidential debate and Trump testing positive for COVID-19, and that trend has continued over the past seven days with the Democrat hitting the 50-percent mark for the first time in CGTN's analysis of publicly-available opinion polls.Biden stretched his lead over Trump from 8.3 points to 8.6 over the week, leaving him in a strong position and suggesting the president will need everything to go right in the swing states if he is to have a chance of re-election â and will have to make the second presidential debate, scheduled for October 22, count. High-quality individual national polls in recent days have consistently indicated Biden holds a double-digit lead, with YouGov, Reuters, NBC and NPR surveys suggesting Trump is down by at least 10 points.In the generic ballot, a measure of which party voters intend to back in congressional elections in November, Democrats are leading the Republicans by 7 points in the RealClearPolitics average, up from 6.6 a week earlier. While the Democrats appear likely to retain control of the House of Representatives, the battle for an all-important majority in the Senate remains neck and neck.The states that matterThe extent of Biden's national polling lead suggests he's almost certain to win the popular vote, just as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, but it's the individual states that matter in the Electoral College system.CGTN analysis of state polling indicates the Democrat has an advantage over Trump in many of the battlegrounds, though the margins are smaller than his national lead.Both Biden and Trump again campaigned in the pivotal state of Florida â now the president's home state â over the past week, and polling suggests the fight for its 29 electoral votes is narrowing: the Democrat has a 3.2-point lead, down from 3.4 points seven days ago.Trump held a televised town hall in Miami on Thursday following the cancellation of the second debate, as Biden took part in a similar event at the same time from Pennsylvania, the Midwestern state that the Republican is currently putting the most resources towards keeping in his column.Winning the Blue Wall of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin pushed Trump over the edge in 2016, but his campaign has diverted cash away from the latter two states over the past two weeks. Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes, is shaping up to be crucial: Biden holds a 6.2-point lead in the state of his birth, according to the polling averages, down from 6.3 a week ago.Polls only provide a snapshot in time and have a margin of error, but the state-by-state surveys suggest if the election were held today Biden could be on course to win 355 Electoral College votes to Trump's 183, unchanged since last week.Twitter rowsCGTN is using exclusive AI technology to weigh sentiment towards tweets related to the election, updating every 24 hours to reflect whether comments about Trump and Biden are positive, negative or neutral.Sentiment towards the candidates followed a familiar pattern over the past seven days, with tweets related to Trump a net negative 4.2 by daily average and tweets related to Biden net positive 7.9. Twitter itself was at the center of two election-related storms over the past week, suspending fake accounts claiming to be run by Black supporters of Trump only after being alerted to the issue by a newspaper investigation and then blocking an unsubstantiated New York Post article about Hunter Biden, the son of the Democratic nominee. The decision to block the URL of the Biden article and lock the account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, after she posted the link, led to uproar from Republicans.Money talksIn the money stakes, the two candidates are on very different tracks in the final stretch of the election.The Biden campaign and its affiliated committees set a new monthly fundraising record by hauling in $383 million in September, a huge $135.2 million more than Trump and his affiliates' $247.8 million.The Democrat's big cash advantage in the closing stages of the race is already evident in how the campaigns are spending their money.Trump, with $251.4 million on hand at the start of October, according to his campaign, cancelled ad buys in Midwestern states he probably needs to win and diverted cash to Sunbelt states that he simply cannot afford to lose.Biden, with $432 million in reserve, expanded his spending into traditionally Republican states including Texas, where polling suggests he only narrowly trails the president. The combination of polling numbers and cash on hand favoring the Democrat mean that with a little more than two weeks to go, the Trump campaign is on the defensive while Biden is in a strong position to attack as the campaigns head towards Thursday's final debate. (Graphics by Li Yueyun)Scan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.Joe Biden and Donald Trump resumed something like a traditional presidential campaign over the past seven days with the clock ticking ever closer to the November 3 election day in the United States.The Democrat and Republican candidates crisscrossed the country to meet voters and win airtime, with the former vice president using his cash advantage â after another record-breaking fundraising month in September â to expand his ad buys and put the president's campaign on the back foot in Texas, North Carolina, Iowa and Georgia, all states Trump won comfortably in 2016.CGTN's interactive page offers in-depth analysis of the 2020 election, with exclusive data covering national and state-by-state polling, online sentiment and fundraising.

Minister Wang Yi stressed on Friday.In an article titled "Two Decades of a Shared Journey toward New Heights in the New Era" to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese foreign minister called for increasing cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, and achieving greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.According to Wang, in the last 20 years, the FOCAC has witnessed the consolidation of the political foundation of both sides, fruitful practical cooperation results, increased people-to-people exchange and strengthened mutual support.He said the FOCAC is a source of inspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations as the two sides have always pursued solidarity, consultation, and cooperation, advanced win-win cooperation for development, supported each other in trying times and embraced openness and inclusiveness.Looking into the future, Wang said China and Africa should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for the mankind, set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation and unleash a greater potential in practical cooperation.Here is the full text of Wang's article:This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). On October 12, President Xi Jinping and President Macky Sall of Senegal, the current African Co-Chair of the FOCAC, issued a joint congratulatory message to mark this important occasion. Embracing the dawn of the new century and the trend of peace and development 20 years ago, China and our brothers in Africa decided to initiate the FOCAC to promote win-win cooperation. Since then, the family of China and African nations has had its own platform for collective dialogue and mechanism for practical cooperation, ushering in a brand new chapter in China-Africa relations.IThe past 20 years have been a journey of productive cooperation. The FOCAC has bolstered high-level interactions and political trust between China and Africa, delivering a leap in China-Africa relations from "a new type of partnership" to "a new type of strategic partnership" and to "a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership."China-Africa cooperation has made impressive achievements. In 2019, direct Chinese investment stock in Africa topped $49.1 billion, up by nearly 100 times from the year 2000; China-Africa trade reached $208.7 billion, 20 times the size of 2000. China has been Africa's largest trading partner for 11 years in a row, and has contributed more than 20 percent to Africa's growth for a number of years. Many flagship projects, such as the African Union (AU) Conference Center, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, and the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, among many others, have been completed and put into use. Cooperation in other fields, ranging from science, education, culture and health to people-to-people exchange, peace and security, has also made significant headway.Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), President Xi Jinping has set great store by China's relations with Africa. He personally laid down principles guiding China's Africa policy, including sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and pursuing the greater good and shared interests, and called for building a stronger China-Africa community with a shared future. His devotion to leadership diplomacy with Africa has given a strong boost to the relations between the two sides.The political foundation has been cemented. In 2013, President Xi Jinping chose Africa as the destination of his first overseas visit as the Head of State of China. So far, he has visited Africa four times, covering all sub-regions of the continent. In 2015 and 2018, Chinese and African leaders convened two historic FOCAC summits: one in Johannesburg and another in Beijing. In June this year, the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19 was held at a critical moment in tackling the coronavirus. Political interactions between the two sides are more frequent, extensive and unprecedented in scale. For example, on the sidelines of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, President Xi Jinping attended more than 70 bilateral and multilateral events in eight days. With the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Gambia, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, and Burkina Faso, the China-Africa family has been further expanded.Practical cooperation has been fruitful. China-Africa economic and trade cooperation has been growing at a higher speed, demonstrating three encouraging shifts: from government-driven to market-driven, from trade in goods to industrial cooperation, and from engineering contracts to investment and operations. Together, the two sides have drafted and implemented 10 cooperation plans and eight major initiatives, taking practical cooperation to a new level. China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation is progressing with a strong momentum: 44 African countries and the AU Commission have signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, and a host of projects such as railways, roads, airports, ports and power stations have come to fruition, enabling remarkable change in Africa's economic and social development.People-to-people exchanges have been thriving. Events across a diverse range of areas, including the China-Africa Youth Festival, the Think Tank Forum, the Joint Research and Exchange Program, the Poverty Reduction and Development Conference, and the China-Africa Press Center, have been successful. And the China-Africa Institute has been inaugurated. So far, China has provided about 120,000 government scholarships to African countries, set up 61 Confucius Institutes and 44 Confucius Classrooms in collaboration with 46 African countries, sent 21,000 doctors and nurses in medical teams to 48 African countries, treating around 220 million African patients, and forged 150 pairs of sister cities. All these efforts have consolidated popular support for China-Africa friendship.Mutual support has been further strengthened. China and Africa fought side by side against both Ebola and COVID-19. The two sides have supported each other on issues of each other's core interests and major concerns. China-Africa peace and security cooperation has been enhanced. The two sides have jointly supported multilateralism, opposed unilateralism and protectionism, safeguarded the international order and international system with the United Nations at the core, and promoted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other basic norms governing international relations. Such collaboration has effectively upheld the shared interests of developing countries as well as the overall interests of the whole international community.IIThe past 20 years have been a journey of overcoming challenges and enhancing partnerships. The FOCAC has withstood the test of the volatile international landscape, and scored historic achievements. It is a vivid epitome of China's pioneering efforts in foreign affairs under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. It is also a source of aspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations.We have always pursued solidarity, consultation and cooperation. China is the largest developing country and the African continent home to the largest number of developing countries. When China-Africa cooperation prospers, South-South cooperation will prosper. When the voice of the 2.6 billion people in China and Africa are heeded and respected, the world will have genuine fairness and justice.From the very beginning, we have always taken China-Africa relations as part of South-South cooperation, and have advanced the FOCAC in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. The FOCAC, composed of China and 53 African countries and the AU, is by no means "one vs. 54", but "54 plus one". We would sit down in consultation whenever there is an issue, and solve it through discussion. And that is the guiding principle for our conduct. China has never interfered in African countries' pursuit of development paths that suit their own national conditions, never imposed its will upon others, never attached any political strings to its assistance, and never sought selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation.We have attached great importance to the Forum's role in drafting overall plans and providing strategic guidance, and we have paid equal attention to China's ties with each FOCAC member, so that the Forum mechanism and bilateral cooperation can complement each other in forging a strong network of partnerships between and among countries. The Forum has significantly increased the international profile of China-Africa relations, and has become a pacesetter for South-South cooperation and cooperation by the international community with Africa.We have always advanced win-win cooperation for development. Both China and Africa are at a crucial stage of development and rejuvenation. The Chinese and African peoples are entitled to live a better life. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that no one could hold back the Chinese people or the African people as we march toward rejuvenation. Cooperation and development have always been FOCAC's top priority. We have fully leveraged our unique strengths, such as the great complementarity between our economies and development stages. We have developed greater synergy between our development strategies and embarked on a path of win-win cooperation with distinctive features.Our cooperation is about action and results. Every three years, the FOCAC rolls out a package action plan. The 2018 Beijing Summit alone produced more than 880 deliverables. We always deliver and we do not make empty promises. We have kept pace with the times and kept our mind open to break new ground and tide over challenging times. According to African friends, the FOCAC is a cooperation mechanism that truly delivers.We have always supported each other in trying times. China-Africa friendship was born in the formidable years of national liberation and is deeply rooted in our peoples' heart. As President Xi said, China and Africa are friends tested by adversity, and such friends must never be forgotten.During the 2008 international financial crisis, China and Africa rendered each other valuable support. Instead of reducing assistance, China bucked the trend and increased its support to Africa. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, when others chose to leave, Chinese doctors and nurses braved their lives and rushed to the hard-hit regions to help local people fight the disease, writing an indelible chapter in the history of humanitarian assistance of the People's Republic of China. Faced with the onslaught of COVID-19 worldwide, China and Africa have again stood shoulder to shoulder to help each other.What we have gone through together shows that China and Africa are more than just partners. We are comrades-in-arms. The more severe the difficulties, the more determined and confident we are about China-Africa cooperation, and the more capable the FOCAC is in pooling our strengths to forge ahead, making itself the key driving force for the time-honored China-Africa friendship.We have always embraced openness and inclusiveness. The FOCAC was established to answer the call of the times for peace, development and win-win cooperation. It serves as a fine example of multilateralism. China and Africa have all along upheld the principle of openness and inclusiveness. A closed-door policy or exclusiveness is never an option. Colonial plunder and the Cold-War rivalry brought excruciating sufferings to the African people. That part of history must not be repeated. Africa must never again be an arena for major-power rivalry. This belief is widely shared by people across Africa, and should be respected by the entire international community.Openness is vital in cooperation with Africa. It is important to share experience and learn from one another, so that Africa's peace and development can benefit from the common effort and contribution of the international community. Africa's cooperation with China has improved its development capacity and business environment, which in turn has created favorable conditions for other countries' cooperation with the continent. China has taken part in more Africa-related trilateral and multilateral cooperation in recent years. We commend and encourage such cooperation and will continue our support.IIIThe past 20 years have been a journey of China and Africa coming together as one community with a shared future. Today, the world is being shaped by changes unseen in a century, a process accelerated by COVID-19. China and Africa are good friends, partners and brothers, and more importantly, an important force for world peace and development. In this changing world, China and Africa need to stay united and work more closely together to make the FOCAC a greater success and further strengthen China-Africa relations, so as to further enhance our friendship and justice in the world.China and Africa can and should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind. The more complex and fluid the international landscape is, the greater the imperative for China and Africa to adhere to the fundamental direction of building a China-Africa community with a shared future. We should continue to follow the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith as well as the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. We need to maintain the momentum of high-level exchange, share more governance experience with each other, build a stronger bond between the Chinese and African peoples, and continue to elevate the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. We need to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, step up mutual support on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and work together for greater democracy in international relations. We need to take the side of the overwhelming majority of the international community, stay committed to multilateralism, and align global governance reforms with the common interests of developing countries. With these efforts, we will make the China-Africa relationship a trailblazer and a shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind.China and Africa can and should set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation. China and Africa have fought hard for what we have achieved in tackling COVID-19. As the virus continues to spread globally, both China and Africa are confronted with the formidable task of combating the virus while stabilizing the economy and protecting people's livelihoods. We will speed up the implementation of the important measures that President Xi Jinping announced at the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, and make China's contribution to making vaccines accessible and affordable for African countries as soon as possible. China will continue to provide COVID-19 containment supplies, send expert teams, and facilitate Africa's procurement of medical supplies from China. China will strive for breaking ground for the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters by the end of this year. These are concrete actions that will show the world that China and Africa have the determination and strength to defeat COVID-19 together.China and Africa can and should unleash greater potential in practical cooperation. COVID-19 will not hamper China-Africa cooperation. As one of the first countries to fully reopen the economy, China aims to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will bring new opportunities for China and Africa to deepen, transform and upgrade their cooperation. China supports Africa's effort to develop the African Continental Free Trade Area. We encourage Chinese companies and financial institutions to take an active part in infrastructure connectivity projects in Africa, which will facilitate cross-border logistics and customs clearance. We are ready to work with the international community in supporting Africa's integration process and sub-regional economic community-building. China hopes to work with Africa to deepen the integration of our industrial and supply chains, and encourages Chinese businesses to invest and conduct technological cooperation in Africa. We will support Africa's agricultural modernization and industrialization drive to raise the added value and competitiveness of Africa's exported energy, mineral and agricultural products. China will work with the international community to support Africa's integration into the global industrial and supply chains. China and Africa should to join hands in pursuing green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. This will contribute to African countries' ability to tackle climate change.As an ancient Chinese saying goes: "Having scaled a cloud-shrouded mountain peak, we rest our horses and set sail for the vast ocean." The China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward. The development of the FOCAC will never take a break. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will continue to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and, with the personal commitment and support of Chinese and African leaders, increase the cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, tighten China-Africa ties against all odds, and achieve greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward and the development of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) will never pause, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed on Friday.In an article titled "Two Decades of a Shared Journey toward New Heights in the New Era" to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese foreign minister called for increasing cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, and achieving greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.According to Wang, in the last 20 years, the FOCAC has witnessed the consolidation of the political foundation of both sides, fruitful practical cooperation results, increased people-to-people exchange and strengthened mutual support.He said the FOCAC is a source of inspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations as the two sides have always pursued solidarity, consultation, and cooperation, advanced win-win cooperation for development, supported each other in trying times and embraced openness and inclusiveness.Looking into the future, Wang said China and Africa should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for the mankind, set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation and unleash a greater potential in practical cooperation.Here is the full text of Wang's article:This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). On October 12, President Xi Jinping and President Macky Sall of Senegal, the current African Co-Chair of the FOCAC, issued a joint congratulatory message to mark this important occasion. Embracing the dawn of the new century and the trend of peace and development 20 years ago, China and our brothers in Africa decided to initiate the FOCAC to promote win-win cooperation.

After falling by four million at the start of the pandemic because of a $2 trillion emergency federal aid package called the Cares Act, the number of poor people in the U.S. has risen by eight million since May.The University of Chicago and Notre Dame studies found poverty grew by six million people but unlike Columbia University, Chicago and Notre Dame show poverty has continued to grow rather than improve.Bruce D. Meyer, an economist at the University of Chicago and an author of the study told the New York Times these numbers are concerning. "They tell us people are having a lot more trouble paying their bills, paying their rent, putting food on the table," he said. The studies attribute the COVID-19 pandemic and the loss of the Cares Act to the rise in poverty. Columbia researchers say this aid helped keep more than 18 million people out of poverty during its peak in May.The program expanded unemployment benefits and provided stimulus checks for families. And while the Democrats in the House of Representatives has passed multi trillion-dollar aid package, the Republican led Senate has proposed smaller plans, leading to gridlock between both parties.The new studies from Chicago and Notre Dame also show poverty and the pandemic are impacting minority groups the hardest. "Black people and Latinos are more than twice as likely as white people to be poor," according to the studies.Based off new unemployment numbers, the AP reports the economy is still about 10.7 million jobs away from recovering the 22 million jobs lost when the pandemic started.Thursday's unemployment numbers also don't include California, which typically represents about one-fourth of unemployment claims in the country. The state paused processing new claims for two weeks so they could sort through a backlog of claims and implement fraud prevention technology.But unemployment applications rose in 17 other states.

"But we know that's not going to happen in foreseeable future."For the U.S., urging China to engage in trilateral negotiations is "nothing but a ploy to divert attention" and an excuse for the U.S. to walk away from the New START extension.Fu maintained that China is not shying away from the international nuclear disarmament process and it actually plays an active role in pushing forward international disarmament within the framework of the United Nations.China's disarmament diplomat Fu Cong on Thursday challenged U.S. claims on nuclear strategy transparency and nuclear arsenal, as Washington has repeatedly called for China to join the so-called trilateral negotiations with Russia.In terms of strategic calculation and avoiding miscalculation, China's nuclear strategy and intention are more transparent and predictable, as China pledges no-first-use of nuclear weapons and never use or threaten to employ nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states, said Fu, head of the arms control department of China's foreign ministry, in an interview with Russian newspaper Kommersant.Fu asserted that China pursues a self-defensive nuclear strategy, serving the purposes of safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and China takes nuclear weapons as the "ultimate deterrence," rejecting U.S. allegations of the so-called China threat.Out of safety and security concerns, China's modernizing its nuclear capacity, and we hope the international society could take an unbiased view on China's effort, Fu said.In fact nuclear forces of other nuclear powers are also undergoing modernization, and the U.S. even plans to inject $1.2 trillion to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, he pointed out.The U.S., with about 6,000 nuclear warheads, is expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence, Fu said, adding that this doctrine poses real threat to other countries.Fu reiterated that China will not participate in trilateral arms control negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to extend the New START, a flagship nuclear arms treaty between the two countries that is due to expire next February.Pressuring China to join such negotiations is "unfair, unreasonable and unfeasible," Fu said, given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is about 20 times the size of China's.China would "be happy to" participate in such talks with the U.S. and Russia, but only if the U.S. agrees to reduce its nuclear arsenal to China's level, Fu said.

China's mass coordinated testing and targeted containment model, as shown with recent outbreaks in Beijing, Dalian and Urumqi, have proved continually successful in quashing a return of the virus, allowing life to continue as normal."This is totally different from how most European and other Western countries have approached the pandemic. Most countries still aren't conducting adequate tests. In countries such as Poland, France, Italy and Spain, mostly only the symptomatic cases are being tested and the positive cases are advised home quarantine and not immediate hospitalization as in China. And this is a huge mistake," said Dr Agnieszka Bielewicz, internal medicine specialist at ParkWayHealth, one of China's leading international healthcare providers.She noted that the European countries would do well to follow Qingdao's example. "When I say all the 9-10 million people in Qingdao are being tested, many in Europe find it hard to believe. I keep repeating that China's approach in fighting the pandemic has been absolutely outstanding and this is why people in China, including the foreigners, are really enjoying a mostly normal life now because we are free."Bielewicz, who has been living in China with her husband and three kids for over eight years, admitted however that she feels the pangs of "survival guilty" at times because her friends and relatives back in Poland cannot experience the same freedoms."It is a strange feeling. COVID-19 is not only affecting human life and health, it is affecting people's minds very deeply â their characters and feelings. It has turned our life upside down. Today, COVID-19 is affecting even global politics, economy, and each aspect of our life," she remarked thoughtfully.'I'm a doctor, I cannot give up'While the doctor now worries about her kith and kin in her home country, during the initial days of the outbreak when as a healthcare worker she was tending to her duties, it was her family and friends in Poland who were deeply concerned about her, as China was the epicenter of the pandemic at the time."As a foreign doctor, I was designated to work for the Chinese New Year holiday when all of my Chinese colleagues were to celebrate with their family. When the outbreak happened, I was already working. As the situation became uncertain, I decided to send my family back to Poland," she recalled."The entire time my family was in Poland, they were worried about my situation, about my work. And to this extent that they called me several times a day to check whether I have any symptoms," she said, noting the healthcare workers were at the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 and therefore more prone to infection."My family was really terrified that I was still working, but I'm a doctor, I cannot give up. I explained to them that due to the safety protocols and all the rules strictly introduced and implemented, I felt very safe even during the peak of the outbreak in China," she said.Bielewicz was fortunate to be reunited with her family before the international travel restrictions came into force and situation in Europe worsened. "With China enforcing strict prevention and control measures, things were improving here. I told my family that it is very safe here and they returned early March. Thankfully, my children didn't have to experience the full lockdown anywhere and they came back at a good time."'China is doing better than the rest'With COVID-19 subsequently spreading in Europe and other parts of the world, the world also witnessed a sustained campaign of disinformation against China and COVID-19, triggered by geopolitics.Bielewicz, as a health professional with a closer insight into the situation on the ground, felt compelled to clear some of the doubts through media appearances in Polish TV. At the time, people in Europe thought that the COVID-19 situation was horrific in China, that the hospitals were overcrowded, and that patients were dying in droves.The exaggerated media reports were laughable, the Polish doctor felt. "I gave several interviews to Polish TV channels explaining to them that the situation wasn't so crazy. We weren't dying [in droves]. We were not hungry. I showed them the photos of life in Shanghai, the buses, shops and streets. We could still use 'kuaidi' [express delivery] to buy things that we wanted," she elucidated.Bielewicz said people still find it hard to believe how successful China's COVID-19 fight has been. "Many people ask my mom, who is a nurse in Poland, about the situation in China and when she tells them that China has nearly curbed COVID-19 with almost zero local transmission and most new cases being imported, people react in disbelieve. They say it is impossible."The Polish healthcare professional felt that this is symptomatic of the Western media narrative that has constantly pushed a narrative of China as a "third-world" country and therefore people find it difficult to believe that "China is doing better than we are doing."Will there be a second wave?While the recent Qingdao outbreak has prompted fears about a second wave, more so, as the winter flu season is approaching in China, Bielewicz expressed confidence about the protocols and measures in place even if there's a spike."I'm not worried too much over a second wave in China. We just witnessed how everything was controlled in Qingdao and we also know the exact source," she said. The health professional, however, strongly advocated for flu vaccination."I and all of my family members, we have flu vaccination and I encourage my patients, especially those with existing ailments such as like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetic and obesity to take vaccination for flu. I also suggest to take a pneumococcal vaccination because it protects lives," she said."Besides, I've been a big fan of Vitamin D which helps in boosting our immune system and making our bodies stronger.

China's mass coordinated testing and targeted containment model, as shown with recent outbreaks in Beijing, Dalian and Urumqi, have proved continually successful in quashing a return of the virus, allowing life to continue as normal."This is totally different from how most European and other Western countries have approached the pandemic. Most countries still aren't conducting adequate tests. In countries such as Poland, France, Italy and Spain, mostly only the symptomatic cases are being tested and the positive cases are advised home quarantine and not immediate hospitalization as in China. And this is a huge mistake," said Dr Agnieszka Bielewicz, internal medicine specialist at ParkWayHealth, one of China's leading international healthcare providers.She noted that the European countries would do well to follow Qingdao's example. "When I say all the 9-10 million people in Qingdao are being tested, many in Europe find it hard to believe. I keep repeating that China's approach in fighting the pandemic has been absolutely outstanding and this is why people in China, including the foreigners, are really enjoying a mostly normal life now because we are free."Bielewicz, who has been living in China with her husband and three kids for over eight years, admitted however that she feels the pangs of "survival guilty" at times because her friends and relatives back in Poland cannot experience the same freedoms."It is a strange feeling. COVID-19 is not only affecting human life and health, it is affecting people's minds very deeply â their characters and feelings. It has turned our life upside down. Today, COVID-19 is affecting even global politics, economy, and each aspect of our life," she remarked thoughtfully.'I'm a doctor, I cannot give up'While the doctor now worries about her kith and kin in her home country, during the initial days of the outbreak when as a healthcare worker she was tending to her duties, it was her family and friends in Poland who were deeply concerned about her, as China was the epicenter of the pandemic at the time."As a foreign doctor, I was designated to work for the Chinese New Year holiday when all of my Chinese colleagues were to celebrate with their family. When the outbreak happened, I was already working. As the situation became uncertain, I decided to send my family back to Poland," she recalled."The entire time my family was in Poland, they were worried about my situation, about my work. And to this extent that they called me several times a day to check whether I have any symptoms," she said, noting the healthcare workers were at the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 and therefore more prone to infection."My family was really terrified that I was still working, but I'm a doctor, I cannot give up. I explained to them that due to the safety protocols and all the rules strictly introduced and implemented, I felt very safe even during the peak of the outbreak in China," she said.Bielewicz was fortunate to be reunited with her family before the international travel restrictions came into force and situation in Europe worsened. "With China enforcing strict prevention and control measures, things were improving here. I told my family that it is very safe here and they returned early March. Thankfully, my children didn't have to experience the full lockdown anywhere and they came back at a good time."'China is doing better than the rest'With COVID-19 subsequently spreading in Europe and other parts of the world, the world also witnessed a sustained campaign of disinformation against China and COVID-19, triggered by geopolitics.Bielewicz, as a health professional with a closer insight into the situation on the ground, felt compelled to clear some of the doubts through media appearances in Polish TV. At the time, people in Europe thought that the COVID-19 situation was horrific in China, that the hospitals were overcrowded, and that patients were dying in droves.The exaggerated media reports were laughable, the Polish doctor felt. "I gave several interviews to Polish TV channels explaining to them that the situation wasn't so crazy. We weren't dying [in droves]. We were not hungry. I showed them the photos of life in Shanghai, the buses, shops and streets. We could still use 'kuaidi' [express delivery] to buy things that we wanted," she elucidated.Bielewicz said people still find it hard to believe how successful China's COVID-19 fight has been. "Many people ask my mom, who is a nurse in Poland, about the situation in China and when she tells them that China has nearly curbed COVID-19 with almost zero local transmission and most new cases being imported, people react in disbelieve. They say it is impossible."The Polish healthcare professional felt that this is symptomatic of the Western media narrative that has constantly pushed a narrative of China as a "third-world" country and therefore people find it difficult to believe that "China is doing better than we are doing."Will there be a second wave?While the recent Qingdao outbreak has prompted fears about a second wave, more so, as the winter flu season is approaching in China, Bielewicz expressed confidence about the protocols and measures in place even if there's a spike."I'm not worried too much over a second wave in China. We just witnessed how everything was controlled in Qingdao and we also know the exact source," she said. The health professional, however, strongly advocated for flu vaccination."I and all of my family members, we have flu vaccination and I encourage my patients, especially those with existing ailments such as like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetic and obesity to take vaccination for flu. I also suggest to take a pneumococcal vaccination because it protects lives," she said."Besides, I've been a big fan of Vitamin D which helps in boosting our immune system and making our bodies stronger. This can help our body fight the virus better in case of an infection," she added.Interviewer and script: Abhishek G BhayaVideo editors: Chen Shi &amp; Li YahuiCover image: Li JingjieDirector: Mei YanMore CGTN Interviews:'China's carbon neutral goal: Bold and inspiring''When China and U.S. work together, the entire world wins' Radical China-U.S. decoupling will throw humanity back by decadese-RMB: China gears up for digital payment 2.0Currency War: Will China's e-RMB fade out dollar's global sheen?TikTok, Huawei and Trump's tech war on ChinaHimalayan crossroads: A bumpy road ahead for China-India tiesTracing the origin and ecology of coronavirusInnovative China drives the global AI revolutionChina-India-Pakistan cooperation key for unleashing South Asia's full potentialPost-Brexit UK needs a 'balanced approach' towards China and an FTAHK &amp; U.S.: A tale of two protests and Trump's doublespeak'Hong Kong protest is pure bigotry and racism'India's COVID-19 lockdown and its side effectsMERS experience, China's situation shaped S Korea's COVID-19 strategyPost COVID-19, tourism could be 'slow' but 'smart'From dreams to doubts: Chinese students reconsider U.S. options amid COVID-19 worriesChina's night economy surges amid COVID-19 lifestyle changesTOP HEADLINES- Germany has reported a record 6,638 new infections in the past 24 hours.

a higher starting point toward further success. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks during an inspection tour in south China's Guangdong Province this week. Read more:'Reform and opening-up' remains theme of Xi Jinping's visit to China's Guangdong ProvinceXi sends 'clear message':

the planning of economic and social development during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). Heritage protection Xi visited local cultural and historical landmarks, including an ancient bridge, an old gate tower and a street lined with memorial archways, in the city of Chaozhou on Monday. Hailing the city's culture as an important part of the larger Chinese culture, Xi called Chaozhou's intangible cultural heritage represented by the region's embroidery, porcelain, wood carving, sculpture, opera, tea and cuisine precious treasures of the Chinese culture. The president has always insisted that the protection and exploration of cultural heritage assets must serve a country's development.In October 2018, Xi stressed that more importance should be attached to preserving history and culture in urban planning and construction during his visit to Xiguan historical and cultural community in the Liwan District of Guangzhou City.He stressed better protection of the city's heritage, noting that proactive efforts should be made to train inheritors of the intangible cultural legacy. Self-innovation Xi later visited Chaozhou Three-Circle (Group) Co., Ltd., a leading manufacturer of electronic components and advanced materials, to learn about the company's indigenous innovation and its research on key technologies. Independent innovation is key to the growth of companies, the upgrade of industries and the high-quality development of the economy, he said.At the exhibition hall, laboratory and production workshop of the company, Xi inspected featured products and learned about its research on key technologies. "Now we are undergoing major changes unseen in a century, and we need to take the road of self-reliance on a higher level," said Xi.Further reform and opening-up During a visit to Shantou on Tuesday, Xi urged the city to promote reform and opening-up at a higher starting point and keep abreast with others in the development of special economic zones in the new era. Xi also visited a museum of correspondence from overseas Chinese, where he said the Shantou Special Economic Zone (SEZ) should guide and encourage overseas Chinese to play bigger roles in supporting and participating in China's modernization, promoting Chinese culture, facilitating peace and unity of the country and deepening exchanges and cooperation between China and the world. Talking with residents and tourists at an old downtown area in Shantou, Xi said on the 40th anniversary of the SEZs, his visit to Shantou SEZ is a statement to both China and the international community that the CPC will lead the Chinese people in unswervingly following the path of reform and opening-up, working hard to advance socialist modernization, and striving to realize the Chinese

lodged solemn representations with the U.S. for imposing sanctions on Chinese personnel, said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday.China will take countermeasures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and relevant personnel if the United States insists on going down the wrong path, Zhao stressed.The U.S. State Department on Wednesday warned international financial institutions that if they were found doing business with relevant individuals in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, they could soon face tough sanctions.China urged the United States to correct its mistake and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way.The HKSAR government in a statement released on Thursday strongly opposed and condemned the report issued by the United States under the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Act, calling it groundless and irresponsible.Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society has regained stability, national security has been guaranteed in the city and residents can again enjoy basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, said the statement.The "sanctions" by the United States have no legal effect on financial institutions in Hong Kong, and the chief executive and other officials targeted by the U.S. have made it clear that they will continue to carry out their duty of safeguarding national security in Hong Kong in accordance with the law, the statement added.The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese foreign ministry in the HKSAR Thursday also expressed firm opposition to and solemnly refuted to the so-called report.A spokesperson of the office said the U.S. ignored the fact that Hong Kong is becoming more stable and better, and the mainstream public opinion is that Hong Kong society is regrouping and starting again, and the principle of international law of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries should be respected.The U.S. side concocted the so-called Law, defamed the national security law in Hong Kong, smeared the actions taken by the central government of China and the HKSAR government to set things right, imposed sanctions on officials of the central government of China and the HKSAR government, and propped up those who are anti-China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong. This has once again exposed the sinister intentions of the U.S. in its attempt to contain China's development, the spokesperson said. However, the wrong words and deeds of the U.S. cannot stop the steady and enduring growth of "One Country, Two Systems" and the prospect of Hong Kong's integration into the development of the country. The spokesperson stressed that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. The U.S. should correct its mistakes and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs in any way. China will continue to take resolute and effective measures to safeguard the interests of national sovereignty and security and safeguard the lawful rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and related personnel. (With input from Xinhua)China firmly opposed and strongly condemned the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Law concocted by the United States and its decision to sanction people, and has lodged solemn representations with the U.S. for imposing sanctions on Chinese personnel, said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday.China will take countermeasures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and relevant personnel if the United States insists on going down the wrong path, Zhao stressed.The U.S. State Department on Wednesday warned international financial institutions that if they were found doing business with relevant individuals in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, they could soon face tough sanctions.China urged the United States to correct its mistake and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way.The HKSAR government in a statement released on Thursday strongly opposed and condemned the report issued by the United States under the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Act, calling it groundless and irresponsible.Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society has regained stability, national security has been guaranteed in the city and residents can again enjoy basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, said the statement.The "sanctions" by the United States have no legal effect on financial institutions in Hong Kong, and the chief executive and other officials targeted by the U.S. have made it clear that they will continue to carry out their duty of safeguarding national security in Hong Kong in accordance with the law, the statement added.The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese foreign ministry in the HKSAR Thursday also expressed firm opposition to and solemnly refuted to the so-called report.A spokesperson of the office said the U.S. ignored the fact that Hong Kong is becoming more stable and better, and the mainstream public opinion is that Hong Kong society is regrouping and starting again, and the principle of international law of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries should be respected.The U.S. side concocted the so-called Law, defamed the national security law in Hong Kong, smeared the actions taken by the central government of China and the HKSAR government to set things right, imposed sanctions on officials of the central government of China and the HKSAR government, and propped up those who are anti-China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong.

Putin also voiced concern about the involvement in the conflict by militants from the Middle East â a reference to Turkey deploying Syrian fighters to combat Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.The two leaders "stressed the urgent need for joint efforts to end the bloodshed as soon as possible and move to a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem," according to a Kremlin readout of the call.

Armenia's Defense Ministry responded by stating that it reserves the right to target Azerbaijani military objects and troop movements.So far, Armenia and Azerbaijan have denied targeting each other's territory in the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, although each of the parties often contested the denials.An expansion of hostilities could trigger a dangerous escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994. The Armenian forces have also controlled significant chunks of Azerbaijani territory outside the separatist region.The mutual accusations and threats raised concern about the safety of a strategic pipeline that carries Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea crude oil to Turkey and on to Western markets.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev threatened "very heavy response," should Armenia "carry out its plans to destroy" oil and gas pipelines in Azerbaijan.The failure of the truce that was supposed to begin Saturday reflects the uncompromising positions of the two South Caucasus nations that have stymied decades of diplomatic efforts.

But in a world ravaged by man-made and natural disasters, the UN food body soon became synonymous with survival for millions facing hunger and starvation. On October 9, the WFP's 17,000 employees were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for fighting a relentless war against hunger in conflict zones in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Speaking exclusively to CGTN Digital, the WFP's deputy executive director Amir Mahmoud Abdulla described the recognition as a "great honor" and "quite humbling."The Norwegian Nobel Committee lauded the WFP for its efforts in "preventing the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict."Calling hunger "the world's biggest solvable problem," Abdulla said the award raises the organization's profile and draws the world's attention toward the link between hunger and conflict, and hunger and COVID-19. "It's not just about being able to raise more resources â for us that's hugely important because we are a voluntarily funded organization â but what's important is that there's an attention of the world on this issue of hunger â hunger caused by conflict or people's lack of earning power. Both of those problems are solvable," he said, hoping that the acknowledgment will "move the world closer to a world of zero hunger."But the goal sounds more like a dream in pandemic-wracked 2020. In 2019, the WFP assisted more than 97 million people â the largest number since 2012 â in 88 countries. According to a WFP projection, the number of hungry people could double from 135 million in 2019 to 265 million by the end of 2020. The Global Report on Food Crisis published in April puts the figure for people facing chronic food insecurity at an astonishing 821 million.With fractured supply chains, restrictions on movement, and shrinking coffers of donor governments and financial institutions, the task of putting food in the plates of those who need it the most has become even more daunting."First of all, the impact on supply lines. When you had certain restrictions being put in place. Second, the ability of people to move. Our field and humanitarian workers are moving all over the world, and we are moving them around. So that created an issue. And those who we serve suddenly found themselves more stressed than usual because of the economic impact. Also, many casual workers found themselves out of work. We found that the numbers of people who needed assistance were increasing. All of these issues compounded as the WFP is a totally 100-percent voluntarily funded organization," Abdulla said.The WFP, one of world's largest humanitarian organizations tackling hunger and food insecurity, needs to raise $6.8 billion to avert the impacts of the coronavirus crisis. So far, the Nobel laureate body has only managed to bag $1.6 billion.Emphasizing that food security, peace and stability go hand in hand, Abdulla pointed out that 10 out of 13 food crises today are caused by conflict. "Longer-term developmental solutions are required. Solutions that would include helping smallholder farmers with their own agriculture, if there are people have lost their livelihood, then putting income generation or sort of livelihood schemes. So, it's a multi-faceted approach that requires more than just the World Food Programme. That's the one thing about the work we do, we need to that in partnership with many," he said.Talking about the food crisis in Yemen, Abdulla urged warring parties to allow unhindered access for humanitarian workers to get to the places they need to. "We have seen in certain parts of Yemen our inability to supply because we are unable to get the conditions that we need to be able to monitor and be absolutely sure that the right people were getting the food, or we just had no access at all. Neither our goods nor our people have been able get through. So, the only solution is constant dialogue. We never give up and we always continue to negotiate," he said.October 16 marks World Food Day, which is dedicated to addressing the problem of global hunger and malnutrition. According to the WFP, hunger isn't always a lack of food. "Climate change is something that we need to get to grips with for sure. There's also the aspect of food waste and food lost. What's really important to recognize is that there's food waste is often in developed countries and there's food loss is many countries where we serve. And that loss is when it's lost in fields before harvesting or lost in storage before harvesting," said Abdulla, adding "if we could manage the waste in developed countries and avoid the loss in developing countries, that combined food almost on its own would solve hunger."This year 107 organizations and 215 individuals were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, including the World Health Organization and 17-year-old celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg. But a "workable scheme" that began 59 years ago grabbed the Nobel glory."We have never lost sight of what we would really like to do and that is to go back to being an experiment that could actually say: 'The experiment is over, world hunger is solved. We don't need WFP.' If we get to that, then we can say it was a successful experiment. Now it remains a project in course, and as long as we are needed our staff will be out doing what they are needed to do," Abdulla concluded. The World Food Programme (WFP) was born out of an experiment in 1961.

And that loss is when it's lost in fields before harvesting or lost in storage before harvesting," said Abdulla, adding "if we could manage the waste in developed countries and avoid the loss in developing countries, that combined food almost on its own would solve hunger."This year 107 organizations and 215 individuals were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, including the World Health Organization and 17-year-old celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg. But a "workable scheme" that began 59 years ago grabbed the Nobel glory."We have never lost sight of what we would really like to do and that is to go back to being an experiment that could actually say: 'The experiment is over, world hunger is solved. We don't need WFP.' If we get to that, then we can say it was a successful experiment. Now it remains a project in course, and as long as we are needed our staff will be out doing what they are needed to do," Abdulla concluded. China and Equatorial Guinea will consolidate political mutual trust, deepen cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), and push bilateral ties to a new level, said Chinese President Xi Jinping, on Thursday, in an exchange of congratulatory messages with the President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China and African countries, including Equatorial Guinea, have worked together in solidarity and safeguarded people's lives and health, injecting new connotation into the friendship between China and Africa, Xi said.Obiang echoed that his country will keep working with China to uphold multilateralism, the consultation mechanism, and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.China and Equatorial Guinea will consolidate political mutual trust, deepen cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), and push bilateral ties to a new level, said Chinese President Xi Jinping, on Thursday, in an exchange of congratulatory messages with the President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China and African countries, including Equatorial Guinea, have worked together in solidarity and safeguarded people's lives and health, injecting new connotation into the friendship between China and Africa, Xi said.Obiang echoed that his country will keep working with China to uphold multilateralism, the consultation mechanism, and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled the Trump administration can end the 2020 census count before its current deadline. Door-to-door counting will end October 15th and completing the census online will end October 16th.Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the only justice to dissent. "The harms associated with an inaccurate census are avoidable and intolerable," she wrote.The 2020 census became a controversial political topic this election year. The Trump administration cut funding to the Census Bureau. It has attempted to exclude undocumented immigrants and tried repeatedly to end the count ahead of schedule. Earlier this month, a federal judge issued an order stating the census could continue counting through the end of October.The COVID-19 pandemic also brought unprecedented problems with this year's population count. Coupled with roadblocks from the U.S. government, experts fear the census will be inaccurate and impact communities that already struggle with insufficient resources and representation.The goal of the census is to essentially count how many people live in a community. It's done every 10 years, and the data from the count determines how many congressional seats each states get in the House of Representatives and how much federal funding communities receive for education, healthcare and other public services. By ending it early, the New York Times reports, White House officials could use that data to their advantage.Minority groups and poor and young people who move frequently are often left out of the census or undercounted because they can be difficult to reach. These groups tend to live in urban areas that are often represented by Democrats. Ending the census early could deepen an undercount and "dilute" Democratic political representation, according to the New York Times.Because of COVID-19, the Census Bureau had previously received extensions for completing the count and turning in results. The deadline for finishing was pushed from the end of July to the end of October.In its push to end the count early, the Trump administration argued the Bureau would need to stop counting immediately so it could make the legal deadline of December 31 for delivering results to the president. The Trump administration would have the data needed to control representation in Congress, no matter who wins the presidential election.With the Supreme Court ruling, experts are not only concerned with undercounting and the politicization of the census but also an increase in distrust toward the bureau. Some are questioning the quality of this yearâs results and whether they can be trusted. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized," the key pacifist article in the constitution reads.Nevertheless, at the end of last month, Japan's Defense Ministry requested a record 5.49 trillion yen (about $52.17 billion) budget for the fiscal year starting in April 2021, with the request rising 3.3 percent from the initial budget for the current fiscal year through March 2021.With the ministry eyeing allocations for enhancing capabilities in outer space, cyberspace as well as financing for land-based infrastructure and hardware, Japan's defense spending under new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is looking set to rise for the ninth straight year.Japan on Wednesday unveiled its newest 3,000-ton submarine named Taigei which was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. amid no signs of the nation reining in its ever-increasing and constitutionally questionable "defense" spending.The submarine was unveiled at a shipyard in western Japan and is slated to go into service as the 22nd vessel in the Maritime Self-Defense Force's (MSDF) submarine fleet in March 2022.Tokyo has been planning to boost the number of its subs from 16 to 22 under plans laid out in its National Defense Program Guidelines in 2010, and Taigei, which means "big whale" in Japanese, will be able to house 70 crew members.The vessel is 84 meters in length and 9.1 meters in width and comes with a price tag of around 76 billion yen (about $722.23 million) to build, the MSDF said, adding that the incorporation of lithium-ion batteries allow the vessel to remain under water for longer than previous models.According to the MSDF, Japan currently operates nine 2,750-ton Oyashio-class submarines and 11 2,950-ton Soryu-class warships.The MSDF is planning to introduce a 12th Soryu-class sub next year, it said.As for the new Taigei, it will be the first in the new Taigei-class category following the Oyashio and Soryu, the MSDF explained.Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi, MSDF Chief of Staff Hiroshi Yamamura and around 150 others attended a ceremony Wednesday held at a Japanese defense equipment maker's Kobe Shipyard in Hyogo Prefecture.Japan is still bound by the constraints of its pacifist constitution, Article 9 of which states that the "Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.""In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.

The foreign minister had initially intended to visit Turkey's capital, Ankara, during his trip but canceled his plans before setting off."Ankara must end the interplay between detente and provocation if the government is interested in talks â as it has repeatedly affirmed," Maas said before leaving for Cyprus and Greece.The research ship Oruc Reis' presence "goes against what we (EU countries) agreed on, namely to try all diplomatic means to calm the intensity of tensions in a climate of trust," Maas said after visiting Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis."We've all been very surprised by what we've seen from the Turkish side in recent days," he said.Turkey on Monday raised tensions with its neighbors after it said it would redeploy the exploration vessel, Oruc Reis, to the eastern Mediterranean region off the coast of Greek islands.

But Mitsotakis stressed that his country would not engage in talks with the Oruc Reis on the Greek continental shelf.Maas arrived in Athens after talks with the Cypriot government a few hours earlier in the Cypriot capital Nicosia, where he said Turkey should make sure that "the window of dialogue that has just opened with Greece doesn't close because of unilateral measures."Athens and Nicosia are at odds with Ankara for years over maritime borders and the right to exploit energy resources. The dispute is expected on the agenda when EU leaders meet at a Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday."If Ankara continues its illegal actions, we will use all the instruments at our disposal" to respond, European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen has said.Meanwhile, Greece's Prime Minister Mitsotakis has stressed that before Ankara's announcement to deploy the research vessel, the two sides had agreed, under German mediation, to restart exploratory contact from where they had stopped in 2016 to reach an agreement on the delimitation of maritime zones. However, as long as the Turkish research vessel Oruc Reis is sailing in the East Med within the Greek exclusive economic zone (EEZ), there can be no dialogue, the Greek leader said.In a strongly worded statement, the U.S. State Department said it "deplores" Turkey's decision and noted that Greece "asserts jurisdiction" over areas where the Turkish ship plans to operate through October 22."We urge Turkey to end this calculated provocation and immediately begin exploratory talks with Greece," said Morgan Ortagus, spokeswoman of the State Department.

Over the past four decades, Shenzhen has been transformed from a small fishing village into a modern metropolis with a permanent population of over 13 million. "The world economy is currently facing complicated challenges. By no means should we be stopped by the reversing trends and tides. We should choose the right side of the history to unswervingly expand opening-up in an all-round way, and promote the building of an open world economy and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind," Chinese President Xi Jinping told the gathering. At a time when the global economic recovery has been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-globalization sentiment, China in May this year brought to the table a new development pattern. Known as "dual circulation," it takes the domestic market as the mainstay while letting domestic and foreign markets boost each other. "The new development pattern is not a closed domestic circulation, but an open domestic and international dual circulation," Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed in the speech. He pointed out the need to explore a more flexible policy system and a more scientific management system in domestic and international trade, investment and financing, fiscal and tax affairs, financial innovation and border entry and exit. Shenzhen, a miracle in world development Shenzhen is a brand-new city created by the CPC and the Chinese people since the country's reform and opening-up and its development over the past 40 years is a miracle in the world development history, Xi said. Read more:Shenzhen at 40: A snapshot of landmarks over the years One small step for Shenzhen, one giant leap for China From 1980 to 2019, Shenzhen's GDP rose from 270 million yuan to 2.7 trillion yuan ($40 million to $400 billion), with an average annual growth rate of 20.7 percent, according to Xi. Its fiscal revenue also increased from less than 100 million yuan to 942.4 billion yuan ($14.9 million to $139.8 billion) during the period. Its total imports and exports climbed from $18 million in 1980 to $431.5 billion in 2019, an average annual growth rate of 26.1 percent, contributing to an all-around opening up, Xi summarized. People's livelihoods have also greatly improved in Shenzhen, with tremendous advancements in education, medical care, housing and other areas. Its per capita disposable income skyrocketed to 62,500 yuan ($9,272) in 2019, a 31.6-fold growth compared to that of 1985.Valuable experience Xi stressed the valuable experience from the development miracles of the special economic zones (SEZs) including Shenzhen. Below is some of the advice offered by the president: -- adhere to the concept that development is of paramount importance, insist on the practices of daring to try and daring to be the first, and pursue reform breakthroughs through creative thoughts. -- remain committed to opening-up on all fronts and continuously enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going out." -- take innovation as the primary driving force and win the upper hand in global technological revolution and industrial transformation. -- follow the people-centered philosophy of development to allow the people to benefit more from the achievements of reform and development in a fairer way. -- ensure scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality and universal law-abiding to make rule of law an important guarantee for the development of the SEZs. -- carry out the philosophy of "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets" to achieve sustained development of economy and society as well as ecology and environment in a comprehensive and coordinated way. -- implement the fundamental principle of "One Country, Two Systems" in a comprehensive and accurate way, and promote the integrated development of the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao. -- give full play to the leading and exemplary role of the SEZs while making overall plans for the country, so that they can contribute more to national development. 'Engine' for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hailing Shenzhen as an "engine" for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s development, Xi asked Shenzhen to take active moves to further promote the construction of the area and called for efforts to synergize economic rules and mechanisms in the three regions. The GBA Initiative was first mentioned in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and aims to combine the three regions in order to turn it into one of the world's top bay areas and world-class city clusters. Read more: Why is the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area crucial? The area encompasses the special administrative regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macao, as well as cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen in southern China's Guangdong Province. Local governments need to build regional railroads, allowing talents and goods to flow between the area more efficiently, which will improve market integration, said Xi. The country will deepen the reform and opening-up of the Qianhai-Shenzhen-Hong Kong pilot cooperation zone and speed up the construction of a comprehensive national science center in the GBA to enhance coordination and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao. The GBA's platform should be fully utilized to attract more young talents from Hong Kong and Macao to come to the region to study, work and build a life, providing them with a deeper and wider level of communication and understanding of each other, the president continued. Xi welcomed greater participation of foreign countries in the reform, opening-up and development of China's special economic zones.  He said foreign participation has been indispensable in building the economic zones over the past 40 years, assisting in the creation of vast development opportunities and offering development benefits for foreign countries.Continuous reform and wider opening-up were key terms in President Xi's speech at the grand gathering, or as some experts pointed out, the southern Chinese city is the best example that shows the need for further opening-up.Read more:CGTN Opinion: Wider opening-up a key takeaway from Xi's speech"As China's first special economic zone and through the launch of a market-driven scheme that supported the attraction of a large number of foreign investments, the city has become instrumental in making China a prominent player in today's global economy," commented Matteo Giovannini, a Beijing-based finance professional. The city is home to various leading Chinese tech companies, including telecoms giant Huawei and technology conglomerate Tencent, two of the major companies that the U.S. has been putting pressure on in the most recently souring China-U.S. ties.

It insisted that Azeri forces were not violating the truce and accused Armenian forces of breaching the agreement by shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy, Aghdam and Terter. Armenia denied the accusation and said Azerbaijan had resumed military operations "supported by active artillery fire in the southern, northern, northeastern and eastern directions."Meantime, the death toll in the conflict continues to rise. Officials at the Nagorno-Karabakh region said 532 servicemen had been killed so far, seven since Monday. Azerbaijan has reported 42 Azeri civilian deaths and 206 others wounded since the fighting erupted on September 27.

The U.S. intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy," he said.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country, said the envoy."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he added."China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail," Geng added.The ambassador emphasized that China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process."Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," he noted.China has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, said the envoy."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council) country who has made such commitments," Geng noted."China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5," the ambassador stressed.The First Committee, also known as the Disarmament and International Security Committee, is one of six main committees of the UNGA. It deals with disarmament and international security matters.The committee meets every year in October for a 4-5 week session, after the UNGA General Debate. All 193 member states of the United Nations can attend.Statement of H. E. Mr. Geng Shuang, Head of the Chinese Delegation and Deputy Permanent Representative at the General Debate of the First Committee of the 75th Session of the UNGA(From Chinese Mission to the United Nations)2020/10/12Mr. Chairman,First of all, please allow me to extend, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, my congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as Chairman of the First Committee of the current session of the UN General Assembly. The Chinese delegation wishes to assure you and other delegations of its full support and cooperation to make this session of the committee a full success.Mr. Chairman,The global strategic security and arms control situation today is faced with the gravest challenge since the Cold War. To maintain its supremacy as the sole super power, the US has reverted to the Cold War mentality, hyped up major power competition and stoked major power confrontation. These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability.For the past years, to develop military capabilities without constraint, the US has continuously withdrawn from international treaties, sabotaging the multilateral and bilateral arms control and disarmament regime built up gradually after the WWII. The US is investing trillions of US dollars to modernize its nuclear Triad, developing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, and expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence. The US has also lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, and even discussed the resumption of nuclear tests. We urge the US to faithfully fulfill its special and primary responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, positively respond to Russia's appeal for the extension of the New START Treaty, and further substantially reduce its nuclear arsenal, so as to create conditions for other Nuclear Weapon States to join multilateral nuclear disarmament.The unrestrained development and deployment of a global missile defense system by the US as well as its attempts to deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, not only pose threats to China's security, but also undermine regional peace and security and disrupt global strategic stability. China is gravely concerned and urges the US to stop relevant deployments. Should the US continue to go down this path, China will take forceful countermeasures in defense of its own national interests when necessary.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. At present, the US has gone to extremes to shift responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, exercise double standards in violation of international law on non-proliferation issues, and manipulate the peaceful use of nuclear energy for political purposes, putting all the three pillars of the NPT under unprecedented strain. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of NPT, China calls on all parties to take this as an opportunity to reaffirm the treaty obligations and commitments made in the outcome documents of previous review conferences, and work for progress on the three pillars of NPT in a balanced manner. address the differences and disputes constructively, so as to achieve pragmatic outcomes at the 10th Review Conference.Recently the US named China as "the third largest nuclear power on earth", hyped up "nuclear arms race between the US, Russia and China" and proposed so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation". This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community. The US intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country. Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the US and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation. China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail.China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process. Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China has declared the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Non-Nuclear-Weapon States or Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones. China is the only P5 country who makes such commitments. China firmly abides by its commitments on the moratorium of nuclear tests, and supports the development of the verification mechanism of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). China supports negotiation for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of a comprehensive and balanced program of work in accordance with the mandate contained in the Shannon Report, and supports the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification. China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5.In the face of the increasingly complex and ominous international security landscape, the P5 should take proactive measures to manage differences, and work together to maintain global strategic stability. Since the Beijing Conference in January last year, the P5 have reached consensus on carrying out cooperation on strategic security issues including nuclear doctrines and policies, nuclear risk reduction, etc. China suggests that the P5 continue to strengthen dialogue on nuclear policies and doctrines, jointly reiterate that "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought", make a commitment not to target their nuclear weapons at any State, commit to the no-first-use of nuclear weapons unconditionally, and conclude legally binding international instruments on providing negative and positive security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States. We urge the US to abandon the policies of nuclear umbrella and nuclear sharing, withdraw all the nuclear weapons deployed overseas, stop the development and deployment of its global missile defense system, and play a due role in improving international and regional security environment.Mr. Chairman,The root cause of the current tensions related to the Iran nuclear issue is the US unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, re-imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran, and blocking other parties from fulfilling their obligations under the JCPOA. Having withdrawn from the JCPOA, the US has no right to trigger the Security Council snap-back mechanism, and its unilateral announcement on restoration of the UNSC sanctions against Iran has no legal validity whatsoever. It is imperative that all relevant parties resolve differences over the implementation of the JCPOA through dialogue and consultation within the framework of the Joint Commission focusing on restoring the balance of rights and obligations. China attaches high importance to the concerns of relevant parties over regional security issues, and advocates, on the premise of preserving the JCPOA, the establishment of an alternative multilateral dialogue platform with the purpose of building new consensus on maintaining peace and stability in the region.The US bears the responsibility for the deadlock of the DPRK-US dialogue regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. China urges the US to show sincerity and respond with concrete actions to the DPRK's legitimate concerns over security and development, so as to bring the Peninsular nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue. China is committed to upholding the denuclearization, peace and stability of the Peninsula, and to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation. China is firmly opposed to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction beyond the mandates of the UNSC resolutions and to any attempt by forces outside the region to use the Peninsula issue as an excuse to beef up military deployment in the region. China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.Mr. Chairman,The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has sounded the alarm on bio-security and highlighted the importance and urgency of strengthening global bio-security governance. In this connection, China wishes to make the following points. First, all parties should faithfully fulfill their due obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The international community is highly concerned with the US military's biological programs. We urge the US to act in an open, transparent and responsible manner and fully clarify its activities in numerous bio-labs overseas. Second, efforts should be made to resume negotiation for a verification protocol under BWC framework in order to put in place an effective international verification mechanism for the sake of safeguarding bio-security. We hope that such a decision can be made at next year's BWC Review Conference. We once again urge the US to stop impeding the resumption of negotiation. Third, it is necessary to set up a scientific advisory body within the framework of BWC and develop a voluntary code of conduct, in order to better regulate bio-research activities and promote the sound development of bio-technologies. Fourth, it is time to establish a fair and inclusive non-proliferation, export control and international cooperation regime under the framework of the BWC, remove discriminatory barriers, ensure developing countries' rights to the dividends of bio-technologies and jointly lift global bio-security to a new level.As the only possessor of chemical weapon stockpile, the US should earnestly fulfill its obligations under the CWC and expedite the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. In dealing with the Syrian chemical weapons issue, the provisions of CWC should be strictly observed and the authority of the Convention should be upheld. China strongly opposes political manipulation of the issue by a small number of countries for geopolitical purposes.Mr. Chairman,With the rapid development of digital economy, prominent risks associated with data security require global solutions. What is pressing now is to develop a set of international rules on data security that reflect the will and respect the interests of most countries on the basis of universal participation. China rejects attempts of the US and some other countries to politicize the issue of data security, elbow out countries with different views in the name of the so-called Clean Network program, and prey on enterprises of other countries under the pretext of security.China has recently put forward the Global Initiative on Data Security with a view to addressing data security risks and challenges, safeguarding global data and supply chain security, and promoting digital economic development and cooperation. China's initiative calls on all states to oppose using ICT activities to impair other States' critical infrastructure or steal important data, oppose abusing ICT to conduct mass surveillance against other States, desist from requesting domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in one's own territory, and ask ICT products and services providers not to install back-doors in their products and services. China's initiative aims to serve as a basis for international rules-making on data security, and is also a commitment of China to safeguarding global data security. China hopes that all parties could support this initiative, and we are open to good ideas and suggestions from all sides. China supports the work of the UN OEWG and UN GGE and hope that these processes will make further progress.The current security situation in outer space is increasingly challenging. In particular, the US has been pursuing a strategy for dominance in space, blatantly termed outer space as a new war-fighting domain, and has even established an independent Space Force and the Space Command. The US also plans to deploy missile defense system in outer space. These US moves accelerate the militarization and weaponization of outer space and therefore are the most prominent factors affecting outer space security. China urges the US to stop impeding international arms control process on outer space, and join international efforts for negotiation and conclusion of an international legal instrument based on the draft PPWT proposed by China and Russia, so as to fundamentally safeguard lasting peace and common security in outer space.The rapid development of the military application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may give rise to security, humanitarian, legal and ethical concerns. Paying high attention to these issues, China is supportive of having in-depth international discussions aimed at exploring effective measures to address the associated risks and ensuring that AI technology will benefit all mankind. China also supports continued in-depth discussions on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) within the framework of Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), with the purpose of negotiating a legally-binding international instrument.Mr. Chairman,China acceded to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) on 6 July this year. This is a significant step taken by China in its active efforts to promote global arms trade governance and to safeguard international and regional peace and security. This testifies to China's sincerity in upholding multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind. As a State Party to the ATT, China will faithfully fulfill its obligations, and work closely with all parties to promote the universality and effectiveness of the ATT. In this connection, China is ready to provide assistance to the developing countries within its capacity. China attaches great importance to African concerns about the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, and supports the African Union's initiative of "Silencing the Guns in Africa". To this end, China has provided USD 1.4 million through the United Nations Peace and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019. Standing ready to carry out further cooperation with the AU and African countries in this regard, China also calls upon the international community to provide needed assistance to Africa. Meanwhile, we urge all countries to stop arms sales to non-state actors, and refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign states through arms exports.Mr. Chairman,No matter how grave the international security situation may become, as long as we stay committed to upholding multilateralism, strengthening mutual trust and coordination centered on the UN, and building a community with a shared future for mankind, we would be able to make progress in international arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation. China is ready to join hands with other members of the international community to make unremitting efforts towards this end.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.A Chinese envoy said on Monday that asking China to participate in the "trilateral arms control negotiation" is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible.Geng Shuang, head of the Chinese delegation and deputy permanent representative of China to the United Nations, rejected the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" recently hyped up by the United States, in his statement delivered at the general debate of the First Committee of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).Geng pointed out that recently the United States named China as "the third largest nuclear power on Earth," hyped up "nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia and China" and proposed the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation.""This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community. The U.S. intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy," he said.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country, said the envoy."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he added."China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail," Geng added.The ambassador emphasized that China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process."Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," he noted.China has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, said the envoy."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council) country who has made such commitments," Geng noted."China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5," the ambassador stressed.The First Committee, also known as the Disarmament and International Security Committee, is one of six main committees of the UNGA. It deals with disarmament and international security matters.The committee meets every year in October for a 4-5 week session, after the UNGA General Debate. All 193 member states of the United Nations can attend.Statement of H. E. Mr. Geng Shuang, Head of the Chinese Delegation and Deputy Permanent Representative at the General Debate of the First Committee of the 75th Session of the UNGA(From Chinese Mission to the United Nations)2020/10/12Mr. Chairman,First of all, please allow me to extend, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, my congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as Chairman of the First Committee of the current session of the UN General Assembly. The Chinese delegation wishes to assure you and other delegations of its full support and cooperation to make this session of the committee a full success.Mr. Chairman,The global strategic security and arms control situation today is faced with the gravest challenge since the Cold War. To maintain its supremacy as the sole super power, the US has reverted to the Cold War mentality, hyped up major power competition and stoked major power confrontation. These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability.For the past years, to develop military capabilities without constraint, the US has continuously withdrawn from international treaties, sabotaging the multilateral and bilateral arms control and disarmament regime built up gradually after the WWII. The US is investing trillions of US dollars to modernize its nuclear Triad, developing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, and expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence. The US has also lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, and even discussed the resumption of nuclear tests. We urge the US to faithfully fulfill its special and primary responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, positively respond to Russia's appeal for the extension of the New START Treaty, and further substantially reduce its nuclear arsenal, so as to create conditions for other Nuclear Weapon States to join multilateral nuclear disarmament.The unrestrained development and deployment of a global missile defense system by the US as well as its attempts to deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, not only pose threats to China's security, but also undermine regional peace and security and disrupt global strategic stability. China is gravely concerned and urges the US to stop relevant deployments. Should the US continue to go down this path, China will take forceful countermeasures in defense of its own national interests when necessary.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. At present, the US has gone to extremes to shift responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, exercise double standards in violation of international law on non-proliferation issues, and manipulate the peaceful use of nuclear energy for political purposes, putting all the three pillars of the NPT under unprecedented strain. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of NPT, China calls on all parties to take this as an opportunity to reaffirm the treaty obligations and commitments made in the outcome documents of previous review conferences, and work for progress on the three pillars of NPT in a balanced manner. address the differences and disputes constructively, so as to achieve pragmatic outcomes at the 10th Review Conference.Recently the US named China as "the third largest nuclear power on earth", hyped up "nuclear arms race between the US, Russia and China" and proposed so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation". This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community. The US intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country. Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the US and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation. China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail.China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process. Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China has declared the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Non-Nuclear-Weapon States or Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones. China is the only P5 country who makes such commitments. China firmly abides by its commitments on the moratorium of nuclear tests, and supports the development of the verification mechanism of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). China supports negotiation for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of a comprehensive and balanced program of work in accordance with the mandate contained in the Shannon Report, and supports the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification. China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5.In the face of the increasingly complex and ominous international security landscape, the P5 should take proactive measures to manage differences, and work together to maintain global strategic stability. Since the Beijing Conference in January last year, the P5 have reached consensus on carrying out cooperation on strategic security issues including nuclear doctrines and policies, nuclear risk reduction, etc. China suggests that the P5 continue to strengthen dialogue on nuclear policies and doctrines, jointly reiterate that "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought", make a commitment not to target their nuclear weapons at any State, commit to the no-first-use of nuclear weapons unconditionally, and conclude legally binding international instruments on providing negative and positive security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States. We urge the US to abandon the policies of nuclear umbrella and nuclear sharing, withdraw all the nuclear weapons deployed overseas, stop the development and deployment of its global missile defense system, and play a due role in improving international and regional security environment.Mr. Chairman,The root cause of the current tensions related to the Iran nuclear issue is the US unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, re-imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran, and blocking other parties from fulfilling their obligations under the JCPOA. Having withdrawn from the JCPOA, the US has no right to trigger the Security Council snap-back mechanism, and its unilateral announcement on restoration of the UNSC sanctions against Iran has no legal validity whatsoever. It is imperative that all relevant parties resolve differences over the implementation of the JCPOA through dialogue and consultation within the framework of the Joint Commission focusing on restoring the balance of rights and obligations. China attaches high importance to the concerns of relevant parties over regional security issues, and advocates, on the premise of preserving the JCPOA, the establishment of an alternative multilateral dialogue platform with the purpose of building new consensus on maintaining peace and stability in the region.The US bears the responsibility for the deadlock of the DPRK-US dialogue regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. China urges the US to show sincerity and respond with concrete actions to the DPRK's legitimate concerns over security and development, so as to bring the Peninsular nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue. China is committed to upholding the denuclearization, peace and stability of the Peninsula, and to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation. China is firmly opposed to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction beyond the mandates of the UNSC resolutions and to any attempt by forces outside the region to use the Peninsula issue as an excuse to beef up military deployment in the region. China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.Mr. Chairman,The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has sounded the alarm on bio-security and highlighted the importance and urgency of strengthening global bio-security governance. In this connection, China wishes to make the following points. First, all parties should faithfully fulfill their due obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The international community is highly concerned with the US military's biological programs. We urge the US to act in an open, transparent and responsible manner and fully clarify its activities in numerous bio-labs overseas. Second, efforts should be made to resume negotiation for a verification protocol under BWC framework in order to put in place an effective international verification mechanism for the sake of safeguarding bio-security. We hope that such a decision can be made at next year's BWC Review Conference. We once again urge the US to stop impeding the resumption of negotiation. Third, it is necessary to set up a scientific advisory body within the framework of BWC and develop a voluntary code of conduct, in order to better regulate bio-research activities and promote the sound development of bio-technologies. Fourth, it is time to establish a fair and inclusive non-proliferation, export control and international cooperation regime under the framework of the BWC, remove discriminatory barriers, ensure developing countries' rights to the dividends of bio-technologies and jointly lift global bio-security to a new level.As the only possessor of chemical weapon stockpile, the US should earnestly fulfill its obligations under the CWC and expedite the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile.

"For instance, Smederevo steel mill is one of the examples of joint victory."In 2016, Serbia's only steel mill was saved from bankruptcy by the Chinese HBIS group. Thanks to that intervention, over 12,000 workers kept their jobs.However, amid uncertain progress in EU membership talks, Serbia is also courting the U.S. as it seeks international allies, placing it in the middle of tense relations between east and west.  Vucic recently visited Washington to sign an agreement with the U.S. vowing not to use 5G equipment from "suspicious sources." This came just weeks after the U.S. banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, claiming it could compromise national security.Vucic said: "We already had various pressures and we know it is not easy to maintain a friendship with China. But so far, Serbia [has been] successful in maintaining it. We'll keep our freedom of choices, and we'll continue to build a sincere friendship with the People's Republic of China."    Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi hailed Serbia as a "true and great friend" after meeting President Aleksandar Vucic and his leading ministers.Yang Jiechi also praised Serbia's economic development and said China would continue to encourage its companies to invest in Serbia and help to maintain its economic growth. The two nations have established an increasingly close relationship, with Serbia receiving large shipments of medical aid from China to help its fight against COVID-19.Now, Yang Jiechi says the focus of the two nations is to map out their future economic relationship, which he believes will benefit both parties.  "Regarding practical cooperation between China and Serbia, it is proven to be mutually beneficial," he said.

"China's reform and opening-up, as well as its development and construction, are inseparable from the large number of overseas Chinese who care about their motherland," he said.The old downtown area of Shantou witnessed the city's opening-up. Xi visited the Shantou Opening Port Culture Exhibition Hall, where he learned about Shantou's history since it opened a wharf in the 19th century, and the Qiaopi Museum in Kaibu District, which houses many "qiaopi" or letters from overseas Chinese to their families in China. The Qiaopi Museum has so far collected some 30,000 original copies and 30,000 photocopies of the letters. Xi spoke highly of the role that overseas Chinese have played in China's reform and opening-up.The group of people "with a Chinese heart" love their country and hometown deeply, and they made a huge contribution to China's opening-up and economic growth, Xi said.Read more:'Reform and opening-up' remains theme of Xi Jinping's visit to China's Guangdong Province Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that he came to Guangdong to send a clear message that the Communist Party of China (CPC) will continue to lead China on the path of reform and opening-up.Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks to a crowd of local people in the old downtown area in Shantou City, south China's Guangdong Province. Growing from a 1.6-square-kilometer suburban area into a modern coastal city, the Shantou Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in southern China's Guangdong Province is a paragon of the country's development through reform and opening-up over the past 40 years. The Shantou SEZ, founded in 1980, now covers 2,064 square kilometers on the eastern coast of Guangdong. "I'm here in Guangdong to show both China and the world that the Communist Party of China will firmly continue to lead the Chinese people to walk down the road of reform and opening-up," Xi told the crowd.The CPC will strive for the prosperity of the country and the well-being of the Chinese people and endeavor to realize the national rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, he said.The Chinese president also affirmed the contribution of overseas Chinese to the country.

They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other's positions," said the statement.According to the statement, the two sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels in order to find a "mutually acceptable solution" for the lasting standoff."Both sides agreed to earnestly implement the important understandings reached by the leaders of the two countries, not to turn differences into disputes, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas," said the statement.The meeting, began on Monday, is the seventh round of commander-level talks between the two sides. During the sixth round of military talks, military officials of the two sides agreed to stop sending more troops in the border areas.Tensions between the two sides rose in April, as the Chinese Defense Ministry claimed that the Indian border troops have unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities in the Galwan Valley on the Chinese side, blocked the Chinese troops' patrol in an attempt to unilaterally change the status of the border control. It soon escalated after the two sides clashed on June 15, causing a total of 20 Indian deaths.Read more:Chinese Defense Ministry blames India for border clash: it 'unilaterally' violates consensusChina opposes India building bridges, warns of further tension in border areasChina and India reached a five-point consensus regarding the current situation in early September of which the two countries agreed to ease tension and not allowing differences to become disputes.India's consistent enhancement of its infrastructures and deployment of forces in the area is recognized as the leading cause of the tension, as Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday after India announced it had opened 44 bridges in the border areas."We urged the Indian side to fully implement the consensuses reached by the two sides, stop taking any actions that may worsen the situation and maintain peace and stability in the region with concrete efforts," said Zhao in a daily briefing.China and India held "positive, constructive" discussions on disengaging troops locked in a months-long standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Western Sector of China-India border areas, said the Chinese Defense Ministry in a statement on Tuesday."The two sides had a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the Western Sector of China-India border areas.

However, some high-profile cases involving violent crimes committed by underage youths in recent years have sparked a heated debate on the minimum age of criminal liability.Besides, statistics from the country's top procuratorate raised concerns over juvenile crimes.

It's one of few key states in the age of mass mail-in voting likely to report on November 3, and if Biden wins its 29 Electoral College votes, the election will be as good as over.CGTN analysis of public polling indicates the former vice president is up by 3.4 points in Florida and over eight points nationally, with female, older and suburban voters moving towards him. Biden has built up a lead with seniors, the most reliable voting bloc, as the pandemic has progressed.While the first presidential debate looks to have hurt Trump in the polls, the only lasting impact from the vice-presidential clash between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Mike Pence is the slew of memes that emerged after a fly perched for two minutes on the vice president's head.Snap polls suggested Harris was the winner of a low-key debate which was quickly forgotten as the president returned to center stage. Whether Biden and Trump will square up again in person remains unclear â the president has refused to debate virtually and so the second event, scheduled for this week, has been cancelled.The third planned debate, now the second, is still due to go ahead on October 22 and could be the final opportunity for Trump to try to knock the risk-averse Biden campaign off course.Video: Wang Zengzheng and Zhou TingyuScript: John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.With three weeks until election day in the United States more than 10 million Americans have already voted and CGTN analysis suggests Joe Biden has pulled further ahead of Donald Trump in the national polls.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionHere are the highlights from the past seven days.Trump returned to the White House after his COVID-19 hospitalization, released a series of videos, conducted phone or recorded interviews with Fox News, addressed a crowd on the South Lawn on Saturday, and then got into a spat with Anthony Fauci before returning to the campaign trail in Florida on Monday.The president, desperate to return to in-person events, insisted he was "immune" from the virus on Sunday in a tweet which was flagged for spreading "misleading and potentially harmful information" as the U.S. continued to report over 40,000 new COVID-19 cases per day.Confirmation of a negative test did not come until Trump was en route to Monday's rally, the first of a series of swing state campaign stops â Axios reported that the Republican wants to hold a rally every day until November 3.Polling numbers for Trump have gone from bad to worse since the first presidential debate and his COVID-19 diagnosis.Seemingly low on funds, the president's campaign is cutting advertising spending and hoping for a free media boost from rallies just as Biden, flush with cash, broadens his own ad buys: the Democrat splashed out $40 million to Trump's $23 million over the past week.Florida is yet again shaping up to be the race to watch.

negotiation" with the U.S. and Russia as the U.S. intends to avoid its own responsibility in nuclear disarmament.  The U.S. named China "the third largest nuclear power on Earth," hyped up the "nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia and China" and proposed the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation," which is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community, said Geng, the head of the Chinese delegation and deputy permanent representative of China to the United Nations.Speaking during the general debate of the First Committee of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), Geng called the trilateral arms control talks "coercion" and "blackmail," saying China will never be part of such negotiation. China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in a nuclear arms race with any other country, Geng said."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he continued.But the Chinese representative said China is pursuing its responsibility to push forward nuclear disarmament.China signed the UN-led Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) spurned by the U.S. in July, Geng noted, saying it's a "significant" step taken by his country.The ATT regulates a 70 billion-U.S.-dollar global cross-border trade in conventional arms and seeks to keep weapons out of the hands of human rights abusers.Then-U.S. President Barack Obama's administration signed it, but it was opposed by the National Rifle Association and never ratified by the U.S. Senate.In July 2019, the United States told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that Washington did not intend to become a party to the treaty and that it had no legal obligations from its 2013 signature.Naming the United States, Geng said the U.S. is reverted to the Cold War mentality and launched acts of unilateralism and confrontation."These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability."Geng noted that China has provided $1.4 million through the United Nations Peace and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019 to help reduce illicit trafficking of small weapons in African countries.China also has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, Geng said."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council)

Many Republicans have followed the lead of President Donald Trump, who has regularly castigated voting by mail, while the party's leadership in some states has offered mixed messages about when supporters should vote.While millions of people are choosing to vote by mail this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, others are opting for in-person early voting.Recent controversies including criticism by the Trump administration over the U.S. Postal Service and doubts about the acceptance of ballots are leading some to head to the polls in-person. In Virginia, early voting began September 28th. Officials say election workers are receiving about 2,000 mail-in ballots per day and hundreds are lining up to vote in-person. More than 890,000 people have already cast ballots by voting in person, by mail or drop box."We're probably looking at three times the rate for early voting that we saw in 2016," said Gary D.

The LA Times reports, fear was a common factor among reasons why people decided to vote early. Voters were worried their mail-in ballots wouldnât arrive on time, get lost or election officials would stop counting.In Georgia, early in-person voting began Monday. Thousands of people turned out in long lines. Voters in Fulton County faced technical glitches that temporarily stopped voting but officials were able to clear the lines by mid-morning.CNN reports the state of Ohio has received almost 2.2 million ballot requests... double those from early October 2016.Considering millions have already cast their votes early, experts predict a record turnout for the election. National opinion polls show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the lead over Trump. But as officials brace for an influx of mail-in ballots compared to previous elections, they are also warning, Americans might not have a final result by the end of the night on November 3rd. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

Pubs and bars will close temporarily and socializing prohibited indoors, but universities and retail shops will stay open.High level measures will be applied to Manchester and Nottinghamshire, meaning socializing indoors will be banned and the rule of six applied in outdoor settings, but pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open, as across the rest of the country, until 10 p.m.  Those areas placed on the medium tier will continue to follow national guidelines, with bars and pubs closing at 10 p.m. and the rule of six applied outdoors.The UK government response is for England only, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland implementing their own strategies to deal with the pandemic.Johnson says the new system is designed to avoid another national lockdown, which he says would cause long-term economic damage."This is not how we want to live our lives," he said. "But it is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic costs of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."  Johnson added: "The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country. I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed."The prime minister and his scientific advisers will continue to monitor the number of cases in each area, which could lead to an increasing number of towns and cities facing the most severe measures.England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained why cases of COVID-19 have risen so sharply the north of England compared with the rest of the country. "The epidemic this time has clearly picked up pace in the north of England earlier than it did in the first wave and that almost certainly relates to the fact that disease levels in the north never dropped, and certainly in the northwest, they never dropped as far as they dropped in the summer as they did in the south."Johnson also announced a further economic package would be introduced to replace the furlough scheme, which comes to an end at the end of this month. The support will cover two-thirds of the wages for employees of businesses forced to close as a result of the new virus restrictions.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a new three-level COVID-19 alert system across England as cases continue to rise across the country.Infection rates have quadrupled in England in the past month, and hospital admissions have doubled. The new system will apply localized measures of varying severity to the worst-hit areas of the country, with regions placed into one of three levels â medium, high or very high. Liverpool has been placed in the very high level with measures set to be imposed from Wednesday.

establishing a republic following the abrupt departure abroad of former King Juan Carlos amid a cloud of scandal, according to an opinion poll.The 82-year-old former monarch has been living in the United Arab Emirates since he left Spain in August to avoid causing further embarrassment to his son, King Felipe VI.Of the respondents, 40.9 percent said they preferred a republic, while 34.9 percent said they supported the royal family and 24.2 percent said they did not know, according to the survey for the Platform for Independent Media, a group of mainly left-wing media.The poll, which questioned 3,000 people, also found 48 percent want a referendum on the monarchy, which under Spain's constitution is the only way to decide the fate of the institution, while 25 percent were opposed and 16.1 percent did not know.  A poll published in August for the pro-monarchy ABC newspaper found 33.5 percent favouring a republic and 56 percent the monarchy, while six percent did not know and 4.1 percent were indifferent.While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos could become a target in two inquiries in Spain and Switzerland into alleged corruption associated with a $9.9 billion, high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms.Spain's supreme court prosecutor is considering whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to formally involve Juan

holiday when King Felipe will lead a reduced celebration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was commissioned after the government's Centre for Sociological Investigations declined to question Spaniards about the monarchy in its most recent poll.Defence Minister Margarita Robles said the monarchy was an "essential part of the constitutional pact," speaking in an interview published on Monday in

establishing a republic following the abrupt departure abroad of former King Juan Carlos amid a cloud of scandal, according to an opinion poll.The 82-year-old former monarch has been living in the United Arab Emirates since he left Spain in August to avoid causing further embarrassment to his son, King Felipe VI.Of the respondents, 40.9 percent said they preferred a republic, while 34.9 percent said they supported the royal family and 24.2 percent said they did not know, according to the survey for the Platform for Independent Media, a group of mainly left-wing media.The poll, which questioned 3,000 people, also found 48 percent want a referendum on the monarchy, which under Spain's constitution is the only way to decide the fate of the institution, while 25 percent were opposed and 16.1 percent did not know.  A poll published in August for the pro-monarchy ABC newspaper found 33.5 percent favouring a republic and 56 percent the monarchy, while six percent did not know and 4.1 percent were indifferent.While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos could become a target in two inquiries in Spain and Switzerland into alleged corruption associated with a $9.9 billion, high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms.Spain's supreme court prosecutor is considering whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to formally involve Juan Carlos.The former king has not commented publicly but his lawyer Javier Sanchez has said he is at the disposition of prosecutors if necessary.  The latest survey, published on the National Day public

2,800 injured and disabled veterans. Some 2,200 of them participated in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.(With input from Xinhua)Chinese President Xi Jinping has called on the entire Party (the Communist Party of China) and society to respect heroes, learn from and care for them, so as to gather the mighty strength for the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.Xi made the remarks in a reply letter to all members of a sanatorium for injured and disabled revolutionary military veterans in southwest China's Sichuan Province, as China observes the 70th anniversary of the Chinese People's Volunteer (CPV) army entering the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.Appreciating the veterans for their devotion in defending the country and their firm belief in the Party over the past six decades, Xi said the CPV, carrying forward the great spirit of patriotism and revolutionary heroism, had marched forward gallantly, fought dauntlessly, and made vital contributions to safeguarding the motherland.The Party and the Chinese people will never forget their great contribution, Xi said.The Chinese nation has seen many heroes in history, and will continue to see more heroes in the new era, Xi stressed, calling on the whole society to learn CPV soldiers' heroic deeds.The sanatorium, built-in 1951, has served a total of over 2,800 injured and disabled veterans.

Reuters reported on Wednesday, though the Chinese mainland has repeatedly warned the U.S. to stop the deal.Citing Pentagon, Reuters said the U.S. State Department had approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan authorities, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion.Last week, the White House said they were moving forward with five separate sales of sophisticated military equipment to the island with a total value of around $5 billion.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin Corp, called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing Co, for an estimated $1 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow Wednesday's, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defense cruise missiles.Sources have said the 100 cruise missiles stations and 400 missiles would have a cost of about $2 billion.The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales, but Reuters said this is unlikely given broad bipartisan support for Taiwan.China has repeatedly warned the U.S. not to move forward the arms sales as the two countries' relations are under strain since the COVID-19 pandemic.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said last week that U.S. arms sales to China's Taiwan region severely damaged China's sovereignty and security interests.The United States is seriously violating the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, especially the August 17 communique, by selling arms to Taiwan, thereby seriously interfering in China's internal affairs, Zhao said in a daily briefing on October 13.He urged Washington to cancel the planned sales and warned that China would make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops.The U.S. State Department has formally notified the Congress of the planned

on Wednesday the State Department was designating six more China-based media companies in the U.S. as foreign missions, despite China's opposition.Previously in June, the U.S. had announced to treat four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies.Following the move, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had criticized Washington's actions, calling them further proof of the U.S.'s political oppression of the Chinese media."We strongly urge the U.S. to discard the Cold War mentality and ideological bias, and immediately stop and correct these damaging and harmful actions," MOFA spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said."The US has gone too far," Editor-in-Chief of Global Times Hu Xijin tweeted following the announcement.

The officer went astray as he responded to a request from herders to help them search for yaks late Sunday.It started at the 38th parallel north.On June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).Within two days, the U.S. government ordered troops to invade the DPRK and sent its Seventh Fleet into China's Taiwan Straits.On July 7, the United States manipulated the United Nations (UN) Security Council to adopt a resolution on dispatching a UN force that it led to the Korean Peninsula. The United States mobilized a third of its army, half of its navy and a fifth of its air force to join the war. Its peak troop strength topped 300,000.On September 15, the U.S. forces conducted the Incheon Landing, forcing the DPRK forces to retreat. Meanwhile, U.S. military planes intruded into China's airspace, bombing airports and infrastructure along its border with the DPRK.Do not step across the 38th parallel, China repeatedly cautioned. But the United States ignored the warning. Its army poured across the line on October 7 and pressed on towards the Sino-Korean border.The next day, at a time when China's national security was threatened and upon receiving then DPRK leader Kim Il Sung's urgent request for aid, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) was formed.On October 19, the CPV crossed the Yalu River to fight together with the DPRK army.It could have been a one-sided war. In 1950, China's industrial and agricultural output was 1/12 of the U.S. total, while its steel output 1/144 of the U.S. total.During the war, the U.S. military used all the latest weapons (other than nuclear), while the CPV mainly relied on infantry and limited artillery. The two sides were heavily mismatched in weapons, equipment, logistics and food supplies. But what happened next was beyond expectation.On October 25, the CPV launched the first battle, driving back the enemy forces to the Chongchon River.On November 7, the second battle started, ending with the U.S.-led army retreating to the south of the 38th parallel.Up to June 1951, the CPV launched five major battles in seven months that inflicted heavy losses on the UN force led by the United States, and essentially fixed the front around the 38th parallel.On July 10, 1951, the first truce talks began at Kaesong, near the 38th parallel.For the next two years, the Korean War continued as a stalemate â both negotiations and combat went on.On October 14, 1952, the Battle of Triangle Hill began. It was a hill covering 3.7 square kilometers.The United States had planned to seize the area with two battalions in five days at the expense of 200 casualties â but it ultimately cost 60,000 troops, 43 days and 25,000 casualties before the battle ended.Over 11,000 CPV soldiers were wounded or killed in the battle.On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in the village of Panmunjom, ending the 33-month War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.According to China's official release, more than 1.093 million enemy combatants were killed, wounded or captured. In the United States, the Korean War has been called "the Forgotten War."To protect their motherland, a total of 2.9 million CPV soldiers entered the battlefield and 197,653 sacrificed their lives, according to the latest data. For China, history will never be forgotten, and the heroes will be remembered.Managing editor: Hu YiweiVideo editor: Yu QianhuiAnimation &amp; graphics: Xu Qianyun, Chen Yuyang, Yin YatingVoiceover: Zeng ZiyiCopy editor: John GoodrichChief editor: Wang DeweiProducer: Dang ZhengManaging director: Mei YanSeventy years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) crossed the Yalu River and fought alongside the army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) against the Republic of Korea (ROK) and U.S.-led UN forces.A total of 2.9 million CPV soldiers entered the battlefield, 197,653 of whom sacrificed their lives in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953 Korean War).As 2020 marks the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, here are five facts you may not know about the conflict:1. China, U.S. never officially declared warNeither China nor the United States officially engaged in the conflict as nation states: China sent aâvolunteerâ force and the U.S. dominated and led UN forces. On June 27, 1950, two days after the war in Korean Peninsula broke out, U.S. President Harry Truman ordered navy and air force to intervene and the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait. Three days later he approved the use of ground forces on the Korean Peninsula.The U.S. Constitution states that Congress should decide when and where the country should go to a war. However, Truman's order was made without congressional approval, and war was never officially declared.Truman later argued a United Nations resolution gave him authority, but he ordered armed forces to the peninsula before the UN acted and before an agreement with the UN was reached.China sent forces under the banner of "volunteers" following a request for help from the DPRK and to protect China's national sovereignty, security and interests.Chairman Mao Zedong on October 8, 1950 issued an order saying, "In order to assist the Korean people's war of liberation against the attacks of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, thereby safeguarding the interests of the people of Korea, China and the other countries in the East, I hereby order to change the Northeastern Border Defense Army into the CPV."On October 19, 1950, as requested by the DPRK, CPV forces crossed the Yalu River to aid the DPRK's fight.The CPV launched its first battle on October 25 against a battalion of Syngman Rhee's troops. In 1951, the CPC Central Committee decided to commemorate the war annually on that date.2. Misperception between China and the U.SThe Chinese government repeatedly cautioned that if U.S. forces crossed the 38th parallel China would not sit idle, but the U.S. disregarded the warning, seeing it as only diplomatic parlance.After the U.S.-led UN forces landed at Inchon, 160 kilometers south of the 38th parallel, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai publicly warned on September 30, 1950 that, "The Chinese people enthusiastically love peace, but in order to defend peace they never have been and never will be afraid to oppose aggressive war.""The Chinese people absolutely will not tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they supinely tolerate seeing their neighbors being savagely invaded by imperialists," he added.On October 1, 1950, DPRK leader Kim Il Sung sent a telegram to Mao reporting the grim picture on the battlefield and requesting military aid from China.Since diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. had not been established, Indian Ambassador Kavalam Madhava Panikkar acted as a communication channel between the two camps.On October 2, Zhou formally notified Panikkar that if the U.S. crossed the 38th parallel, China would act. In Washington, Secretary of State Dean Acheson dismissed the warning as the "mere vaporings of a panicky Panikkar."In a document titled "Two Strategic Intelligence Mistakes in Korea, 1950," the CIA admitted U.S. intelligence erred: it believed that China, with limited military and economic capability, would not follow through on its warnings.U.S. forces crossed the 38th Parallel on October 7, and the CPV launched its first battle on October 25.3. Soviet Union sent air supportDeclassified documents from Russia show the Soviet Union was closely involved in the Korean War.In addition to diplomatic and logistical support, the Soviet Union sent air forces to the war from early November 1950. In order to avoid the appearance of direct military clashes with the U.S., Soviet pilots wore CPV uniforms and their aircraft carried CPV or DPRK markings.Records from the Soviet 64th Fighter Aviation Corps claim that from November 1950 till July 1953, the Soviets shot down 1,309 U.S. planes.The Soviet Union provided the CPV with enormous supplies of weapons, equipment and ammunition. China's military debt to the Soviet Union reached 3 billion yuan during the war.4. Japan was a major beneficiary Japan, which didn't send troops to the battlefield, was a major economic beneficiary during the Korean War. U.S. troops were stationed in Japan, so military goods were often purchased from Japanese companies. These companies received more than $3.5 billion over the three years of the conflict. Japan's production increased by nearly 70 percent and military procurement peaked at a level equivalent to seven percent of Japan's gross national product in 1953. By the time the three-year war ended in a truce, Japan's gross domestic product had returned to pre-World War II levels.  5. A never-ending war The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, but a peace treaty is yet to be inked. So although hostilities ceased in 1953, the war has not formally ended. "We cannot commemorate the Korean War in a genuine manner yet. That is because the war has yet to come to an end," ROK President Moon Jae-in said in June when attending a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader, Kim Jong Un, paid tribute to Chinese People's Volunteers(CPV) martyrs in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the CPV army entering the DPRK during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, local media reported.The Korean Central News Agency(KCNA) reported on Thursday that Kim, together with DPRK officials, visited CPV's martyrs tower at the cemetery for martyrs of the CPV in South Pyongan Province. A flower basket was presented in Kim's name.Kim Jong Un said that although it has been 70 years since the war, the people of DPRK still remember the heroic achievements of the CPV in resisting U.S. aggression and selflessly supporting the DPRK under extremely difficult circumstances.He said that the country will never forget the CPV soldiers' noble spirit of selflessness as they risked their lives and made sacrifices to conquer invasion of the forces of imperialism.No matter how much time passes and generations change, the significance of the great victory achieved by the two countries in the war created a link between the military and the people that remains unchanged, the DPRK leader said.According to the KCNA, Kim also visited the Friendship Tower in Pyongyang on Wednesday, presenting a flower basket at the tower.The Friendship Tower was built on October 25, 1959 to commemorate the CPV sacrifice in the war.(Cover: The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Un pays tribute to martyrs of Chinese People's Volunteers(CPV) commemorating the 70th anniversary of the CPV army entering the DPRK in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. /CCTV)There are two weeks to go until election day in the United States, 30 million Americans have already voted and Donald Trump and Joe Biden have spent the past seven days on the campaign trail in the critical swing states that will decide who wins the race for the White House.Election 2020: How is a U.S. president elected?Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionHere's what you might have missed over the past week.Biden has a stable polling advantage over Trump, more than eight points nationally according to CGTN analysis and by slightly smaller margins in the battlegrounds, but while the Democrat's lead has been steady for weeks, his campaign is warning against complacency."The very searing truth is that Donald Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire," Biden's campaign manager cautioned in a memo to supporters on Saturday.Trump has intensified his schedule, addressing rallies across the country â including Nevada, which he only narrowly lost in 2016 â with mainly mask-less crowds sitting shoulder to shoulder even as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are on the rise in 48 of the 50 states and polls suggest a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the pandemic. The president encouraged "lock her up" chants towards Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer â the subject of a recent kidnapping plot â again insulted infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and engaged in Twitter spats with fellow Republicans up for reelection including Senator Ben Sasse, who in a call to his Nebraska constituents warned of a "Republican bloodbath in the Senate."There are doubts over whether rallies to existing supporters are the best use of resources for a campaign that is running far behind in fundraising: in September Biden and his affiliates raked in $383 million, a huge $135 million more than Trump's $248 million.Whereas Trump's rallies led to free media worth tens of millions of dollars in 2016, in this cycle â even though they continue to dominate local news in key areas and aid data collection â they generally only appear on national news in a negative light, reinforcing views of his handling of the pandemic or amplifying the kind of rhetoric which has turned off older voters and suburban women.Biden, whose running mate Kamala Harris was off the campaign trail for several days after a senior aide tested positive for COVID-19, also surprised many by winning the TV ratings war as the candidates took part in competing town hall events last week.But eyes now turn to the last presidential debate, with Trump already telling supporters that the moderator, NBC News' Kristen Welker, is "terrible and unfair" and the campaigns arguing over the topics due for discussion on Thursday evening.Trump is scheduled to continue his rallies through the week, while Biden is huddling down with advisers preparing for the final mass viewership event of the election â a debate where fireworks are expected, as the president tries to knock his challenger out of his comfort zone and the Democrat aims to keep things steady with the clocking ticking ever closer to November 3.Video: Wang Zengzheng and Zhou TingyuScript: John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.Editor's note: The story is part of our continuing World Factory series, which delves into the trajectory of China's economic growth amid a changing geopolitical landscape, the pandemic and a global economic recession. Here are the first, second and third stories. The trade war and the pandemic have fueled speculation about a potential wave of offshoring from China.But Trueanalog Strictly OEM, a high-end audio speaker factory based in Guangzhou, continues to operate in China. And it has no plans to leave, said Philip Richardson, the factory's American owner. The factory manufactures loudspeakers for the world's top speaker brands, e.g. Avantone, and most of its products are exported to Europe and the U.S. The facility employs around 20 workers and has found its niche, targeting the premium market segment â home stereo speakers or headphones with a price tag over $1,000. "I don't know a single American speaker factory that moved outside of China. This is where the greatest resources of parts are... right here," said Richardson. China dominates the production of raw materials required to make speakers, including magnet, copper, aluminum and low carbon steel, he added. The vertical integration of Chinese supply chains is a major reason why little production has gone offshore, according to Emily Jiang, purchasing manager of Triangle, a French high-end speaker manufacturer. Most parts are sourced from the Yangtze River Delta Region and the Pearl River Delta Region, and can be easily shipped to manufacturers. "It is so easy to procure parts that go into speakers domestically," she noted, "which is why we won't go to Southeast Asian countries where many still depend on China for the supply of parts." China has become the world's manufacturing powerhouse over the past two decades. In 2010, the value created in China by manufacturing surpassed the U.S., making it the largest manufacturer in the world, according to data from the World Bank. But China's labor-cost advantage is disappearing. Wages have gone up 15 to 20 percent per year, shrinking the total cost advantage of doing businesses in China. Amid the rising labor cost, some low-end manufacturing, like garment production, has moved to Southeast Asia. But what has made China a vital manufacturing hub is not just cheap labor, but a skilled workforce, especially in fields which involve intricate hand work. Speaker production is still a labor-intensive industry, according to Richardson. For example, a worker needs to install the wires on a loudspeaker coin, a task that is impossible for robots to handle, at least for now."It is in the DNA of Chinese workers to work hard and do a good job," said Richardson. Contrary to conventional belief that factories in China are stuffed by young laborers, many workers at Trueanalog are over the age of 30 and have been at the factory for more than five years. For Richardson, his workers are integral to the success of his businesses. At the factory, workers are allowed to take a 10-minute break every two hours, and follow a schedule of five days a week, eight hours per day. "This work schedule is rare in Chinese OEM factories," said a female worker on the production line, who is from landlocked Sichuan Province.The pandemic dealt a heavy blow to the global supply chain. Global manufacturing output declined in the second quarter by 11.2 percent in a year-over-year comparison, following a drop by six percent in the previous quarter, according to data from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. But China's manufacturing PMI has remained in expansion territory since February this year, and its exports have surged since June. Richardson's factory has been working around the clock to meet that surging demand. The pandemic has given him a boost since April, he said. Because consumers are spending more time at home, sales have gone up 30 percent for Trueanalog. China's total export of speakers also jumped in recent months, with the figures for July and August higher than in the same months last year, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. The pandemic, in a way, has highlighted countries' reliance on China for the supply chain. Some countries have tried to lure businesses back to their home countries in the post-pandemic world. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, has called for American companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but that does not seem to be happening "en masse." According to a survey done by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which included responses from 340 companies, 92 percent of them said they had no plans to move out of China, and only 5.1 percent of companies with global revenues over 500 million U.S. dollars planned to leave. "It is simply too expensive to manufacture in the U.S.," said Richardson. While it costs companies around $75 per hour to employ an American worker, it takes only $30 per day ($3.75 per hour) to hire a skilled Chinese worker in the speaker production industry. Even if companies ship the semi-products from China and assemble them in the U.S., it would still be too costly, he added. He was once approached by an American customer to make three-inch drivers in the U.S. But after doing a cost analysis, he realized that it would cost American manufacturers an additional $20 per speaker to assemble them in the U.S. "For people saying China is taking away jobs, noâ¦.It is simply a matter of economics," he noted. Writer: Yu Jing Videographer: Shen LanglangVideo editors: Amy Chen, Yu Jing Data editor: Hu YiweiCover image: Pan YufeiOn Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump nominated conservative federal appellate Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died from complications of pancreatic cancer earlier this month."She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution," Trump said of Barrett from the White House Rose Garden."This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation."The announcement came at a time when nearly six in 10 Americans say the president elected in November should be the one to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Meanwhile, 44 percent of respondents think the current court is "about right" in terms of ideological leanings, while 34 percent think it is too conservative and 22% too liberal, according to the same poll.If confirmed after Senate hearings in mid-October, Barrett would bring the number of conservative justices to six on the nine-member court â a dramatic turn to the right that could have far-reaching impact on the country's judicial and political development long after President Trump exits the White House.With the Republicans holding a 53-47 advantage in the Senate, Trump appears to have a clear path to having his third Supreme Court pick confirmed, after Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.What does a 6-3 court means?Trump's timely nomination has set off media speculation about unwinding decades of liberal progress on a wide range of issues from voting to abortion, and bringing American jurisprudence back decades.If Barrett joins, she would be the sixth Catholic on the bench and the fifth woman to do so in the court's 231-year history.Since the end of World War II, the U.S. Supreme Court has kept a balance of 5-4, with the majority being liberal or conservative. The intricate balance has kept the court from being one-sided, since one vote from the other camp could help tip the court's decision to its favor. However, a 6-3 bench could mean the conservatives can afford to lose one vote and still prevail.With a dominant majority and hence a more predictable outcome, the conservative camp â Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh with the addition of Amy Coney Barrett â will also be more emboldened to direct America's highest court to take on controversial cases which have been sidestepped in the past when the outcome was less clear with a 5-4 bench.Appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005, the generally conservative Chief Justice John G. Roberts has functioned as a swing vote on some key occasions, including siding with his liberal colleagues to uphold the Affordable Care Act in 2012. Now, the only three liberal justices would have to pursue Roberts plus another conservative Justice in order to come up on top in any decision. A 6-3 conservative bench would likely loosen restrictions on fire arms which many Republicans see as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Besides, the advancement of LGBT rights in recent decades would also likely experience significant challenges as religious rights expands. However, no issue is as divisive as abortion.As a candidate, Trump has promised to overturn Roe v. Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision which legalized abortion in the U.S. With a third Trump justice, it is likely that this campaign promise could materialize.Who is Barrett?During her nomination speech, Barrett praised the legacy left behind by Justice Ginsburg for having "smashed" the glass ceiling for women in the legal profession. However, carrying a proven conservative record voting record on a range of issues including gun rights and abortion, she will likely take the opposite end of the ideological spectrum as the woman she's set to replace."A judge must apply the law as written," she said. "Judges are not policy makers."The statement is an homage to the legal principle known as originalism which argues the constitution should be interpreted based on the original intent of the authors at the time it was ratified. This concept was evangelized by the giant of conservative jurisprudence, Justice Antonin Scalia whom Barrett clerked for from 1998 to 1999.While Scalia's approach to the constitution has sometimes led him to liberal conclusions, Barrett's legal opinions have been more influenced by her lifelong devotion to Catholicism.During her teaching career at Notre Dame, she often invoked God in articles and speeches, according to the Associated Press. In a 2006 address, she encouraged graduating law students to see their careers as a means to "building the kingdom of God."Barrett was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1972. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company and her mother a high school French teacher. She attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship and graduated with honors. She is also mom to seven children. Editor's note: THIS IS CHINA is an original animated series CGTN Digital presents for the Two Sessions. Each episode focuses on the most popular topics and trends in China, recounting how China's economy and society, guided by government policies, have evolved in the new era.  The key term in this episode: The Cashless Era.Spending a day without cash or bank cards is perfectly unremarkable in China.More than three-quarters of Chinese people were using digital payment in preference to cash by 2017 and the number has continued to rise. Eighty-six percent now use mobile payment, whether to pay utility bills, travel short or long distances, make appointments at hospital or go grocery shopping. The growth in use of digital payment has been supported by the development of advanced technologies. According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the number of 4G base stations in China totaled 5.44 million in 2019 â more than half of the world's total. With the innovation of the QR code, online and offline payments have been further combined.Read more:China's QR code industry to be worth multi-trillions of yuan by 2025Common Destiny: 'QR code planters' bring cashless payment to the worldMobile payment platforms WeChat Pay and Alipay have also contributed to the development of the cashless society in China.In recent years, Bluetooth payment, biometric payment, sonic payment, AR/VR payment and other emerging payment methods have been launched.Meanwhile, the number of 5G base stations in use nationwide has exceeded 200,000 according to the latest data from the MIIT, which means that China has hit the "fast-forward" button on the construction of Internet infrastructure.The proportion of 5G users in China is expected to increase to nearly 50 percent by 2025, and 5G commercialization will create more possibilities for the growth of the cashless era.Read more:5G Phones will outsell 4G by 2023China leads global race in key 5G patents: reportThe country's internet availability rate has increased by 3.8 percentage points year on year to 59.6 percent, according to the 43rd statistical report from the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), further laying the foundation for a high rate of online payment users.The central bank and other financial authorities have announced they want to spread the benefits of going cashless to the four out of 10 people in China who still live in rural areas. According to the central bank, 66.5 percent of people in rural areas were already using digital payments by 2017.Read more:China's mobile payment enters overseas marketsAlipay's worldwide users exceed 1 billionIn fact, mobile payment also helps the sharing economy, e-retailing, digital governance, education and healthcare as well as other emerging technologies, business fields and models, such as smart governance, smart hospitals, automated payment and other industrial applications.The merits and convenience of a cashless society are significant, but concerns over safety and privacy also need to be addressed. And the risk that a cashless society could marginalize older and less tech-savvy spenders and the less well-off also need to be considered.Read more:China's central bank regulates forced cashless payment Editor: Duan FengyuanCopy Editor: John GoodrichChief Editor: Chen RanSenior Consultant: Dr. Xia JixuanProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiAn Israeli delegation made a visit to Sudan on Wednesday to discuss normalizing ties, Israeli public broadcaster Kan radio said, as a minister predicted a possible diplomatic breakthrough between the two countries.Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Israel's media that he believed Israel was "very close to normalizing ties with Sudan."Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and the Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment when asked about prospects for a breakthrough with Sudan. In a foreign-policy flourish ahead of his re-election bid, top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump this week escorted Israeli delegates to Bahrain and UAE delegates to Israel, cementing Israel's new, U.S.-brokered relations with the Gulf states.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the United States had begun the process of removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and was also working "diligently" to get Khartoum to recognize Israel.Pompeo stopped short of saying Sudan's removal would be linked to whether it would agree to normalize relations with Israel. Sudanese sources have not indicated so far that normalization talks were far advanced.Israeli Regional Cooperation Minister Ofir Akunis said that the United States would announce another deal establishing ties between Israel and an Arab or Muslim country before the U.S. election."I have a reasonable basis to believe that the announcement will come before November 3 â that, if you'll permit me, is what I understand from my sources," Akunis told Israel's Army Radio.Akunis said several countries were candidates to normalize relations with Israel. He did not name these, saying that it was "customary" to let the first official word come from Washington."More nations that are in the Arab League will normalize and make peace with Israel, I have no doubt, it is a certainty.

The vessels had previously been scheduled to work until October 22.NATO members Turkey and Greece are at odds over conflicting claims to hydrocarbon resources in the eastern Mediterranean and overlapping views on the extent of their continental shelves. Tensions flared in August when Ankara sent Oruc Reis to waters also claimed by Greece and Cyprus.Ankara had withdrawn Oruc Reis last month to "allow for diplomacy" before a European Union summit at which Cyprus sought sanctions against Turkey, but sent it back this month, prompting an angry rebuke from Greece, France and Germany.After the summit, the bloc said it would punish Turkey if it continued its operations in the region, in a move Ankara said further strained Turkey-EU ties. Turkey says its operations are within its continental shelf.In recent weeks the war of words between Turkey, Greece and Cyprus has escalated to shows of military strength, with military drills taking place in the region.Earlier on Wednesday, Greece urged the EU to reconsider its customs union with Turkey in response to Ankara's exploration in the Mediterranean, deploring what it termed Turkey's "imperial fantasies."Turkey said on Wednesday it had extended the stay of its Oruc Reis survey vessel and two other ships in a disputed area of the eastern Mediterranean until October 27, in a move likely to further escalate tensions in the region.Two other vessels, the Ataman and Cengiz Han, along with Oruc Reis will continue working in an area southeast of the Greek island of Rhodes until October 27, Turkey's Navy said in a maritime notice.

Tony Evers' capacity order- limiting the number of people who can gather in bars, restaurants and indoor venues to 25 percent of capacity.

"With no single piece of evidence, they (Sweden) are just suppressing Chinese telecom companies under the excuse of [threatening] national security."They are politicizing normal economic activities, Zhao said.Stockholm announced the decision ahead of the spectrum auction scheduled for next month. According to the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS), the setting of the licence conditions followed assessments by the Swedish Armed Forces and security service, which has called China "one of the biggest threats against Sweden."The Swedish authorities gave companies in the auction a deadline of January 1, 2025 to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment from their existing infrastructure."The ban leaves network operators with less options and risks slowing the roll out of 5G in markets where competition is reduced," said Ben Wood, chief of research at leading research mobile communication company CCS Insight, as quoted by Reuters. Sweden-based telecommunications giant Ericsson, Huawei's biggest rival in 5G technology, may likely be one of the beneficiaries.British political and international relations analyst Tom Fowdy questioned the legitimacy of the move. Specifically, he pointed out that Swedish products have been widely valued and put in use in China, "one must question whether it is fair that Sweden is banning Huawei and ZTE. Is this the reciprocity on market access that Europe keeps asking for?""China is opening its markets, but as seen by the new entity list and export control laws, it is also equipping itself with tools to deal with countries that are not playing fairly," Fowdy wrote in a CGTN opinion piece.On Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm also rejected accusations that Huawei and ZTE posed threats to Sweden's national security."We urge the Swedish government to abide by the market principles of open development and fair competition, and reconsider the relevant decision," the embassy wrote on its website."We are resolutely opposed to abusing the concept of 'national security' and â¦ rejecting specific enterprises from specific countries," it added.Sweden's ban on two Chinese telecommunication companies, Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp., from its 5G networks on Tuesday has drawn strong opposition from Beijing."Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp. have been strictly abiding by local laws," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Wednesday.

Is this the reciprocity on market access that Europe keeps asking for?""China is opening its markets, but as seen by the new entity list and export control laws, it is also equipping itself with tools to deal with countries that are not playing fairly," Fowdy wrote in a CGTN opinion piece.On Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm also rejected accusations that Huawei and ZTE posed threats to Sweden's national security."We urge the Swedish government to abide by the market principles of open development and fair competition, and reconsider the relevant decision," the embassy wrote on its website."We are resolutely opposed to abusing the concept of 'national security' and â¦ rejecting specific enterprises from specific countries," it added.China has never intended to challenge or replace anyone, Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, stressing what it cares most about is to improve the well-being of its own people.Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the remarks when responding to a new initiative revealed by the U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Tuesday which appealed to expand U.S. alliances with "like-minded democracies" and advance U.S. arms sales in order to counter Russia and China.Stressing that China expects a peaceful and stable world, Zhao said that China has always been committed to advancing the well-being of the Chinese people and realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.According to Zhao, viewing China as a rival is a serious strategic misjudgment that will lead to the U.S. investing its strategic resources in the wrong direction.It does not help the mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries, added Zhao, warning the move may also harm regional and global peace and stability.China's policy towards the U.S. is highly stable and consistent. China urges the U.S. politicians to discard their old Cold War mentality and zero-sum view and treat China's relations with U.S. and Russia with an objective and rational attitude, said Zhao.The spokesperson advised the two sides to meet each other halfway and drag the bilateral relations back to the right track.China has never intended to challenge or replace anyone, Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, stressing what it cares most about is to improve the well-being of its own people.Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for Chinese Foreign Ministry, made the remarks when responding to a new initiative revealed by the U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Tuesday which appealed to expand U.S. alliances with "like-minded democracies" and advance U.S. arms sales in order to counter Russia and China.Stressing that China expects a peaceful and stable world, Zhao said that China has always been committed to advancing the well-being of the Chinese people and realizing the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.According to Zhao, viewing China as a rival is a serious strategic misjudgment that will lead to the U.S. investing its strategic resources in the wrong direction.It does not help the mutual trust and cooperation between the two countries, added Zhao, warning the move may also harm regional and global peace and stability.China's policy towards the U.S. is highly stable and consistent.

These agencies must be able to develop, review, and disseminate public health data, guidelines, and other information that are based on science, facts, and medical principles â and not the political imperatives and moods of a president and his advisors," the letter said.The GOA will "determine whether this interference has violated the agencies' scientific integrity and communication policies," according to a press release from Warren's official website.The Trump administration has reportedly been pressuring staff at the health agency to change key CDC recommendations and allegedly interfered in publications of reports regarded as contradicting Trump's description of the pandemic as under control.(Cover: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is the national public health institute of the U.S. /Reuters)An independent U.S. government watchdog will launch an investigation into whether the administration of President Donald Trump inappropriately intervened in the coronavirus work of the country's top public health agencies, USA Today reported.The newspaper reported that the Government Accountability Office (GAO), a legislative agency that evaluates government work for Congress, agreed on Monday to assess Trump officials' political moves linked to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Charles Young, a spokesman for the GAO, told USA Today that "we expect the work will start in January, as staff who cover those issues become available."The paper said that the investigation was at the request of Senate Democrats, including Senator Elizabeth Warren."The CDC and FDA's independence as scientific agencies is crucial to safeguarding the public health and saving lives.

His so-called forced labor claim and other issues are typical cases of fabrication, spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Tuesday in response to the U.S. Secretary of State, who criticized China over "forced labor" and religion restriction in Northwestern China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.Zhao said all laborers in Xinjiang, including ethnic minorities, are equally protected by China's labor laws, and they're free to choose their professions and locations of work. There is no restriction on them.Pompeo had made a statement on monitoring and combating trafficking in persons on the department's website, claiming that there are mass forced laborers in Xinjiang and that it is a part of China's campaign of repression against Uygurs and other ethnic and religious minority groups in the region.In recent years, China has strengthened its efforts to fight against terrorism and poverty in Xinjiang. Under China's nationwide poverty alleviation project, tens of millions of Chinese have been lifted out of penury, including people in Xinjiang, which has a huge population living below the poverty line. Part of the project is relocation, meaning moving people from poor mountainous villages to places with abundant resources, like towns and cities, where companies supported by the government can help them land a job or start small businesses due to the centralization.Read more: Does 'forced Uygur labor' truly exist in China?Zorehan Metniyaz, a 35-year-old woman who used to feed her family by herding sheep in a village, began learning greenhouse vegetable growing skills in 2018 after moving to a relocation site in Xinjiang's Hotan Prefecture, where featured agricultural industries, like vegetable greenhouses, are supported by the local government. One year after the relocating, she made 35,000 yuan (roughly $5,242) â about five times more than before. After tasting the sweet, she rented another greenhouse to plant strawberries."For people who want to learn greenhouse skills, we would distribute greenhouses to them, but if they prefer to take a job in big cities, we would send them to Korla. There are factories, and they can first learn skills before becoming formal employees," Chen Pengfei, the party chief of the relocation site, explained.

Local officials said that their work now is not persuading people to move into new houses but to make sure there will be no conflict because some people who don't "meet the criterion but also want to move into a new house.""At the beginning of the relocation program, it was hard to persuade some elders, who hold deep affection to their homeland, to leave, and we had to put in a lot of work.

As of Tuesday, more than 4.6 million Texans have voted, according to the U.S. Elections Project.That's more than half of the ballots counted for the 2016 presidential election, Fox News reports.The state also saw a jump in voter registration this year. According to the Texas secretary of state, 17 million people became new voters in Texas. An increase of almost 2 million compared to 2016.On Monday, Florida broke its record for the opening day of early-voting. Considered a critical battleground state to watch in the election, at least 350,000 voters cast their ballots.Republicans had a slight lead in voter turnout for the first day of in-person voting in Florida.43% of Mondayâs voters were registered Republicans and 42% were registered Democrats, according to the Hill. Overall, voter turnout in Florida grew by almost 17% compared to the 2016 election.Georgia also saw a surge in early voting compared to 2016. Based off state data, with almost 1.7 million people voting, turnout jumped 142% in the first eight days compared to the same time four years ago.As millions of votes come in across the U.S., it's unclear how long it will take to count them all, which means a clear winner might not be decided by the end of the night on November 3rd.The process for receiving and counting votes also differs by state. Some have already received extensions for receiving and counting votes to accommodate for the pandemic. Mail-in ballots have to be postmarked by Election Day but they can be received and counted late in some states. For example in Washington State, mail-in ballots can be received until November 23rd. But in most states the deadline for receiving ballots is one to two days after the election.After votes are counted, states must certify their results, which typically takes about two weeks. But if a recount is needed, a stateâs deadline can be extended.Once the election results are certified, the electoral college begins its process of assigning electors and casting votes.In some states, officials are already counting votes but releasing the results prior to the election is against the law. National opinion polls show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the lead over incumbent President Donald Trump. Election experts warn even though voters are showing up in record numbers, opinion polls and voter turnout can't always guarantee a winner.Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

The coronavirus pandemic and severe flooding have added to its woes.Removal from the terrorism list â once Khartoum sets aside $335 million it agreed to pay to U.S. victims of militant attacks and their families â could help ease economic pain, partly by unlocking international financing and debt relief.Washington has offered Sudan development and humanitarian help, U.S. and Gulf-based sources said in September, after U.S. officials and military head General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan discussed the issue of Israel in September.But while the United States has been lobbying hard for Sudan to normalize ties with Israel just as it finalizes Khartoum's removal from the list, Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has argued the two issues should not be linked."It is not possible for an entire people to be forced to normalize in a week or two," acting Finance Minister Hiba Mohamed Ali told Sudanese TV on Monday."If it is our wish to normalize relations with Israel, we must give a suitable chance for the issue to be studied in detail."Despite apparent support from Burhan, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda in February, and his military deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who recently praised Israel's economic development, a rapid move to normalize ties could fracture the civilian coalition they share power with."Our view of the Zionist entity remained fixed â that it is a racist entity hostile to all national liberation movements," said Sadiq Farouk, a Communist Party leader from the coalition that backs the government.Hamdok has said he is not authorized to decide on ties with Israel. "With this position, Hamdok wants to avoid any decision that might lead to a split in the ruling coalition that supports the government," said Fath Alrahman Ahmed of Khartoum's Al-Neelain University.Recognizing Israel could also trigger a backlash from Islamist factions loyal to Bashir that have sought to discredit the transition.Still, people have been able to signal support for establishing ties publicly for the first time.A former member of parliament, Abulgasem Bartum, says he is planning a private trip with 40 Sudanese businesspersons, sportspeople and cultural figures to Israel as a confidence building measure next month.In Jerusalem, Zvi Hauser, chairman of the Israeli parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, told public broadcaster Kan Israel could help the region with science and technology and he hoped Sudan joined the "wave" of recognition.Some younger Sudanese, less wedded to the Palestinian cause than their parents or grandparents, say they could also back the move."I have no objection to Sudan having normal relations with Israel if this is in the interest of the country," said Ahmed Ibrahim, a 30-year-old telecommunications company employee."We want jobs, health, education and a better life ...

In March, ASPI issued a report claiming that at least 80,000 Uygurs were relocated to factories in Xinjiang as forced labors between 2017 to 2019 in order to control them.China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region refuted the claim. The spokesperson for the Information Office of Xinjiang, Elijan Anayit, noted that the APSI has long been receiving funds from the U.S. government and arm dealers. Anayit said it deliberately smears, vilifies and demonizes China for the investors' benefits.Ironically, the latest APAC report found out the reports published by ASPI were funded by weapon makers relying on prison labors in "a significant proportion."The APAC report also pointed out that despite its claims of producing independent research, ASPI is a Commonwealth-owned company, which has never publicly disclosed the full extent of millions of dollars in payments from the defense department, foreign governments and weapons manufacturers.While its anti-China propaganda has been attracting audience, the reports from ASPI have incurred condemnations from former foreign ministers, diplomats, defense personnel, Commonwealth public service chiefs and senior media commentators.The APAC News published a latest report revealing that the Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI), a defense and strategic policy think tank based in Canberra, Australia, has received millions of dollars of funding from corporations directly profiting from forced prison labor.APAC, a Sydney-based news outlet, found that at least 11 financial backers of ASPS "have either directly or indirectly been involved in prisons and the use of prison labor and/or implicated in human trafficking." Among them, four major long-term financial backers â BAE Systems, Lockheed Martin, Boeing and Raytheon â have relied upon prison labor to build components used in their military hardware.This report compiled data from U.S. Bureau of Prisons, UNICOR, United States Department of Justice, Human Rights Watch, Wired, Reuters, The Guardian, Business Insider, Harvard Prison Divest Campaign, prisonlegalnews.org and Center for Research on Globalization, and mapped out the link between ASPI and the "prison industry."The ASPI has been reporting extensively on human right issues in China.

He described the visit as "a glorious day for peace."  "Today, we are making history in a way that will stand for generations," the right-wing premier said of the Israeli-UAE accord, which has been angrily denounced by the Palestinians.   The two states signed four agreements on Monday, including one "exempting our nationals from visas," Netanyahu announced, arguing that free movement of people would offer benefits to the Israeli and Emirati economies. Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, described Tuesday's UAE visit as "shameful." Speaking in Ramallah, in the Israel-occupied West Bank, he said it came amid Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank. "The bilateral agreements that were announced today and the delegations that come and go, all of that offers the occupation a strength to escalate its aggression and its crimes against the Palestinian people and increases its intransigence and arrogance," he said. In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, a spokesman for the Islamist group Hamas, said, "Such a visit will only encourage the occupation to pursue the gradual annexation of West Bank lands."The five-hour visit would be restricted to the airport near Tel Aviv due to coronavirus concerns, Israeli organizers said. (With input from agencies; Cover: CFP)Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed Monday to reciprocal visa-free travel, making Emirati citizens the first in the Arab world to be exempted from Israeli entry permits.   The deal was signed after the first-ever official delegation from the UAE landed in Israel for a day of talks following an agreement to normalize ties signed at the White House last month.   Wearing a mask, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greeted the UAE delegation at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.

But besides free publicity, some of these companies are also profiting from the race. Unlike Twitter, which banned political ads, Facebook is still running them, and Trump's and Biden's expenditures on this platform have hit $165 million since the beginning of the year.According to information available at the Facebook Ad Library, and analysed by CGTN Digital, between January 1 and October 17, Democratic candidate Joe Biden poured in $82.71 million and President Donald Trump $82.38 million into the platform.Since January this year, the Republican candidate has been spending on Facebook ads, but has now been surpassed by Biden. The Democrat started investing more heavily at the beginning of August, before being formally nominated by the party, and then intensified spending after the nomination. In the week between October 11 to 17 and the last 30 days (September 18 â October 17), Biden outran Trump in terms of expenditures on Facebook. In that week alone, the Democrat side spent $7.14 million and the Republicans another $4.51 million. Biden is certainly using part of the $383 million raised in September, a significant $135 million more than Trump's $248 million.Starting this month, the president has been spending less and less, which might be considered a strange move, as polls show voters are giving the lead to the Democrats, and increasing social media campaign could help bridge the gap with its specific targeting.Besides, his presidential campaign gained a reputation for running the strongest digital ad promotion in 2016, which might mean a new push before the seven-day ad ban on Facebook is implemented. The company decided in September to restrict new political ads in the week before the election and remove posts that convey misinformation about COVID-19 and voting as to avoid being used to sow chaos and spread misinformation before, during, and after the U.S. presidential election.

Armenia denied firing it.The ceasefire was agreed on Saturday after an earlier deal brokered by Russia failed to halt the deadliest clashes in the South Caucasus since the 1990s.So far, the main driver of diplomacy between the ex-Soviet enemies has been Russia. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev both told Russia's TASS news agency in separate interviews on Monday that they were ready to come to Moscow for talks.The failure to stop the fighting has raised fears of a humanitarian crisis, and put new strains on ties between Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan, and its NATO allies which want the conflict to end.Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway enclave of Azerbaijan that is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, said 729 of its military personnel and 36 civilians had been killed in fighting that began on September 27. Azerbaijan said 61 Azeri civilians had been killed and 282 wounded. It has not disclosed its military casualties.Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri forces were shelling their positions in northern and southern areas of the line of contact that divides them.They said Azeri forces had shelled civilian settlements including the town of Martuni and four villages - charges that were denied by Azerbaijan. They reported one civilian killed and one wounded in Martuni.The Azeri defense ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Agjebedin, Tovuz and Dashkesan regions far from the conflict zone â accusations denied by Armenia.The ministry also said Terter and Aghdam regions were under shelling. AzTV state television said one of its journalists was wounded in Terter.The Azeri prosecutor general's office said Armenia had targeted a pipeline in the Khizi district of Azerbaijan, more than 300 km (186 miles) from the conflict zone, on Sunday afternoon. The pipeline, which carries oil to Novorossiisk in Russia, was not damaged but some missile fragments fell about 250 meters (820 feet) away, it said.Dismissing the report, Armenian defense ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said: "It's a total lie.âA ceasefire brokered in Moscow earlier this month was aimed at letting the sides swap detainees and bodies of those killed, but it had little impact on the fighting.The new ceasefire was announced on Saturday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov talked to the Armenian and Azeri foreign ministers by telephone.A new ceasefire in the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh was in jeopardy on Monday with Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces reporting shelling and heavy fighting.Among accusations on both sides, Azerbaijan said it had "neutralized" a missile fired by Armenian forces at an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan on Sunday, several hours after the ceasefire went into force.

into the most strict "Tier Three" lockdown. This would force pubs and bars that aren't serving food to close. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has refused to implement the measures, calling the government's assessment "exaggerated."One UK minister said "extra resources" had been offered to the Greater Manchester area amid concerns about protecting jobs and suggested a deal could be close. Burnham, though, says "nothing's changed."Ministers say they want a deal by Tuesday at the latest, to avoid a lockdown being imposed â against the wishes of city authorities.Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to avoid a national lockdown in England, preferring a more targeted approach to restrictions, which he hopes will limit economic damage as the UK â like much of Europe â suffers a second wave of the coronavirus this fall.The UK's devolved nations have opted for blanket restrictions. Northern Ireland's schools started a two-week closure from Monday, as part of new measures that began on Friday evening. Wales, is expected to announce a two-week "circuit-breaker" lockdown on Monday. Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamPolice have revealed there have been multiple incidents involving young people hosting parties in hotels after bars and restaurants were shut across the Netherlands on Thursday.Hotels are still open and many are offering rooms at cheap prices, with young people using them to break COVID-19 rules and throw parties.There has also been further controversy after King Willem-Alexander flew to Greece on holiday just hours after the new measures were announced. He returned to the country just one day later after his actions were widely condemned across the country."We can see people's reactions to media reports. And they are fierce, and they affect us," wrote the Dutch royal family in a statement. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he knew the king would leave, but he didn't realize it would send out the wrong message. The Dutch PM is politically responsible for all actions by the king and will now have to face tough questions from Parliament.Over the past seven days, there was an average of 7,661 positive tests per day in the Netherlands, compared with 5,537 a week earlier â an increase of 40 percent. Ross Cullen in ParisMore than 60,000 new infections were recorded this weekend in France, as cases of COVID-19 continue to rise.

This would force pubs and bars that aren't serving food to close. Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham has refused to implement the measures, calling the government's assessment "exaggerated."One UK minister said "extra resources" had been offered to the Greater Manchester area amid concerns about protecting jobs and suggested a deal could be close. Burnham, though, says "nothing's changed."Ministers say they want a deal by Tuesday at the latest, to avoid a lockdown being imposed â against the wishes of city authorities.Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he wants to avoid a national lockdown in England, preferring a more targeted approach to restrictions, which he hopes will limit economic damage as the UK â like much of Europe â suffers a second wave of the coronavirus this fall.The UK's devolved nations have opted for blanket restrictions. Northern Ireland's schools started a two-week closure from Monday, as part of new measures that began on Friday evening.

And they are fierce, and they affect us," wrote the Dutch royal family in a statement. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said he knew the king would leave, but he didn't realize it would send out the wrong message.

To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40 percent of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.Arce, a former economy minister regarded as the leftist heir to former leader Evo Morales, sounded confident of victory without explicitly claiming the win at his own news conference shortly after midnight in the Bolivian capital La Paz."Very grateful for the support and trust of the Bolivian people," Arce posted on Twitter early Monday after the exit poll results were published. "We have recovered democracy, and we will regain stability and social peace."The official count, which could take days, was less than 8 percent completed by 2:00 a.m. (0600 GMT). The usual rapid count had been abandoned after allegations of irregularities last year that led to Morales' November 2019 resignation after 14 years in power.Interim president Jeanine Anez, who was not a candidate, congratulated Arce and his running mate David Choquehuanca on their apparent win."We still do not have an official count, but from the data we have, Mr Arce and Mr Choquehuanca have won the election.

Many touted signs and rainbow colored homemade banners calling for a "yes" vote next Sunday in a referendum over whether to scrap the country's constitution, which was adopted in 1980 during the regime of General Augusto Pinochet.The morning brought a largely festive atmosphere to the protests at Plaza Italia. Many showed up wearing masks to protect against the coronavirus pandemic, held up banners, sang and danced. Police even gradually pulled back from the Plaza Italia."It's great, very good and positive. They're pure good things for Chile in everything from here," demonstrator Viviana Donoso, 43, told AFP as she and a group of people danced to drums."The people of Chile need to unite, and we have to believe that we can do things."Some even turned up to the demonstration in fancy dress. Demonstrators also called for their countrymen to vote to "approve" the proposed constitutional change, a key demand of the 2019 protests."This is the opportunity to say enough! We're here and we're going to vote for 'Approve,'" Paulina Villarroel, a 29-year-old psychologist, told AFP.Police estimated that Sunday's rally in Santiago attracted around 25,000 people by 6 p.m., far smaller than the largest protests of 2019.The demonstrations, while largely peaceful early on, were marred by increasing incidents of violence, looting of supermarkets and clashes with police across the capital later in the day. Fire truck sirens, burning barricades on roadways and fireworks on downtown streets added to a sense of chaos in some neighborhoods.Interior Minister Victor Perez spoke late in the evening, praising the early, peaceful rallies while blasting the late-night mayhem. He called on Chileans to settle their differences by voting in the upcoming constitutional referendum."Those who carry out these acts of violence do not want Chileans to solve our problems through democratic means," Perez told reporters, vowing to punish those who crossed the line Sunday.Early in the day, an angry mob jeered and threatened a Communist Party mayor. Later, masked individuals firebombed a police headquarters and church. Vandals attacked another Santiago church in the early evening, setting its spire aflame and choking side streets with smoke.More than 15 metro stations were temporarily closed amid the unrest. Police fired tear gas and water cannons in skirmishes with sometimes violent, hooded and masked people.Last year's protests, which began October 18, raged until mid-December as Chileans gathered nationwide to call for reforms to the pension, healthcare and education systems. Rioting and looting resulted in billions of dollars in damage and losses to the country's businesses and infrastructure. The unrest saw the military take to the streets for the first time since the rule of Augusto Pinochet.In the past few days, small-scale demonstrations and isolated incidents of violence have nonetheless resurfaced in Chile, as the capital's six million citizens emerge from months of confinement following the COVID-19 pandemic.Most demonstrators on Sunday wore masks, but many could be seen in tight groups, raising concerns about a potential health risk.(With input from agencies)Tens of thousands of Chileans gathered in the central square of Santiago to mark the one-year anniversary of mass protests that left over 30 dead and thousands injured, with peaceful rallies on Sunday devolving by nightfall into riots and looting.People gathered early in the day in demonstrations downtown and in cities throughout Chile that gained size and fervor through the evening.

Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory," the embassy said.China and the Pacific island country established diplomatic relations in 1975.According to official Chinese data, the bilateral trade reached over $482 million in 2018, representing a 26-percent increase from the year before.China highly appreciates the Fijian government for upholding the one-China principle and expects that the Fijian side will tackle this issue properly, the embassy said.Foreign Ministry: Taiwan is playing the trick of a thief crying 'stop thief'The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday said Taiwan is playing the trick of a thief crying "stop thief," and stressed that any attempt to use the Taiwan issue to provoke ties between China and Pacific island countries will not succeed.There is no "diplomatic relationship" between Taiwan and Fiji, said spokesperson Zhao Lijian. The Fijian government has always adhered to the one-China principle, and it urged Taiwan's business institution to stop creating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" in 2019, which China highly appreciates, he said.Zhao reiterated that there is only one China in the world and Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory.A Chinese diplomat in Fiji was injured earlier this month after a Taipei Trade Office employee provoked embassy staff at a local hotel, the Chinese Embassy in Fiji said on Monday.The Taipei Trade Office in Fiji held a so-called National Day event at the Grand Pacific Hotel in Suva on October 8, a move that violates the one-China principle as it sought to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" internationally, the embassy said in a statement.The staff from the trade office "acted provocatively against the Chinese Embassy staff who were carrying out their official duties in the public area outside the function venue, causing damage and injuries to one Chinese diplomat," it said."We have expressed our serious concerns to the Fijian side about the above incidents, requesting the Police Force of Fiji to carry out thorough investigation into the incidents and hold the perpetrators accountable according to law."Earlier, a Reuters report said two Chinese diplomats attacked an official from the Taipei office who ended up in the hospital."There is only one China in the world, and the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legitimate government representing the whole of China.

The record-shattering figure is being driven in part by concerns about crowds at polling sites on Election Day amid the coronavirus pandemic.In North Carolina, a battleground where 1.4 million, or 20 percent, of the state's registered voters, had already voted as of Sunday morning, Biden urged residents to cast ballots as soon as possible. "We gotta keep the incredible momentum going; we can't let up," he said at a "drive-in rally" in Durham, as attendees sitting in their cars honked in approval. "Don't wait - go vote today."Biden also criticized Trump for saying over the weekend that the U.S. had "turned the corner" in the coronavirus pandemic, noting that the rate of new cases across the country has risen to the highest level in months."As my grandfather would say, 'This guy's gone around the bend if he thinks we've turned the corner,'" Biden said. "Things are getting worse, and he continues to lie to us about circumstances."Biden's pick for vice president, Senator Kamala Harris, canceled in-person events over the weekend as a precaution after an aide tested positive for COVID-19. She will return to the campaign trail on Monday with a visit to Florida to mark that state's first day of early in-person voting.Harris tested negative for the virus on Sunday, the campaign said.Trump, a Republican, was spending his Sunday in Nevada, a state he hopes to wrest away from Democrats after narrowly losing it in 2016. Early in-person voting in the state began on Saturday.The president, who rarely goes to church but has remained popular among evangelical Christians for his opposition to abortion and for appointing conservative judges, began his day by attending a service at the International Church of Las Vegas.Trump, who recently came down with his own bout of COVID-19, did not wear a mask for the indoor service.One of the church's pastors, Denise Goulet, said to Trump from the stage that God had told her he would win the 2020 election. Trump put a handful of 20 dollars bills into an offering bucket and bowed his head during a prayer.Trump will campaign every day leading up to Thursday's debate in Florida, including stops in Arizona and North Carolina, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.While Trump lags in opinion polls at a national level and in many battleground states, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said over the weekend that the national figures are misleading because must-win states are close."We cannot become complacent because the very searing truth is that Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire," she wrote in a memo to donors.U.S. presidential elections are determined by electoral votes, allotted to U.S. states and territories based largely on their populations, rather than by a tally of the popular vote nationwide.Trump campaigned on Saturday in Michigan and Wisconsin, two battleground states he narrowly won in the 2016 election.In Muskegeon, Mich., he attacked Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, for imposing restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus and made light of a right-wing plot uncovered by the FBI to kidnap her."Hopefully you'll be sending her packing pretty soon," Trump said, prompting the crowd to yell back "Lock her up!" several times.Whitmer said on Sunday's "Meet the Press" on NBC that the president's rhetoric was "incredibly disturbing" and "dangerous" for her and her family as well as other politicians whom he targets.(With input from Reuters and AFP)President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden were courting early voters on Sunday in the competitive states of Nevada and North Carolina, as the final presidential debate looms later this week.Both men are working to rouse their political bases and appeal to the seemingly small number of undecided voters in an election that could revolve around voter turnout.One key opportunity comes this week with the candidates' final nationally televised debate, on Thursday evening in Nashville, Tennessee.Some 27.7 million Americans have already cast ballots either by mail or in-person ahead of the November 3 election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.

Similarly, Republican George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000, but the Democrat still lost the election. And Trump could earn a second term as president even if Biden wins the most votes across the country.In a certain sense, the national vote is irrelevant in U.S. presidential elections â all that matters is the Electoral College.How does the Electoral College work?The Electoral College essentially creates 51 mini-elections, with individual contests in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). A total of 538 Electoral College votes (EVs) are split between the states and DC. The EVs are weighted by population and mirror the spread of seats in Congress: 435 representatives, 100 senators plus an additional three votes for DC equals 538.For example, California, the most populous U.S. state, has 53 representatives and two senators â equaling 55 electoral votes. Wyoming, the least populous state, has just one representative and two senators â and so three electoral votes.In all states bar Maine and Nebraska â which award two EVs to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district â the statewide winner takes all the votes.To win the presidency, a candidate must win enough states to pass the magic number of 270 â a majority of EVs.Why are the swing states critical?Strategizing where to campaign â and spend money on advertising and organizing â is vital to reaching 270. Recent history suggests around 37 states plus DC are firmly committed or lean heavily to one party or the other.It's safe to assume, for example, that California's 55 votes will go to Biden, and Wyoming's three will stick with Trump. Overall, there are around 17 states plus DC reliably in the Democratic column and 20 in the Republican column.By this measure, Biden effectively starts the election on 212 votes and Trump on 115. So where can the Democrat win the 58 votes he needs, and where can the Republican find 155?The key to every U.S. presidential election lies in the swing states, the battlegrounds which either party has a chance of winning. These are the states where the candidates will spend heavily on advertising and â pandemic allowing â make numerous campaign visits. In 2020, the key states to watch are Florida (29 EVs), Pennsylvania (20 EVs), North Carolina (15 EVs), Michigan (16 EVs), Wisconsin (10 EVs), and Arizona (11 EVs) though in such an unpredictable year others, such as Minnesota (10 EVs), Georgia (16 EVs) and Texas (38 EVs), could also come into play.How are Biden and Trump aiming to win?A starting point for determining the battlegrounds is to assess the margins of victory in 2016: Trump triumphed over Clinton with victories of less than one percentage point in the Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Those 46 Electoral College votes, won by the narrowest of margins in Midwestern states which hadn't voted Republican in decades, put the Republican in the White House.The president can afford to lose two of the Blue Wall states in 2020 and still narrowly win the Electoral College â so long as he holds on to all the others, he took in 2016 when he won states reflecting 306 Electoral College votes in total.The first and most obvious route to President Biden is for him to hold the states Clinton took in the last election and flip back Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin â that would give him 278, putting him in the White House even if he loses vote-heavy states like Florida.The Trump campaign initially looked to expand its target states to those won narrowly by Clinton in 2016, such as New Hampshire (4 EVs), Minnesota and Nevada (6 EVs) but has since changed strategy to focus on holding Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina.Biden, with a big cash advantage over Trump, could have a unique opportunity in 2020 to make inroads into traditional Republican bastions like Georgia and Texas.How is the winner decided?The winner of the presidency is the candidate with at least 270 EVs, but the process by which the state results are decided could be particularly contentious in 2020, with both parties fielding armies of lawyers in the swing states and rows over ballots likely.The EVs are really votes for individual electors, people chosen by the parties in each state to vote for either Trump or Biden on its behalf. This can create confusion, as constitutionally electors don't have to follow the states' popular votes â as several didn't in 2016 â though most are now compelled to do so by state law..While the winner of the election is traditionally projected on election night, the situation in 2020 is unique â at least half of the votes may be cast by mail or early, a huge increase on past elections â and so unless there is a decisive winner, the final result may not be known for days or weeks after November 3.The official timeline is an afterthought in most years but could be important in this cycle.The 538 electors must cast their votes by December 14, and the electoral votes must be passed to the president of the Senate by December 23. The votes are then passed to the new Congress, which meets in a joint session to count the votes on January 6 before inauguration day on January 20.What happens if there's a tie?The Electoral College system does leave open the potential for a 269-269 tie â in that scenario, the president would be decided by the state delegations in the House of Representatives.Each state would have one vote, irrelevant of their size or number of representatives, so 26 would be the number to hit.Ahead of the 2020 elections, the Republicans marginally control the most state delegations despite the Democrats holding a majority of representatives because smaller states like Wyoming, Alaska, and Montana that have just one representative are in the Republican's hands.In the event of a tie, the vice president would be elected by the Senate via majority vote.Video by Xu Qianyun, Ma Zhiyuan, Zhou Jinxi and Chen HaominScript by John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.The clock is ticking towards election day in the United States, with the eyes of the world on the battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden for the keys to the White House.The winner of the November 3 contest is decided via a system designed to give all 50 states a say, but it can have a curious outcome: the candidate with the most votes doesn't necessarily become president.Democrat Hillary Clinton won three million more votes than Trump in 2016, for example, but she's not in the White House.

He has controversially received the open backing of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Akinci's relationship with Ankara, on the other hand, has come under strain, especially after he described the prospect of the north's annexation by Turkey as "horrible" in February.Turkey has now engaged in a bitter dispute over oil and gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, partly because its claim over the marine resource around TRNC's territory isn't recognized by Greece and Cyprus. Sunday's second-round ballot was triggered after Tatar won 32 percent of the vote on October 11 ahead of Akinci, who garnered almost 30 percent in a field of 11 candidates.But Akinci is in a stronger position in the second round, having won the backing of Tufan Erhurman, a fellow Social Democrat, who came third last time around."The results of the first round tell us this: half of the Turkish Cypriot community defend a federation despite all kinds of pressure," Umut Bozkurt, vice dean and assistant professor at Eastern Mediterranean University, told AFP."This election was dominated more by Turkey-northern Cyprus relations than the Cyprus issue."The first round's results also show that a significant part of the electorate seek to be free of "pressure" from Ankara and to live in a united Cyprus, she added.Don't want to be puppetsIn the days leading up to the vote, Turkish Cypriot Twitter users used the hashtag #BarisCunku, meaning "Peace because" in Turkish.One user calling himself Ahmet Karaca wrote on Thursday, "#PeaceBecause, we don't want to be puppets in our own country, we want to be the actor, the director."When Akinci took office in 2015, he was hailed as the leader best placed to revive peace talks with the Republic of Cyprus.But hopes were dashed in July 2017 after UN-mediated negotiations collapsed in Switzerland, notably over the question of the withdrawal of tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers stationed in the TRNC.The polls come amid an economic crisis, deepened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has largely shuttered the tourism sector and led to the closure of Ercan airport in the north and crossing points to the south.The vote also comes after Turkey on Monday resumed gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, stoking tensions with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus in the south.The European Union has deplored Turkey's deployment of exploration vessels and warned Ankara against further "provocations" while multiple countries have staged military drills in the region in recent months.Earlier in October, Turkish troops angered the Republic of Cyrus and many Turkish Cypriots by reopening public access to the fenced-off disputed seaside town of Varosha for the first time since Turkish forces invaded the north.That move drew EU and UN criticism and sparked demonstrations in the Republic of Cyprus, which exercises its authority over the island's southern two-thirds, separated from the north by a UN-patrolled buffer zone.Turkey has repeatedly said it seeks to defend Turkish and Turkish Cypriots' rights in the eastern Mediterranean against a cabal of nations including Greece and Cyprus.(With input from AFP)Turkish-held northern Cyprus, a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara, votes Sunday for a new leader in a run-off election held amid heightened tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.The presidential vote pits the incumbent and favorite, Mustafa Akinci, 72 â who supports reunification with the majority Greek-speaking EU member the Republic of Cyprus in the south â against the right-wing Turkish nationalist Ersin Tatar.Tatar, 60, who advocates a two-state solution, now holds the title of "prime minister" in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).

There are over 7.3 million Bolivians eligible to vote on Sunday to pick up for new president, vice president, senators, deputies, and others for the period of 2020-2025."They are been expected in the election points where they will be safe. These (election) packages are going to be received in those points, logged and guarded," said Luis Vilca, an official for the Bolivian Electoral Tribunal. The leading contenders for the presidency are former Economy Minister Luis Arce and former President Carlos Mesa, a centrist historian and journalist. To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40 percent of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.The electoral tribunal announced on Saturday that the upcoming elections will be monitored by 213,600 citizen observers. Special election observation missions are also expected from a dozen international organizations, such as the EU, the Organization of American States and the UN, as well as several Bolivian civic organizations. In the days leading up to the vote several international observers had arrived in the Bolivian capital to ensure the execution of fair elections.The vote will be key to the direction of the landlocked country after a ballot last year prompted ousted President Evo Morales' resignation and plunged the Andean country into turmoil. However, it is reported that Bolivians in wealthier areas of the capital city of La Paz have begun stocking up on essential supplies and queuing up to buy gas ahead of the election, fearing a return of deadly clashes.The incumbent president Anez took office in November 2019 after the long-term leftist leader Evo Morales resigned the presidency and went into exile when police and army withdrew their support of him. Anez then announced her job as interim president would be to convoke elections to replace Morales. On that November, Bolivia had seen weeks of protests and turmoil where people claimed fraud over the reelection of Morales, who governed for nearly 14 years.While Morales was barred to participate into the elections for the presidency or the senate followed his ouster, he chose Arce as his stand-in for the Movement To Socialism party. The party's backing depends heavily on working-class and rural voters who remain loyal to Morales.(With input from agencies)Bolivia's electoral authorities on Saturday started delivering the sealed ballots ahead of Sunday's presidential election that will end the interim mandate of President Jeanine Anez.Ballots in Bolivia were guarded by police and army officers, who will remain with the electoral material until Sunday. There are over 7.3 million Bolivians eligible to vote on Sunday to pick up for new president, vice president, senators, deputies, and others for the period of 2020-2025."They are been expected in the election points where they will be safe. These (election) packages are going to be received in those points, logged and guarded," said Luis Vilca, an official for the Bolivian Electoral Tribunal. The leading contenders for the presidency are former Economy Minister Luis Arce and former President Carlos Mesa, a centrist historian and journalist. To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40 percent of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.The electoral tribunal announced on Saturday that the upcoming elections will be monitored by 213,600 citizen observers. Special election observation missions are also expected from a dozen international organizations, such as the EU, the Organization of American States and the UN, as well as several Bolivian civic organizations. In the days leading up to the vote several international observers had arrived in the Bolivian capital to ensure the execution of fair elections.The vote will be key to the direction of the landlocked country after a ballot last year prompted ousted President Evo Morales' resignation and plunged the Andean country into turmoil. However, it is reported that Bolivians in wealthier areas of the capital city of La Paz have begun stocking up on essential supplies and queuing up to buy gas ahead of the election, fearing a return of deadly clashes.The incumbent president Anez took office in November 2019 after the long-term leftist leader Evo Morales resigned the presidency and went into exile when police and army withdrew their support of him. Anez then announced her job as interim president would be to convoke elections to replace Morales.

Period," she said."Vote for your daughter's future," read one message in the sea of signs carried by demonstrators. "Fight like a girl," said another.In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demonstrations were considerably smaller, though protesters still turned out in cities across the country, according to organizers.More than 100,000 people took part in some 430 marches in locations from New York to Los Angeles and Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, organizers said.They urged people worried about in-person participation to join in a "socially distant text-banking telethon" aimed at sending five million messages encouraging people to vote.Marchers also paid tribute to late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg â an icon for women and progressives â while protesting Trump's choice of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace her.Barrett has made no secret of her strong Catholic beliefs, raising concerns that a Supreme Court dominated by conservatives could overturn abortion rights if she is confirmed by the Senate.Trump and his fellow Republicans are seeking to fast-track her nomination before the election, a process that began this week and which has drawn sharp controversy.The protest route in Washington started near the White House before heading to the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court building, where a smaller "I'm With Her" counterprotest â in Barrett's favor â was held.Most marchers in Washington wore face masks to stem the spread of COVID-19, with some dressed as Ginsburg in black robes with white lace collars, and many wore the knitted pink hats made famous by the original march.A number of protesters dressed in red robes and white bonnets, portraying characters forced to bear children in the dystopian novel and television series "The Handmaid's Tale."Signs and banners underscored the broader anti-Trump message: "Trump/Pence: Out Now," read one, while others simply said, "Dump Trump."In New York, around 300 people gathered at Manhattan's Washington Square, many with pink hats and signs supporting Trump's Democratic opponent Joe Biden or honoring Ginsburg. It was one of five separate marches in the city."It's really important to be here and try to encourage people to vote out Trump and his misogynistic policies, especially now, with COVID, when a lot of people are isolated," said Yvonne Shackleton, a 47-year-old working mother from near Albany, about a three-hour drive from New York City.A similar number of people gathered in Brooklyn, Ginsburg's hometown, with one protester's sign reading: "Ruth Sent Us.""I'm out here because it's so important that people vote and I'm telling people to vote blue for Biden and (running mate Kamala) Harris because Trump has been a disaster for our country," said Wendy Sacks, a 67-year-old vintage jewelry seller.Mask-wearing protesters marched in Chicago with the same message, banging drums and chanting for Trump's defeat.Next month's presidential contest was also the focus of a separate New York protest Saturday in which hundreds of demonstrators protested the killings of Black people by police officers.Among those protesting was Tamika Palmer, the mother of Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker killed by officers in March during a raid at her home in Louisville, Kentucky.A grand jury decided last month not to charge any of the police officers involved with her death; instead, one officer was charged with shooting into a neighboring home."People need to get out and vote," Palmer told those at the event.

This is the first time the annual exercise, typically concentrated in the Delta region, will be nationwide, Musa said.The move comes just days after the army said it was ready to step in and restore order, but Musa said in the statement that the exercise "has no relationship with any lawful protest under any guise whatsoever."The army had issued a statement on Wednesday warning what it termed "subversive elements and trouble makers" that it was "ready to fully support the civil authority in whatever capacity to maintain law and order and deal with any situation decisively."The mammoth protests saw people flood to the streets of the biggest city Lagos on Saturday, demanding an end to the Special Anti-Robbery Squad (SARS) police unit and pressing for reforms and accountability.Musa said the army enjoins all law abiding Nigerians to go about their lawful activities unhindered as the exercise has nothing to do with #EndSars protest, but the yearly event will ensure the safety and security of Nigeria and her citizens.Anger over abuses by SARS erupted into widespread demonstrations last week, forcing the government to scrap the unit. Protesters used Twitter and the #EndSars hashtag to spread photos and videos showing alleged police brutality.Nigeria's authorities have set up a new special weapons and tactics (SWAT) unit to replace SARS and pledged to hold officers who have committed abuses accountable.

Iran's Foreign Ministry has declared it as victory of "multilateralism, peace and security," despite Washington's pressure to reimpose sanctions.The arms embargo ends as part of Resolution 2231 of a landmark 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States, which gave Iran relief on sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.It means Iran will be legally able to both buy and sell conventional arms, including small arms, missiles, helicopters and tanks."As of today, all restrictions on the transfer of arms, related activities and financial services to and from The Islamic Republic of Iran, and all prohibitions regarding the entry or transit through territories of the United Nations Member States previously imposed on a number of Iranian citizens and military officials, are all automatically terminated," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said said in a statement on October 18.No special action was necessary from the Iranian side as the embargo lifts automatically if no extension or additional measures are taken by the Security Council, the statement said.Iran also said it was self-reliant in its defense and had no need to go on a weapons buying spree."Iran's defense doctrine is premised on strong reliance on its people and indigenous capabilities ... Unconventional arms, weapons of mass destruction and a buying spree of conventional arms have no place in Iran's defense doctrine," said in the statement.Tehran has made strides in ramping up its local production of conventional weapons and defensive capabilities under the pressure of multilateral sanctions over the past decades.Authorities have said Iran will be ready to sell arms when the embargo ends.In late August, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said it would be a "good idea" to consider purchasing missiles from Iran after rival Colombia said Maduro was looking into this plan.Although Tehran tends to exaggerate its weapons capabilities, concerns remain about its long-range ballistic missile program which contributed to Washington leaving the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.Tensions concerning arms control between Washington and Tehran have soared ever since.Related readings:Timeline: Is the landmark Iran nuclear deal coming to an end?From coup to Soleimani's assassination: Seven decades of US-Iran relations in picturesIn August this year, the Trump administration triggered a process aimed at restoring all UN sanctions, after the UN Security Council rejected a U.S. bid to extend the conventional arms embargo on the country.A month later, the U.S. unilaterally announced reinstating all UN sanctions on Iran that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal, a move which would automatically extend the arms embargo as well.The overwhelming majority of UNSC members rejected the bid, saying it has no legal basis. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also told the council he would not take any action on the U.S. declaration.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned it will have a "decisive response" if the U.S. tries to "bully" other nations into adhering to its reinstatement of sanctions.Last week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said during a news conference in Tehran the arms embargo will end on October 18 despite U.S. efforts to block it.However, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, together known as the E3, wrote a joint statement in July, saying that while E3 will remain committed to fully implement Resolution 2231 of the nuclear deal, they believe lifting of the arms embargo "would have major implications for regional security and stability.""We recall that the EU embargoes on conventional arms exports and missile technology will remain in force until 2023," they said.(With input from agencies)The international conventional arms embargo on Iran, imposed 13 years ago by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), was due to expire on Sunday.

According to the Azeri authorities, 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on September 27, but no military casualties have been released so far.In a televised address to the nation, Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, denounced the missile strike as a war crime and warned the leadership of Armenia that it would face responsibility."Azerbaijan will give its response and it will do so exclusively on the battlefield," Aliyev said.The Armenian Defense Ministry denied launching the Saturday strike, but the separatist officials in Nagorno-Karabakh put out a statement listing alleged "legitimate" military facilities in the city of Ganja, although they stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, came under intense shelling on Saturday, leaving three civilians wounded, according to the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities.The Azerbaijani military declared Saturday that they downed an Armenian Su-25 jet, a claim quickly dismissed by Armenia's Defense Ministry. Drones and rocket systems supplied by Turkey have given the Azerbaijani military an edge on the battlefield, helping them outgun the Armenian forces that rely mostly on outdated Soviet-era weapons.The Armenian military said they downed three Azerbaijani drones over the territory of Armenia on Saturday. Azerbaijan denied that.Armenia speaks to Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh's behalf as Baku refuses to negotiate with the separatist authorities. Yerevan says its own forces are not involved in the conflict and have not attacked Azerbaijan.

According to the Azeri authorities, 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on September 27, but no military casualties have been released so far.In a televised address to the nation, Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, denounced the missile strike as a war crime and warned the leadership of Armenia that it would face responsibility."Azerbaijan will give its response and it will do so exclusively on the battlefield," Aliyev said.The Armenian Defense Ministry denied launching the Saturday strike, but the separatist officials in Nagorno-Karabakh put out a statement listing alleged "legitimate" military facilities in the city of Ganja, although they stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, came under intense shelling on Saturday, leaving three civilians wounded, according to the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities.The Azerbaijani military declared Saturday that they downed an Armenian Su-25 jet, a claim quickly dismissed by Armenia's Defense Ministry. Drones and rocket systems supplied by Turkey have given the Azerbaijani military an edge on the battlefield, helping them outgun the Armenian forces that rely mostly on outdated Soviet-era weapons.The Armenian military said they downed three Azerbaijani drones over the territory of Armenia on Saturday.

It will go into effect on June 1, 2021.According to experts, the current existing law faces severe challenges due to the emergence of fresh social problems. For example, in some cases, the minors' guardians themselves are the domestic violence abusers; school bullying is frequent but often covered; numerous minors are addicted to online games and sexual abuses against minors are often conducted by people in close contact with the victims, like teachers, neighbors and relatives.As a response to theose problems, the revised law has formulated and improved related protective measures, clearly stipulated the responsibilities of parents, schools, society, government and judicial organs in safeguarding the well-being of minors.In terms of internet use by minors, the law highlighted that producers and sellers of network products should install online software for protecting minors or offer a clear information on how to install such a software.And they should also remind minors to protect their personal information and impose protective restrictions on minors' use of their personal information online. Without the consent of parents or other guardians, they're forbidden to collect, store and use minors' personal information.Besides, the new law urges schools to establish a mechanism to prevent school bullying, and provide training for faculties, staff and students in stopping school bullying. Schools and parents are also asked to provide psychological counseling and support to prevent psychological trauma of minors.Moreover, the law emphasized the importance of sex education and self-protection awareness of minors, asking related departments and organizations to conduct sex education that is appropriate for the minor's age.At the same time, the law introduced new job rules to further prevent child sex abuse, requiring kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and certification bodies that grant teacher qualifications must check the legal record of the job seekers and teaching candidates to exclude and disqualify those who have been charged with or convicted of child molestation or sexual abuses.China's freshly revised Law on the Protection of Minors was adopted with a vote at the 22nd Session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress on Saturday.The revised law, introduced in 1991 and revised in 2006, has significantly increased the number of articles from 72 to 130, adding two new chapters involved government protection and online protection for minors.The new law includes general provisions and protections for the areas of family, school, society, Internet, government, judiciary as well as legal responsibility and supplementary provisions.

Trump's wife and son have already recovered from the infection."Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms," Melania Trump said in a statement. She said she and Barron had since tested negative for the virus.Trump told a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, that Barron "is just fine now" and said it was an example of why schools should reopen."I don't even think he knew he had it, because they're young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off," Trump said. "Get the kids back to school," he said.The newspaper reported that officials in the administration have hoped Trump could use his own infection experience to relate it to the U.S. public, especially those who have suffered from the pandemic, as well as provide some basic health guidelines."He looks completely out of touch," Mike DuHaime, a Republican consultant close to former New Jersey governor Chris Christie who were infected with the virus, told the publication. "He doesn't appreciate what it would be like for a regular person. He gets the best medical treatment of everyone in the world and is acting like he's Superman. It really reinforces a lot of negative notions about him and how he handled coronavirus from the beginning."But the White House said that the president is just sending a message "of strength and optimism.""Any suggestion that the President of the United States has not taken the threat of COVID-19 seriously is completely false," White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. "As the entire country has confronted COVID-19, President Trump has never wavered in his message of strength and optimism to the American people, and as he personally defeated the virus the President has once again reminded the nation that he is a fighter and that if we all fight together we will defeat this."(With input from Reuters)The President of the United States Donald Trump is using his own recovery from COVID-19 infections to give an impression that the pandemic is going away and push for a return of society back to normalcy, according to the Washington Post, citing current and former administration officials.The article published on Friday said that despite the outbreak that has affected Trump's family members and top aides, the president and his administration are still downplaying the virus, saying that the country is "turning the corner."First Lady Melania Trump, their son Barron Trump and dozens of White House officials have contracted COVID-19.

She said she and Barron had since tested negative for the virus.Trump told a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, that Barron "is just fine now" and said it was an example of why schools should reopen."I don't even think he knew he had it, because they're young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off," Trump said. "Get the kids back to school," he said.The newspaper reported that officials in the administration have hoped Trump could use his own infection experience to relate it to the U.S. public, especially those who have suffered from the pandemic, as well as provide some basic health guidelines."He looks completely out of touch," Mike DuHaime, a Republican consultant close to former New Jersey governor Chris Christie who were infected with the virus, told the publication. "He doesn't appreciate what it would be like for a regular person. He gets the best medical treatment of everyone in the world and is acting like he's Superman. It really reinforces a lot of negative notions about him and how he handled coronavirus from the beginning."But the White House said that the president is just sending a message "of strength and optimism.""Any suggestion that the President of the United States has not taken the threat of COVID-19 seriously is completely false," White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement. "As the entire country has confronted COVID-19, President Trump has never wavered in his message of strength and optimism to the American people, and as he personally defeated the virus the President has once again reminded the nation that he is a fighter and that if we all fight together we will defeat this."(With input from Reuters)Chinese President Xi Jinping has underscored the perseverance and determination of the nation to win the battle against poverty.Party committees and governments at all levels must maintain the momentum of fighting poverty and never stop until they have won a complete victory, Xi stressed in a directive issued as the country observes its seventh National Poverty Relief Day, which falls on October 17.Read more:Graphics: President Xi Jinping's words on poverty alleviationGraphics: Ending China's poverty by 20207 months left, how can all Chinese counties shake off poverty?The year 2020 marks the concluding phase for China's endeavor to build a moderately prosperous society in all respects and to win the battle against poverty, the Chinese president noted.Facing the dual challenges of COVID-19 and floods, China is still determined to accomplish the tasks for winning the battle against poverty this year, he said. Describing the country's poverty alleviation achievements as "decisive," Xi urged all parties to achieve the intended goals as planned in the final stage of the tough battle. He pointed out that all regions and departments should sum up their experience in poverty eradication and give full play to their institutional advantages."We should continue to promote both poverty alleviation and rural revitalization in an all-out effort," Xi said, adding that the country should keep poverty alleviation policies stable. Stressing multiple measures to consolidate achievements, Xi called for enhancing the development capacity of the low-income population in underdeveloped and rural areas, encouraging low-income population with the capacity to achieve prosperity through hard-work and facilitating the gradual realization of common prosperity. The poverty alleviation goal should be fulfilled on time with maximum effort and high quality, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said in his instruction on poverty.He urged to speed up efforts to lift the remaining impoverished counties out of poverty, develop industries with local features to grow incomes for farmers, stabilize poor population' employment and provide relocated residents with follow-up support."Once the risk of returning to poverty is discovered, assistance should be undertaken at once," Li added.The instructions were delivered at a national teleconference on Saturday, at which China honored individuals and institutions with a national award for their outstanding work in poverty alleviation. Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, met the awardees in Beijing on Saturday.Wang congratulated the award-winning workers and lauded the people battling poverty on China's front lines.

recent diplomatic interactions with Southeast Asian countries have enhanced unity between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and deepened the cooperation of regional anti-pandemic fight, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Friday.He made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua after holding talks last week with Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesian president's special envoy, and Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and wrapped up Friday his Southeast Asia tour, which has taken him to Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand and Singapore.This is Wang's first tour to Southeast Asian countries in the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.Strengthen unityThe Chinese foreign minister believes that his visit has first of all enhanced the unity between China and the ASEAN."We have exchanged views and reached a series of consensus on major issues, such as jointly responding to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving international situation, deepening bilateral relations, maintaining regional peace and stability, and improving the global governance system," Wang said.He noted that all parties should further enhance mutual trust and solidarity, and continue to push forward the development of relations between China and ASEAN countries, so as to bring them to higher levels.Deepen cooperationFurthermore, cooperation on the fight against the pandemic has been deepened, Wang said.It is agreed that East Asia has made outstanding achievements in combating against COVID-19, which comes from countries' commitment to putting the people first, taking scientific epidemic prevention measures, sticking together and providing mutual assistance and support, Wang said.All parties should improve the level of joint prevention and control against the pandemic, enhance the exchange of prevention and treatment experience, and strengthen cooperation in vaccine research and development, production and use, he added.China, Wang said, will continue to help ASEAN countries to prevail over the pandemic, including providing necessary anti-epidemic materials, carrying out cooperation on vaccine, assisting the establishment of nucleic acid testing laboratories, supporting ASEAN in launching an anti-epidemic fund, and establishing repositories for emergency medical supplies.According to Wang, the Southeast countries have spoken highly of China's vaccine research and development and expressed the hope to conduct all-dimension cooperation with China in vaccine research and development, purchase, production and use.On the issue concerning the life and health of all mankind, the international community should cooperate with each other, he said, adding "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the necessary conditions for global vaccine development.China has made it clear that it is willing to make efforts within its capacity in vaccine development, and give priority to the needs of developing countries including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, he added.Promote economic recoveryThirdly, the economic recovery in post-pandemic era was promoted, Wang noted."All parties have spoken highly of China's major anti-epidemic achievements and its progress in the resumption of work and production, and they look forward to and believe that China will continue to be the main engine driving global economic recovery," Wang said.They all hope to take the opportunity of China's "dual circulation" development pattern and dock China's Belt and Road Initiative with their own countries' development strategies, so as to embark on the fast track of post-pandemic economic recovery as soon as possible, he said.Enhance regional peace and stabilityThe fourth is that the visits have strengthened regional peace and stability, said Wang.In the face of foreign forces stirring up trouble and creating tension in the South China Sea, Wang noted that the Chinese side has emphasized that the South China Sea should not become a sea for great powers to play games or for gunboats to overrun, which is generally recognized by all parties.The countries agreed to resolve differences through friendly consultation, fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea as well as endeavor for an early conclusion of a more binding and effective Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region, he added.Safeguard international equityFifth, the visits have safeguarded international equity and justice, Wang said.He said that the countries have expressed the need to oppose power politics and unilateral bullying, uphold the basic norms of international relations, firmly practice the concepts of multilateralism and win-win cooperation, and make joint efforts to promote democratization of international relations and multi-polarization of the world.Access to COVID-19 vaccineWang also reiterated China's willingness to make efforts within its capacity in vaccine development, and give priority to the needs of developing countries including the ASEAN countries.Speaking on how China will fulfill its commitment to make vaccines a global public good, Wang said that the virus knows no borders, and only when all countries get rid of the epidemic can the global fight against the COVID-19 be a final victory.Vaccines are the "ultimate weapon" to prevail over the epidemic, he said, calling on international community to working jointly on issues concerning the life and health of all mankind. "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the necessary conditions for global vaccine development.China will earnestly fulfill its commitment to make vaccines a global public product once they are successfully developed and put into use, and will contribute to the accessibility and affordability of the vaccines in developing countries, Wang pledged.'Dual circulation'Wang noted that a new economic development pattern featuring "dual circulation," in which domestic and overseas markets complement and reinforce each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay, has been a major strategic deployment by the Chinese government."China will promote high-quality development and build a new system of an open economy of a higher level," Wang said. "The scale of the domestic market will be further expanded. The combination of the domestic and international markets will be closer. There will be more room for cooperation between countries and China."ASEAN countries are in the best position to draw momentum from China's new development pattern and seize the opportunity, Wang noted, adding that they are also in the best position to expand mutual benefit and achieve economic recovery and better development with China.China's huge market size will first benefit its neighbors, providing ASEAN countries with a broader export market, said the Chinese minister.China is ready to work with ASEAN countries to implement an upgraded China-ASEAN Free Trade Area protocol and sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership within this year, continue to make the China International Import Expo and the China-ASEAN Expo a success, and import more products needed by the Chinese market from ASEAN countries, Wang said.(With input from Xinhua)The recent diplomatic interactions with Southeast Asian countries have enhanced unity between China and the Association of

Chinese President Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.China's economy faces challenges as the world is undergoing profound changes, the meeting said. As a significant part of the "dual circulation" strategy, the Chengdu-Chongqing economic rim will bring high-quality growth for the region, widen the market and stabilize the production chain and supply chain.The economic rim aims to make the two megacities important growth engines, innovation hubs, and desirable cities to live for the vast regions in western China, it said.The plan also asks Chengdu and Chongqing to play a leading role in China's Belt and Road Initiative and promote economic connectivity with regional countries.But the meeting didn't release a roadmap for the implementation of the strategy. 'Dual circulation' modelPresident Xi first raised the idea of "dual circulation" in May and later elaborated that China will rely mainly on "internal circulation" - the domestic cycle of production, distribution, and consumption - for its development, supported by innovation and upgrades of the economy.Xi also said "internal circulation" will be supported by "external circulation"."Dual circulation" is by no means a closed domestic loop, Xi has emphasized on different occasions, reaffirming that opening-up was a fundamental national policy.Speaking to local people during his recent inspection in Guangdong Province, Xi said he was there to send a clear message that China will continue to walk down the road of reform and opening-up. China must adhere to the opening-up policy in an all-round way and enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going global," Xi reasserted at the event marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ).Chengdu, located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, is known for its China Panda Base. It has a population of 16.3 million.In recent years, the city is prioritizing environmental protection, public space and quality of life as the agenda while seeking to protect it from the kind of urbanization and development that has stripped its character.With a 2,000-year history, Chengdu, also an early center of Taoism, is known for preserving Chinese traditions in a way other urban centers don't have.People in Panda City spend more as sun sets The city is also an important gateway to the west. It is connected to 55 overseas cities and 16 Chinese cities through the China-Europe freight trains.Since its launch in 2013, Chengdu has seen more than 6,000 accumulative trips, according to the administrative committee of the Chengdu International Railway Port.Goods transported through the freight trains are worth nearly 200 billion yuan (about $29 billion), it said.The China-Europe freight train service is one of the major routes within the the Belt and Road Initiative.Chongqing was separated from Sichuan and became China's fourth municipality under the direct jurisdiction of the central government in 1997.The municipality, with a population of over 30 million, is one of China's fastest-growing cities. Guardian once described it as the "invisible" city and the city hidden in the fog.In 2019, both cities ranked ranked among the top 10 for total GDP among Chinese cities. According to government papers, the Chengdu-Chongqing city cluster consists of 42 cities, districts, and counties in Sichuan and Chongqing, covering 185,000 square kilometers and nearly 100 million people.Official data showed that the city cluster's overall economy has increased from 3.76 trillion yuan ($547 billion) in 2014 to nearly 6 trillion yuan in 2018.(Cover: Chengdu opens panda-themed train, a tourist line taking people to see its old towns and modern infrastructure in 2018.

Has the trajectory of campaign changed over the last week?The national pictureThe national polls have heavily favored Biden in the fallout period from the first presidential debate and Trump testing positive for COVID-19, and that trend has continued over the past seven days with the Democrat hitting the 50-percent mark for the first time in CGTN's analysis of publicly-available opinion polls.Biden stretched his lead over Trump from 8.3 points to 8.6 over the week, leaving him in a strong position and suggesting the president will need everything to go right in the swing states if he is to have a chance of re-election â and will have to make the second presidential debate, scheduled for October 22, count. High-quality individual national polls in recent days have consistently indicated Biden holds a double-digit lead, with YouGov, Reuters, NBC and NPR surveys suggesting Trump is down by at least 10 points.In the generic ballot, a measure of which party voters intend to back in congressional elections in November, Democrats are leading the Republicans by 7 points in the RealClearPolitics average, up from 6.6 a week earlier. While the Democrats appear likely to retain control of the House of Representatives, the battle for an all-important majority in the Senate remains neck and neck.The states that matterThe extent of Biden's national polling lead suggests he's almost certain to win the popular vote, just as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, but it's the individual states that matter in the Electoral College system.CGTN analysis of state polling indicates the Democrat has an advantage over Trump in many of the battlegrounds, though the margins are smaller than his national lead.Both Biden and Trump again campaigned in the pivotal state of Florida â now the president's home state â over the past week, and polling suggests the fight for its 29 electoral votes is narrowing: the Democrat has a 3.2-point lead, down from 3.4 points seven days ago.Trump held a televised town hall in Miami on Thursday following the cancellation of the second debate, as Biden took part in a similar event at the same time from Pennsylvania, the Midwestern state that the Republican is currently putting the most resources towards keeping in his column.Winning the Blue Wall of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin pushed Trump over the edge in 2016, but his campaign has diverted cash away from the latter two states over the past two weeks. Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes, is shaping up to be crucial: Biden holds a 6.2-point lead in the state of his birth, according to the polling averages, down from 6.3 a week ago.Polls only provide a snapshot in time and have a margin of error, but the state-by-state surveys suggest if the election were held today Biden could be on course to win 355 Electoral College votes to Trump's 183, unchanged since last week.Twitter rowsCGTN is using exclusive AI technology to weigh sentiment towards tweets related to the election, updating every 24 hours to reflect whether comments about Trump and Biden are positive, negative or neutral.Sentiment towards the candidates followed a familiar pattern over the past seven days, with tweets related to Trump a net negative 4.2 by daily average and tweets related to Biden net positive 7.9. Twitter itself was at the center of two election-related storms over the past week, suspending fake accounts claiming to be run by Black supporters of Trump only after being alerted to the issue by a newspaper investigation and then blocking an unsubstantiated New York Post article about Hunter Biden, the son of the Democratic nominee. The decision to block the URL of the Biden article and lock the account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, after she posted the link, led to uproar from Republicans.Money talksIn the money stakes, the two candidates are on very different tracks in the final stretch of the election.The Biden campaign and its affiliated committees set a new monthly fundraising record by hauling in $383 million in September, a huge $135.2 million more than Trump and his affiliates' $247.8 million.The Democrat's big cash advantage in the closing stages of the race is already evident in how the campaigns are spending their money.Trump, with $251.4 million on hand at the start of October, according to his campaign, cancelled ad buys in Midwestern states he probably needs to win and diverted cash to Sunbelt states that he simply cannot afford to lose.Biden, with $432 million in reserve, expanded his spending into traditionally Republican states including Texas, where polling suggests he only narrowly trails the president. The combination of polling numbers and cash on hand favoring the Democrat mean that with a little more than two weeks to go, the Trump campaign is on the defensive while Biden is in a strong position to attack as the campaigns head towards Thursday's final debate. (Graphics by Li Yueyun)Scan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.Joe Biden and Donald Trump resumed something like a traditional presidential campaign over the past seven days with the clock ticking ever closer to the November 3 election day in the United States.The Democrat and Republican candidates crisscrossed the country to meet voters and win airtime, with the former vice president using his cash advantage â after another record-breaking fundraising month in September â to expand his ad buys and put the president's campaign on the back foot in Texas, North Carolina, Iowa and Georgia, all states Trump won comfortably in 2016.CGTN's interactive page offers in-depth analysis of the 2020 election, with exclusive data covering national and state-by-state polling, online sentiment and fundraising.

Zhao warned. China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward and the development of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) will never pause, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed on Friday.In an article titled "Two Decades of a Shared Journey toward New Heights in the New Era" to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese foreign minister called for increasing cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, and achieving greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.According to Wang, in the last 20 years, the FOCAC has witnessed the consolidation of the political foundation of both sides, fruitful practical cooperation results, increased people-to-people exchange and strengthened mutual support.He said the FOCAC is a source of inspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations as the two sides have always pursued solidarity, consultation, and cooperation, advanced win-win cooperation for development, supported each other in trying times and embraced openness and inclusiveness.Looking into the future, Wang said China and Africa should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for the mankind, set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation and unleash a greater potential in practical cooperation.Here is the full text of Wang's article:This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). On October 12, President Xi Jinping and President Macky Sall of Senegal, the current African Co-Chair of the FOCAC, issued a joint congratulatory message to mark this important occasion. Embracing the dawn of the new century and the trend of peace and development 20 years ago, China and our brothers in Africa decided to initiate the FOCAC to promote win-win cooperation. Since then, the family of China and African nations has had its own platform for collective dialogue and mechanism for practical cooperation, ushering in a brand new chapter in China-Africa relations.IThe past 20 years have been a journey of productive cooperation. The FOCAC has bolstered high-level interactions and political trust between China and Africa, delivering a leap in China-Africa relations from "a new type of partnership" to "a new type of strategic partnership" and to "a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership."China-Africa cooperation has made impressive achievements. In 2019, direct Chinese investment stock in Africa topped $49.1 billion, up by nearly 100 times from the year 2000; China-Africa trade reached $208.7 billion, 20 times the size of 2000. China has been Africa's largest trading partner for 11 years in a row, and has contributed more than 20 percent to Africa's growth for a number of years. Many flagship projects, such as the African Union (AU) Conference Center, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, and the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, among many others, have been completed and put into use. Cooperation in other fields, ranging from science, education, culture and health to people-to-people exchange, peace and security, has also made significant headway.Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), President Xi Jinping has set great store by China's relations with Africa. He personally laid down principles guiding China's Africa policy, including sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and pursuing the greater good and shared interests, and called for building a stronger China-Africa community with a shared future. His devotion to leadership diplomacy with Africa has given a strong boost to the relations between the two sides.The political foundation has been cemented. In 2013, President Xi Jinping chose Africa as the destination of his first overseas visit as the Head of State of China. So far, he has visited Africa four times, covering all sub-regions of the continent. In 2015 and 2018, Chinese and African leaders convened two historic FOCAC summits: one in Johannesburg and another in Beijing. In June this year, the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19 was held at a critical moment in tackling the coronavirus. Political interactions between the two sides are more frequent, extensive and unprecedented in scale. For example, on the sidelines of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, President Xi Jinping attended more than 70 bilateral and multilateral events in eight days. With the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Gambia, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, and Burkina Faso, the China-Africa family has been further expanded.Practical cooperation has been fruitful. China-Africa economic and trade cooperation has been growing at a higher speed, demonstrating three encouraging shifts: from government-driven to market-driven, from trade in goods to industrial cooperation, and from engineering contracts to investment and operations. Together, the two sides have drafted and implemented 10 cooperation plans and eight major initiatives, taking practical cooperation to a new level. China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation is progressing with a strong momentum: 44 African countries and the AU Commission have signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, and a host of projects such as railways, roads, airports, ports and power stations have come to fruition, enabling remarkable change in Africa's economic and social development.People-to-people exchanges have been thriving. Events across a diverse range of areas, including the China-Africa Youth Festival, the Think Tank Forum, the Joint Research and Exchange Program, the Poverty Reduction and Development Conference, and the China-Africa Press Center, have been successful. And the China-Africa Institute has been inaugurated. So far, China has provided about 120,000 government scholarships to African countries, set up 61 Confucius Institutes and 44 Confucius Classrooms in collaboration with 46 African countries, sent 21,000 doctors and nurses in medical teams to 48 African countries, treating around 220 million African patients, and forged 150 pairs of sister cities. All these efforts have consolidated popular support for China-Africa friendship.Mutual support has been further strengthened. China and Africa fought side by side against both Ebola and COVID-19. The two sides have supported each other on issues of each other's core interests and major concerns. China-Africa peace and security cooperation has been enhanced. The two sides have jointly supported multilateralism, opposed unilateralism and protectionism, safeguarded the international order and international system with the United Nations at the core, and promoted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other basic norms governing international relations. Such collaboration has effectively upheld the shared interests of developing countries as well as the overall interests of the whole international community.IIThe past 20 years have been a journey of overcoming challenges and enhancing partnerships. The FOCAC has withstood the test of the volatile international landscape, and scored historic achievements. It is a vivid epitome of China's pioneering efforts in foreign affairs under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. It is also a source of aspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations.We have always pursued solidarity, consultation and cooperation. China is the largest developing country and the African continent home to the largest number of developing countries. When China-Africa cooperation prospers, South-South cooperation will prosper. When the voice of the 2.6 billion people in China and Africa are heeded and respected, the world will have genuine fairness and justice.From the very beginning, we have always taken China-Africa relations as part of South-South cooperation, and have advanced the FOCAC in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. The FOCAC, composed of China and 53 African countries and the AU, is by no means "one vs. 54", but "54 plus one". We would sit down in consultation whenever there is an issue, and solve it through discussion. And that is the guiding principle for our conduct. China has never interfered in African countries' pursuit of development paths that suit their own national conditions, never imposed its will upon others, never attached any political strings to its assistance, and never sought selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation.We have attached great importance to the Forum's role in drafting overall plans and providing strategic guidance, and we have paid equal attention to China's ties with each FOCAC member, so that the Forum mechanism and bilateral cooperation can complement each other in forging a strong network of partnerships between and among countries. The Forum has significantly increased the international profile of China-Africa relations, and has become a pacesetter for South-South cooperation and cooperation by the international community with Africa.We have always advanced win-win cooperation for development. Both China and Africa are at a crucial stage of development and rejuvenation. The Chinese and African peoples are entitled to live a better life. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that no one could hold back the Chinese people or the African people as we march toward rejuvenation. Cooperation and development have always been FOCAC's top priority. We have fully leveraged our unique strengths, such as the great complementarity between our economies and development stages. We have developed greater synergy between our development strategies and embarked on a path of win-win cooperation with distinctive features.Our cooperation is about action and results. Every three years, the FOCAC rolls out a package action plan. The 2018 Beijing Summit alone produced more than 880 deliverables. We always deliver and we do not make empty promises. We have kept pace with the times and kept our mind open to break new ground and tide over challenging times. According to African friends, the FOCAC is a cooperation mechanism that truly delivers.We have always supported each other in trying times. China-Africa friendship was born in the formidable years of national liberation and is deeply rooted in our peoples' heart. As President Xi said, China and Africa are friends tested by adversity, and such friends must never be forgotten.During the 2008 international financial crisis, China and Africa rendered each other valuable support. Instead of reducing assistance, China bucked the trend and increased its support to Africa. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, when others chose to leave, Chinese doctors and nurses braved their lives and rushed to the hard-hit regions to help local people fight the disease, writing an indelible chapter in the history of humanitarian assistance of the People's Republic of China. Faced with the onslaught of COVID-19 worldwide, China and Africa have again stood shoulder to shoulder to help each other.What we have gone through together shows that China and Africa are more than just partners. We are comrades-in-arms. The more severe the difficulties, the more determined and confident we are about China-Africa cooperation, and the more capable the FOCAC is in pooling our strengths to forge ahead, making itself the key driving force for the time-honored China-Africa friendship.We have always embraced openness and inclusiveness. The FOCAC was established to answer the call of the times for peace, development and win-win cooperation. It serves as a fine example of multilateralism. China and Africa have all along upheld the principle of openness and inclusiveness. A closed-door policy or exclusiveness is never an option. Colonial plunder and the Cold-War rivalry brought excruciating sufferings to the African people. That part of history must not be repeated. Africa must never again be an arena for major-power rivalry. This belief is widely shared by people across Africa, and should be respected by the entire international community.Openness is vital in cooperation with Africa. It is important to share experience and learn from one another, so that Africa's peace and development can benefit from the common effort and contribution of the international community. Africa's cooperation with China has improved its development capacity and business environment, which in turn has created favorable conditions for other countries' cooperation with the continent. China has taken part in more Africa-related trilateral and multilateral cooperation in recent years. We commend and encourage such cooperation and will continue our support.IIIThe past 20 years have been a journey of China and Africa coming together as one community with a shared future. Today, the world is being shaped by changes unseen in a century, a process accelerated by COVID-19. China and Africa are good friends, partners and brothers, and more importantly, an important force for world peace and development. In this changing world, China and Africa need to stay united and work more closely together to make the FOCAC a greater success and further strengthen China-Africa relations, so as to further enhance our friendship and justice in the world.China and Africa can and should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind. The more complex and fluid the international landscape is, the greater the imperative for China and Africa to adhere to the fundamental direction of building a China-Africa community with a shared future. We should continue to follow the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith as well as the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. We need to maintain the momentum of high-level exchange, share more governance experience with each other, build a stronger bond between the Chinese and African peoples, and continue to elevate the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. We need to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, step up mutual support on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and work together for greater democracy in international relations. We need to take the side of the overwhelming majority of the international community, stay committed to multilateralism, and align global governance reforms with the common interests of developing countries. With these efforts, we will make the China-Africa relationship a trailblazer and a shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind.China and Africa can and should set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation. China and Africa have fought hard for what we have achieved in tackling COVID-19. As the virus continues to spread globally, both China and Africa are confronted with the formidable task of combating the virus while stabilizing the economy and protecting people's livelihoods. We will speed up the implementation of the important measures that President Xi Jinping announced at the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, and make China's contribution to making vaccines accessible and affordable for African countries as soon as possible. China will continue to provide COVID-19 containment supplies, send expert teams, and facilitate Africa's procurement of medical supplies from China. China will strive for breaking ground for the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters by the end of this year. These are concrete actions that will show the world that China and Africa have the determination and strength to defeat COVID-19 together.China and Africa can and should unleash greater potential in practical cooperation. COVID-19 will not hamper China-Africa cooperation. As one of the first countries to fully reopen the economy, China aims to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will bring new opportunities for China and Africa to deepen, transform and upgrade their cooperation. China supports Africa's effort to develop the African Continental Free Trade Area. We encourage Chinese companies and financial institutions to take an active part in infrastructure connectivity projects in Africa, which will facilitate cross-border logistics and customs clearance. We are ready to work with the international community in supporting Africa's integration process and sub-regional economic community-building. China hopes to work with Africa to deepen the integration of our industrial and supply chains, and encourages Chinese businesses to invest and conduct technological cooperation in Africa. We will support Africa's agricultural modernization and industrialization drive to raise the added value and competitiveness of Africa's exported energy, mineral and agricultural products. China will work with the international community to support Africa's integration into the global industrial and supply chains. China and Africa should to join hands in pursuing green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. This will contribute to African countries' ability to tackle climate change.As an ancient Chinese saying goes: "Having scaled a cloud-shrouded mountain peak, we rest our horses and set sail for the vast ocean." The China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward. The development of the FOCAC will never take a break. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will continue to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and, with the personal commitment and support of Chinese and African leaders, increase the cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, tighten China-Africa ties against all odds, and achieve greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward and the development of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) will never pause, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed on Friday.In an article titled "Two Decades of a Shared Journey toward New Heights in the New Era" to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese foreign minister called for increasing cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, and achieving greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.According to Wang, in the last 20 years, the FOCAC has witnessed the consolidation of the political foundation of both sides, fruitful practical cooperation results, increased people-to-people exchange and strengthened mutual support.He said the FOCAC is a source of inspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations as the two sides have always pursued solidarity, consultation, and cooperation, advanced win-win cooperation for development, supported each other in trying times and embraced openness and inclusiveness.Looking into the future, Wang said China and Africa should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for the mankind, set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation and unleash a greater potential in practical cooperation.Here is the full text of Wang's article:This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC).

Together, the two sides have drafted and implemented 10 cooperation plans and eight major initiatives, taking practical cooperation to a new level. China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation is progressing with a strong momentum: 44 African countries and the AU Commission have signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, and a host of projects such as railways, roads, airports, ports and power stations have come to fruition, enabling remarkable change in Africa's economic and social development.People-to-people exchanges have been thriving. Events across a diverse range of areas, including the China-Africa Youth Festival, the Think Tank Forum, the Joint Research and Exchange Program, the Poverty Reduction and Development Conference, and the China-Africa Press Center, have been successful. And the China-Africa Institute has been inaugurated. So far, China has provided about 120,000 government scholarships to African countries, set up 61 Confucius Institutes and 44 Confucius Classrooms in collaboration with 46 African countries, sent 21,000 doctors and nurses in medical teams to 48 African countries, treating around 220 million African patients, and forged 150 pairs of sister cities. All these efforts have consolidated popular support for China-Africa friendship.Mutual support has been further strengthened. China and Africa fought side by side against both Ebola and COVID-19. The two sides have supported each other on issues of each other's core interests and major concerns. China-Africa peace and security cooperation has been enhanced. The two sides have jointly supported multilateralism, opposed unilateralism and protectionism, safeguarded the international order and international system with the United Nations at the core, and promoted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other basic norms governing international relations. Such collaboration has effectively upheld the shared interests of developing countries as well as the overall interests of the whole international community.IIThe past 20 years have been a journey of overcoming challenges and enhancing partnerships. The FOCAC has withstood the test of the volatile international landscape, and scored historic achievements. It is a vivid epitome of China's pioneering efforts in foreign affairs under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. It is also a source of aspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations.We have always pursued solidarity, consultation and cooperation. China is the largest developing country and the African continent home to the largest number of developing countries. When China-Africa cooperation prospers, South-South cooperation will prosper. When the voice of the 2.6 billion people in China and Africa are heeded and respected, the world will have genuine fairness and justice.From the very beginning, we have always taken China-Africa relations as part of South-South cooperation, and have advanced the FOCAC in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. The FOCAC, composed of China and 53 African countries and the AU, is by no means "one vs. 54", but "54 plus one". We would sit down in consultation whenever there is an issue, and solve it through discussion. And that is the guiding principle for our conduct. China has never interfered in African countries' pursuit of development paths that suit their own national conditions, never imposed its will upon others, never attached any political strings to its assistance, and never sought selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation.We have attached great importance to the Forum's role in drafting overall plans and providing strategic guidance, and we have paid equal attention to China's ties with each FOCAC member, so that the Forum mechanism and bilateral cooperation can complement each other in forging a strong network of partnerships between and among countries. The Forum has significantly increased the international profile of China-Africa relations, and has become a pacesetter for South-South cooperation and cooperation by the international community with Africa.We have always advanced win-win cooperation for development. Both China and Africa are at a crucial stage of development and rejuvenation. The Chinese and African peoples are entitled to live a better life. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that no one could hold back the Chinese people or the African people as we march toward rejuvenation. Cooperation and development have always been FOCAC's top priority. We have fully leveraged our unique strengths, such as the great complementarity between our economies and development stages. We have developed greater synergy between our development strategies and embarked on a path of win-win cooperation with distinctive features.Our cooperation is about action and results. Every three years, the FOCAC rolls out a package action plan. The 2018 Beijing Summit alone produced more than 880 deliverables. We always deliver and we do not make empty promises. We have kept pace with the times and kept our mind open to break new ground and tide over challenging times. According to African friends, the FOCAC is a cooperation mechanism that truly delivers.We have always supported each other in trying times. China-Africa friendship was born in the formidable years of national liberation and is deeply rooted in our peoples' heart. As President Xi said, China and Africa are friends tested by adversity, and such friends must never be forgotten.During the 2008 international financial crisis, China and Africa rendered each other valuable support. Instead of reducing assistance, China bucked the trend and increased its support to Africa. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, when others chose to leave, Chinese doctors and nurses braved their lives and rushed to the hard-hit regions to help local people fight the disease, writing an indelible chapter in the history of humanitarian assistance of the People's Republic of China. Faced with the onslaught of COVID-19 worldwide, China and Africa have again stood shoulder to shoulder to help each other.What we have gone through together shows that China and Africa are more than just partners. We are comrades-in-arms. The more severe the difficulties, the more determined and confident we are about China-Africa cooperation, and the more capable the FOCAC is in pooling our strengths to forge ahead, making itself the key driving force for the time-honored China-Africa friendship.We have always embraced openness and inclusiveness. The FOCAC was established to answer the call of the times for peace, development and win-win cooperation. It serves as a fine example of multilateralism. China and Africa have all along upheld the principle of openness and inclusiveness. A closed-door policy or exclusiveness is never an option. Colonial plunder and the Cold-War rivalry brought excruciating sufferings to the African people. That part of history must not be repeated. Africa must never again be an arena for major-power rivalry. This belief is widely shared by people across Africa, and should be respected by the entire international community.Openness is vital in cooperation with Africa. It is important to share experience and learn from one another, so that Africa's peace and development can benefit from the common effort and contribution of the international community. Africa's cooperation with China has improved its development capacity and business environment, which in turn has created favorable conditions for other countries' cooperation with the continent. China has taken part in more Africa-related trilateral and multilateral cooperation in recent years. We commend and encourage such cooperation and will continue our support.IIIThe past 20 years have been a journey of China and Africa coming together as one community with a shared future. Today, the world is being shaped by changes unseen in a century, a process accelerated by COVID-19. China and Africa are good friends, partners and brothers, and more importantly, an important force for world peace and development. In this changing world, China and Africa need to stay united and work more closely together to make the FOCAC a greater success and further strengthen China-Africa relations, so as to further enhance our friendship and justice in the world.China and Africa can and should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind. The more complex and fluid the international landscape is, the greater the imperative for China and Africa to adhere to the fundamental direction of building a China-Africa community with a shared future. We should continue to follow the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith as well as the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. We need to maintain the momentum of high-level exchange, share more governance experience with each other, build a stronger bond between the Chinese and African peoples, and continue to elevate the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. We need to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, step up mutual support on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and work together for greater democracy in international relations. We need to take the side of the overwhelming majority of the international community, stay committed to multilateralism, and align global governance reforms with the common interests of developing countries. With these efforts, we will make the China-Africa relationship a trailblazer and a shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind.China and Africa can and should set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation. China and Africa have fought hard for what we have achieved in tackling COVID-19. As the virus continues to spread globally, both China and Africa are confronted with the formidable task of combating the virus while stabilizing the economy and protecting people's livelihoods. We will speed up the implementation of the important measures that President Xi Jinping announced at the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, and make China's contribution to making vaccines accessible and affordable for African countries as soon as possible. China will continue to provide COVID-19 containment supplies, send expert teams, and facilitate Africa's procurement of medical supplies from China. China will strive for breaking ground for the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters by the end of this year. These are concrete actions that will show the world that China and Africa have the determination and strength to defeat COVID-19 together.China and Africa can and should unleash greater potential in practical cooperation. COVID-19 will not hamper China-Africa cooperation. As one of the first countries to fully reopen the economy, China aims to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will bring new opportunities for China and Africa to deepen, transform and upgrade their cooperation. China supports Africa's effort to develop the African Continental Free Trade Area. We encourage Chinese companies and financial institutions to take an active part in infrastructure connectivity projects in Africa, which will facilitate cross-border logistics and customs clearance. We are ready to work with the international community in supporting Africa's integration process and sub-regional economic community-building. China hopes to work with Africa to deepen the integration of our industrial and supply chains, and encourages Chinese businesses to invest and conduct technological cooperation in Africa. We will support Africa's agricultural modernization and industrialization drive to raise the added value and competitiveness of Africa's exported energy, mineral and agricultural products. China will work with the international community to support Africa's integration into the global industrial and supply chains. China and Africa should to join hands in pursuing green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. This will contribute to African countries' ability to tackle climate change.As an ancient Chinese saying goes: "Having scaled a cloud-shrouded mountain peak, we rest our horses and set sail for the vast ocean." The China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward. The development of the FOCAC will never take a break. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will continue to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and, with the personal commitment and support of Chinese and African leaders, increase the cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, tighten China-Africa ties against all odds, and achieve greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Friday he was not quitting after tens of thousands of anti-government protesters defied a ban on demonstrations and he warned them not to persist. The ban on gatherings of more than five people was imposed early on Thursday after nearly three months of protests that have called for a reduction in the powers of King Maha Vajiralongkorn's monarchy as well as the removal of Prayuth. Read more:Thailand declares state of emergency to stop protestsProtesters defied the ban and staged one of the biggest demonstrations in Bangkok on Thursday evening. "I'm not quitting," Prayuth told reporters after an emergency cabinet meeting. "The government must use the emergency decree.

After falling by four million at the start of the pandemic because of a $2 trillion emergency federal aid package called the Cares Act, the number of poor people in the U.S. has risen by eight million since May.The University of Chicago and Notre Dame studies found poverty grew by six million people but unlike Columbia University, Chicago and Notre Dame show poverty has continued to grow rather than improve.Bruce D. Meyer, an economist at the University of Chicago and an author of the study told the New York Times these numbers are concerning. "They tell us people are having a lot more trouble paying their bills, paying their rent, putting food on the table," he said. The studies attribute the COVID-19 pandemic and the loss of the Cares Act to the rise in poverty. Columbia researchers say this aid helped keep more than 18 million people out of poverty during its peak in May.The program expanded unemployment benefits and provided stimulus checks for families. And while the Democrats in the House of Representatives has passed multi trillion-dollar aid package, the Republican led Senate has proposed smaller plans, leading to gridlock between both parties.The new studies from Chicago and Notre Dame also show poverty and the pandemic are impacting minority groups the hardest. "Black people and Latinos are more than twice as likely as white people to be poor," according to the studies.Based off new unemployment numbers, the AP reports the economy is still about 10.7 million jobs away from recovering the 22 million jobs lost when the pandemic started.Thursday's unemployment numbers also don't include California, which typically represents about one-fourth of unemployment claims in the country. The state paused processing new claims for two weeks so they could sort through a backlog of claims and implement fraud prevention technology.But unemployment applications rose in 17 other states. A report from Moody's Analytics released Thursday shows nearly 12 million households said they are unsure if they'll be able to continue their mortgage payments.Experts say the rise in unemployment and poverty shows a need for new federal aid. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

This of course means that we too have to make compromises."Instead of unfettered trade among EU member, a no-deal would leave both sides facing tariffs, custom duties and major regulatory burdens at a time when the pandemic has already created the worst economic crisis in decades.Knowing the chances of a deal are slimmer by the day, the EU leaders also urged all in the bloc to "step up their work on preparedness and readiness at all levels and for all outcomes, including that of no agreement."(Cover: File photo of the UK chief trade negotiator David Frost at the European Commission on in Brussels, Belgium./ Getty Images)China's disarmament diplomat Fu Cong on Thursday challenged U.S. claims on nuclear strategy transparency and nuclear arsenal, as Washington has repeatedly called for China to join the so-called trilateral negotiations with Russia.In terms of strategic calculation and avoiding miscalculation, China's nuclear strategy and intention are more transparent and predictable, as China pledges no-first-use of nuclear weapons and never use or threaten to employ nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states, said Fu, head of the arms control department of China's foreign ministry, in an interview with Russian newspaper Kommersant.Fu asserted that China pursues a self-defensive nuclear strategy, serving the purposes of safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and China takes nuclear weapons as the "ultimate deterrence," rejecting U.S. allegations of the so-called China threat.Out of safety and security concerns, China's modernizing its nuclear capacity, and we hope the international society could take an unbiased view on China's effort, Fu said.In fact nuclear forces of other nuclear powers are also undergoing modernization, and the U.S. even plans to inject $1.2 trillion to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, he pointed out.The U.S., with about 6,000 nuclear warheads, is expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence, Fu said, adding that this doctrine poses real threat to other countries.Fu reiterated that China will not participate in trilateral arms control negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to extend the New START, a flagship nuclear arms treaty between the two countries that is due to expire next February.Pressuring China to join such negotiations is "unfair, unreasonable and unfeasible," Fu said, given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is about 20 times the size of China's.China would "be happy to" participate in such talks with the U.S. and Russia, but only if the U.S. agrees to reduce its nuclear arsenal to China's level, Fu said. "But we know that's not going to happen in foreseeable future."For the U.S., urging China to engage in trilateral negotiations is "nothing but a ploy to divert attention" and an excuse for the U.S. to walk away from the New START extension.Fu maintained that China is not shying away from the international nuclear disarmament process and it actually plays an active role in pushing forward international disarmament within the framework of the United Nations.China's disarmament diplomat Fu Cong on Thursday challenged U.S. claims on nuclear strategy transparency and nuclear arsenal, as Washington has repeatedly called for China to join the so-called trilateral negotiations with Russia.In terms of strategic calculation and avoiding miscalculation, China's nuclear strategy and intention are more transparent and predictable, as China pledges no-first-use of nuclear weapons and never use or threaten to employ nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states, said Fu, head of the arms control department of China's foreign ministry, in an interview with Russian newspaper Kommersant.Fu asserted that China pursues a self-defensive nuclear strategy, serving the purposes of safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and China takes nuclear weapons as the "ultimate deterrence," rejecting U.S. allegations of the so-called China threat.Out of safety and security concerns, China's modernizing its nuclear capacity, and we hope the international society could take an unbiased view on China's effort, Fu said.In fact nuclear forces of other nuclear powers are also undergoing modernization, and the U.S. even plans to inject $1.2 trillion to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, he pointed out.The U.S., with about 6,000 nuclear warheads, is expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence, Fu said, adding that this doctrine poses real threat to other countries.Fu reiterated that China will not participate in trilateral arms control negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to extend the New START, a flagship nuclear arms treaty between the two countries that is due to expire next February.Pressuring China to join such negotiations is "unfair, unreasonable and unfeasible," Fu said, given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is about 20 times the size of China's.China would "be happy to" participate in such talks with the U.S. and Russia, but only if the U.S. agrees to reduce its nuclear arsenal to China's level, Fu said.

The two sides have overcome adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, maintained communication and exchanges and further deepened cooperation in all fields.While appreciating China's commitment to make its COVID-19 vaccine a global public good when available, Don said his country hopes to strengthen cooperation with China on vaccine development and open the "fast lane" to facilitate personnel exchanges at an early date.Thailand is steadily pacing up the construction of the Thailand-China high-speed rail and supports the connection between the China-Laos Railway and the Thailand-China high-speed rail. Thailand hopes that China will continue to support the construction of the country's Eastern Economic Corridor and enhance the cooperation in the fields of innovation and sustainable development, the Thai foreign minister said.Thailand is ready to step up coordination with China in regional and international affairs and advance the development of ties between ASEAN and China to strengthen international solidarity to fight the COVID-19 pandemic and revive the global economy, he added. China and Thailand have agreed to create "fast tracks" and "green lanes" to facilitate the flow of people and goods, China's foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday, as the two countries seek to revive their economies from the global coronavirus pandemic.The announcement came after Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi's meeting with Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha in Bangkok.Thailand is the last stop of Wang's five-day visit to Southeast Asian countries.The two sides discussed cooperation in various fields in the post-pandemic era, and vowed strengthening ties.Wang also held separate talks with Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai, and the two signed cooperation documents.China-Thailand relations have shown resilience and huge potential during the COVID-19 pandemic, Wang said, adding that China is ready to work with Thailand to enhance anti-epidemic collaboration, conduct cooperation on vaccine and medicine research and development. The countries should advance the joint construction of the Belt and Road and speed up the building of the China-Thailand high-speed railway for an early connection to the China-Laos Railway in order to improve regional interconnectivity, Wang continued.Speaking of bilateral cooperation, Wang said China is ready to promote the connection between Thailand's Eastern Economic Corridor initiative with south China's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and encourage Chinese enterprises to take part in the related projects.Regarding regional cooperation, Wang said China is willing to work with Thailand under the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) framework to close the deal of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) within this year.He also said the two countries should implement the results achieved at the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation (LMC) Leaders' Meeting, push forward the synergy of the LMC and the New International Land-Sea Trade Corridor, and make the LMC and the Ayeyawady-Chao Phraya-Mekong Economic Cooperation Strategy (ACMECS) Master Plan to complement each other.For his part, Don said this year marks the 45th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.

China's mass coordinated testing and targeted containment model, as shown with recent outbreaks in Beijing, Dalian and Urumqi, have proved continually successful in quashing a return of the virus, allowing life to continue as normal."This is totally different from how most European and other Western countries have approached the pandemic. Most countries still aren't conducting adequate tests. In countries such as Poland, France, Italy and Spain, mostly only the symptomatic cases are being tested and the positive cases are advised home quarantine and not immediate hospitalization as in China. And this is a huge mistake," said Dr Agnieszka Bielewicz, internal medicine specialist at ParkWayHealth, one of China's leading international healthcare providers.She noted that the European countries would do well to follow Qingdao's example. "When I say all the 9-10 million people in Qingdao are being tested, many in Europe find it hard to believe. I keep repeating that China's approach in fighting the pandemic has been absolutely outstanding and this is why people in China, including the foreigners, are really enjoying a mostly normal life now because we are free."Bielewicz, who has been living in China with her husband and three kids for over eight years, admitted however that she feels the pangs of "survival guilty" at times because her friends and relatives back in Poland cannot experience the same freedoms."It is a strange feeling. COVID-19 is not only affecting human life and health, it is affecting people's minds very deeply â their characters and feelings. It has turned our life upside down. Today, COVID-19 is affecting even global politics, economy, and each aspect of our life," she remarked thoughtfully.'I'm a doctor, I cannot give up'While the doctor now worries about her kith and kin in her home country, during the initial days of the outbreak when as a healthcare worker she was tending to her duties, it was her family and friends in Poland who were deeply concerned about her, as China was the epicenter of the pandemic at the time."As a foreign doctor, I was designated to work for the Chinese New Year holiday when all of my Chinese colleagues were to celebrate with their family. When the outbreak happened, I was already working. As the situation became uncertain, I decided to send my family back to Poland," she recalled."The entire time my family was in Poland, they were worried about my situation, about my work. And to this extent that they called me several times a day to check whether I have any symptoms," she said, noting the healthcare workers were at the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 and therefore more prone to infection."My family was really terrified that I was still working, but I'm a doctor, I cannot give up. I explained to them that due to the safety protocols and all the rules strictly introduced and implemented, I felt very safe even during the peak of the outbreak in China," she said.Bielewicz was fortunate to be reunited with her family before the international travel restrictions came into force and situation in Europe worsened. "With China enforcing strict prevention and control measures, things were improving here. I told my family that it is very safe here and they returned early March. Thankfully, my children didn't have to experience the full lockdown anywhere and they came back at a good time."'China is doing better than the rest'With COVID-19 subsequently spreading in Europe and other parts of the world, the world also witnessed a sustained campaign of disinformation against China and COVID-19, triggered by geopolitics.Bielewicz, as a health professional with a closer insight into the situation on the ground, felt compelled to clear some of the doubts through media appearances in Polish TV. At the time, people in Europe thought that the COVID-19 situation was horrific in China, that the hospitals were overcrowded, and that patients were dying in droves.The exaggerated media reports were laughable, the Polish doctor felt. "I gave several interviews to Polish TV channels explaining to them that the situation wasn't so crazy. We weren't dying [in droves]. We were not hungry. I showed them the photos of life in Shanghai, the buses, shops and streets. We could still use 'kuaidi' [express delivery] to buy things that we wanted," she elucidated.Bielewicz said people still find it hard to believe how successful China's COVID-19 fight has been. "Many people ask my mom, who is a nurse in Poland, about the situation in China and when she tells them that China has nearly curbed COVID-19 with almost zero local transmission and most new cases being imported, people react in disbelieve. They say it is impossible."The Polish healthcare professional felt that this is symptomatic of the Western media narrative that has constantly pushed a narrative of China as a "third-world" country and therefore people find it difficult to believe that "China is doing better than we are doing."Will there be a second wave?While the recent Qingdao outbreak has prompted fears about a second wave, more so, as the winter flu season is approaching in China, Bielewicz expressed confidence about the protocols and measures in place even if there's a spike."I'm not worried too much over a second wave in China. We just witnessed how everything was controlled in Qingdao and we also know the exact source," she said. The health professional, however, strongly advocated for flu vaccination."I and all of my family members, we have flu vaccination and I encourage my patients, especially those with existing ailments such as like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetic and obesity to take vaccination for flu. I also suggest to take a pneumococcal vaccination because it protects lives," she said."Besides, I've been a big fan of Vitamin D which helps in boosting our immune system and making our bodies stronger. This can help our body fight the virus better in case of an infection," she added.Interviewer and script: Abhishek G BhayaVideo editors: Chen Shi &amp; Li YahuiCover image: Li JingjieDirector: Mei YanMore CGTN Interviews:'China's carbon neutral goal: Bold and inspiring''When China and U.S. work together, the entire world wins' Radical China-U.S. decoupling will throw humanity back by decadese-RMB: China gears up for digital payment 2.0Currency War: Will China's e-RMB fade out dollar's global sheen?TikTok, Huawei and Trump's tech war on ChinaHimalayan crossroads: A bumpy road ahead for China-India tiesTracing the origin and ecology of coronavirusInnovative China drives the global AI revolutionChina-India-Pakistan cooperation key for unleashing South Asia's full potentialPost-Brexit UK needs a 'balanced approach' towards China and an FTAHK &amp; U.S.: A tale of two protests and Trump's doublespeak'Hong Kong protest is pure bigotry and racism'India's COVID-19 lockdown and its side effectsMERS experience, China's situation shaped S Korea's COVID-19 strategyPost COVID-19, tourism could be 'slow' but 'smart'From dreams to doubts: Chinese students reconsider U.S. options amid COVID-19 worriesChina's night economy surges amid COVID-19 lifestyle changesThe way China responded to the latest spate of COVID-19 cases in Qingdao is a stark reminder of how the "outstanding" Chinese approach in dealing with the pandemic is radically different from most Western countries, a Shanghai-based Polish doctor told CGTN Digital as she narrated how her professional and personal life has been affected by the pandemic.Authorities in Qingdao, east China's Shandong Province have collected nearly 10 million samples in a five-day nucleic acid testing campaign after the emergence of a handful of cases earlier this week.

On Thursday there were 6,638 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. The previous record was 6,294 on March 28, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The total number of cases now stands at 341,223 and the death toll has also increased, by 33 to 9,710.This comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Wednesday more measures to curb the pandemic, by lowering the threshold for a city to be considered a high risk-area from 35 to the previous 50 cases per 100,000. This will put a third of the whole country on "high-alert." The chancellor also warned more measures will be put in place in the coming days, such as stricter travel restrictions.  Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamPrime Minister Mark Rutte admitted his government made mistakes in managing the coronavirus crisis. According to Rutte, the previous package of measures was not severe enough. Also, the government had not thought through all the actions correctly, the prime minister said.In many places in the Netherlands, it was crowded on Wednesday evening in the last hours before pubs and restaurants had to close their doors. Images of people partying in The Hague caused a stir in parliament. Social media showed people singing and dancing in a crowded party tent in the city center. The mayor called their behavior "irresponsible" and is considering legal action against those present. Since Wednesday at 10 p.m., all restaurants, bars and cafes have been closed for at least four weeks. Take-away and delivery are still allowed.Unemployment in The Netherlands decreased for the first time since the start of the pandemic. In September, 4.4 percent of the active population was jobless, compared with 4.6 percent a month earlier. In February, the last "normal" month, unemployment was 2.9 percent.On Wednesday, there were 7,350 new infections in The Netherlands, a small fall from Tuesday. Nawied Jabarkhyl in LondonTighter lockdown restrictions have been imposed on the England's capital London. Measures, which come into effect at midnight on Friday, include a ban on households mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Similar rules are also being put in place in the regions of Essex and York and are being considered in Manchester as the government attempts to slow the spread of the virus.Meanwhile, the UK's former homelessness adviser has warned the country faces a "period of destitution," partly because of the coronavirus.

We need each other. We'll get through it together." Mia Alberti in FrankfurtGermany has hit a record-high number of daily cases. On Thursday there were 6,638 new cases of the coronavirus, the highest number since the beginning of the pandemic. The previous record was 6,294 on March 28, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The total number of cases now stands at 341,223 and the death toll has also increased, by 33 to 9,710.This comes as German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced on Wednesday more measures to curb the pandemic, by lowering the threshold for a city to be considered a high risk-area from 35 to the previous 50 cases per 100,000. This will put a third of the whole country on "high-alert." The chancellor also warned more measures will be put in place in the coming days, such as stricter travel restrictions.  Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamPrime Minister Mark Rutte admitted his government made mistakes in managing the coronavirus crisis. According to Rutte, the previous package of measures was not severe enough. Also, the government had not thought through all the actions correctly, the prime minister said.In many places in the Netherlands, it was crowded on Wednesday evening in the last hours before pubs and restaurants had to close their doors. Images of people partying in The Hague caused a stir in parliament. Social media showed people singing and dancing in a crowded party tent in the city center. The mayor called their behavior "irresponsible" and is considering legal action against those present. Since Wednesday at 10 p.m., all restaurants, bars and cafes have been closed for at least four weeks. Take-away and delivery are still allowed.Unemployment in The Netherlands decreased for the first time since the start of the pandemic. In September, 4.4 percent of the active population was jobless, compared with 4.6 percent a month earlier. In February, the last "normal" month, unemployment was 2.9 percent.On Wednesday, there were 7,350 new infections in The Netherlands, a small fall from Tuesday. Nawied Jabarkhyl in LondonTighter lockdown restrictions have been imposed on the England's capital London. Measures, which come into effect at midnight on Friday, include a ban on households mixing indoors, including in pubs and restaurants. Similar rules are also being put in place in the regions of Essex and York and are being considered in Manchester as the government attempts to slow the spread of the virus.Meanwhile, the UK's former homelessness adviser has warned the country faces a "period of destitution," partly because of the coronavirus. Louise Casey said the impact of COVID-19 could be devastating on the most deprived parts of the UK's population.  FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: IMF chief says China's recovery helps global recoveryCGTN America: Trump's youngest son Barron had COVID-19, now tests negativeCGTN Africa: COVID-19 causes "unimaginable" impact on Africa's socio economic landscapeSign up here to get the COVID-19 Europe bulletin sent directly to your inboxCGTN Europe has been providing in-depth coverage of the novel coronavirus story as it has unfolded. Here you can read the essential information about the crisis.Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the United States is seeking to destabilize Tibet by appointing the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues, calling the move an interference in China's internal affairs.On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Robert Destro as the special coordinator.Tibetan affairs are China's domestic affairs, and China strongly opposes any form of foreign interference, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a daily briefing."The setting up of the so-called coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China's internal affairs and destabilize Tibet. China firmly opposes that," Zhao said.Tibet has achieved remarkable social and economic growth since its peaceful liberation in 1950, and the living standard of the people there has also improved, he said.All ethnic groups in Tibet are part of the big family of the Chinese nation, and people in Tibet enjoy religious freedom, and their rights are fully respected, he added.Earlier on Thursday, Tibetan authorities announced that the region had eliminated absolute poverty, claiming a "major victory." China's Tibet Autonomous Region has achieved a "major victory" in alleviating poverty, Wu Yingjie, the Communist Party of China chief of the region, said at a press conference in Lhasa.  By the end of 2019, Tibet had lifted 628,000 people out of poverty and removed 74 county-level areas from the poverty list, Wu said. Tibet is now shifting its focus from tackling absolute poverty to consolidating poverty alleviation achievements, he continued.  The achievement shows "the advantages of the socialist system on the high plateau," Wu said.  (Cover: Nijia and his family pose for a photo in front of their house at the Rongma relocation settlement, a local poverty alleviation project, in Gurum Township of Lhasa, capital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, April 2, 2020. /Xinhua)Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday that the United States is seeking to destabilize Tibet by appointing the so-called special coordinator for Tibetan issues, calling the move an interference in China's internal affairs.On Wednesday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appointed Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor Robert Destro as the special coordinator.Tibetan affairs are China's domestic affairs, and China strongly opposes any form of foreign interference, the Foreign Ministry's spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a daily briefing."The setting up of the so-called coordinator for Tibetan issues is entirely out of political manipulation to interfere in China's internal affairs and destabilize Tibet.

roles in supporting and participating in China's modernization, promoting Chinese culture, facilitating peace and unity of the country and deepening exchanges and cooperation between China and the world. Talking with residents and tourists at an old downtown area in Shantou, Xi said on the 40th anniversary of the SEZs, his visit to Shantou SEZ is a statement to both China and the international community that the CPC will lead the Chinese people in unswervingly following the path of reform and opening-up, working hard to advance socialist modernization, and striving to realize the Chinese

lodged solemn representations with the U.S. for imposing sanctions on Chinese personnel, said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday.China will take countermeasures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and relevant personnel if the United States insists on going down the wrong path, Zhao stressed.The U.S. State Department on Wednesday warned international financial institutions that if they were found doing business with relevant individuals in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, they could soon face tough sanctions.China urged the United States to correct its mistake and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way.The HKSAR government in a statement released on Thursday strongly opposed and condemned the report issued by the United States under the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Act, calling it groundless and irresponsible.Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society has regained stability, national security has been guaranteed in the city and residents can again enjoy basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, said the statement.The "sanctions" by the United States have no legal effect on financial institutions in Hong Kong, and the chief executive and other officials targeted by the U.S. have made it clear that they will continue to carry out their duty of safeguarding national security in Hong Kong in accordance with the law, the statement added.The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese foreign ministry in the HKSAR Thursday also expressed firm opposition to and solemnly refuted to the so-called report.A spokesperson of the office said the U.S. ignored the fact that Hong Kong is becoming more stable and better, and the mainstream public opinion is that Hong Kong society is regrouping and starting again, and the principle of international law of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries should be respected.The U.S. side concocted the so-called Law, defamed the national security law in Hong Kong, smeared the actions taken by the central government of China and the HKSAR government to set things right, imposed sanctions on officials of the central government of China and the HKSAR government, and propped up those who are anti-China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong. This has once again exposed the sinister intentions of the U.S. in its attempt to contain China's development, the spokesperson said. However, the wrong words and deeds of the U.S. cannot stop the steady and enduring growth of "One Country, Two Systems" and the prospect of Hong Kong's integration into the development of the country. The spokesperson stressed that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs.

They have also called for reforms to the monarchy of King Maha Vajiralongkorn.Thailand is technically still under a state of emergency as part of coronavirus restrictions.The police operation came after Prayuth declared a severe state of emergency in the Bangkok area to allow authorities to move against the protests. It bans unauthorized gatherings of more than five people.Before the police dispersal, a large number of protesters had already left the area after one of the their leaders announced the end of the rally at Government House though a few hundred stayed on. Protesters also announced that the rally would move to a different location in the capital Thursday afternoon, but deputy police spokesman Col.

Before leaving Democracy Monument, several small clashes broke out between protesters and their opponents, who traded punches and threw plastic bottles as police tried to keep them apart. The protest movement was launched in March by university students but quickly put on hold as Thailand was gripped by surges in coronavirus cases. It came back in July, when the threat from the virus eased, and since then has again been spearheaded by students and publicized on social media.The movement's original core demands were new elections, changes in the constitution to make it more democratic, and an end to intimidation of activists.The protesters charge that Prayuth, who as army commander led a 2014 coup that toppled an elected government, was returned to power unfairly in last year's general election because laws had been changed to favor a pro-military party.

Protesters say a constitution promulgated under military rule is undemocratic.(With inputs from AP)The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) naval and aerial forces closely followed the U.S. warship when it trespassed into China's Taiwan Straits on Wednesday, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said.The U.S. has taken a series of moves that sent misleading signal to those separatists on the island, Zhang said, warning the U.S. that it should stop sending the wrong signals.Zhang added that the Eastern Theater Command remains vigilant and will take all necessary means to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.(Cover image: Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, speaks at a press conference, April 16, 2019. /Xinhua)The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) naval and aerial forces closely followed the U.S. warship when it trespassed into China's Taiwan Straits on Wednesday, Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said.The U.S. has taken a series of moves that sent misleading signal to those separatists on the island, Zhang said, warning the U.S. that it should stop sending the wrong signals.Zhang added that the Eastern Theater Command remains vigilant and will take all necessary means to defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.(Cover image: Senior Colonel Zhang Chunhui, a spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, speaks at a press conference, April 16, 2019. /Xinhua)The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated Wednesday, as both sides exchanged accusations and claims of new attacks over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, where heavy fighting is continuing for a third week despite a Russia-brokered cease-fire deal.Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, emphasizing the need to respect the truce that was violated immediately after taking effect Saturday. Putin also voiced concern about the involvement in the conflict by militants from the Middle East â a reference to Turkey deploying Syrian fighters to combat Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.The two leaders "stressed the urgent need for joint efforts to end the bloodshed as soon as possible and move to a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem," according to a Kremlin readout of the call. Their first since fighting erupted late last month.In a sign that the conflict was widening, Azerbaijan's military said it destroyed an Armenian missile system on the territory of Armenia that was positioned to target civilian areas. Armenia's Defense Ministry responded by stating that it reserves the right to target Azerbaijani military objects and troop movements.So far, Armenia and Azerbaijan have denied targeting each other's territory in the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, although each of the parties often contested the denials.An expansion of hostilities could trigger a dangerous escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994. The Armenian forces have also controlled significant chunks of Azerbaijani territory outside the separatist region.The mutual accusations and threats raised concern about the safety of a strategic pipeline that carries Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea crude oil to Turkey and on to Western markets.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev threatened "very heavy response," should Armenia "carry out its plans to destroy" oil and gas pipelines in Azerbaijan.The failure of the truce that was supposed to begin Saturday reflects the uncompromising positions of the two South Caucasus nations that have stymied decades of diplomatic efforts. The escalation of fighting raises the specter of a wider conflict that could draw in Russia and Turkey and threaten Caspian Sea energy exports.Azerbaijan and Turkey have accepted Russia's mediation and grudgingly agreed to a truce, but they have made it clear that see the cease-fire as temporary until Armenia agrees to pull back its forces from Nagorno-Karabakh. Turkey reiterated its support for Azerbaijan. Unlike previous outbursts of hostilities over Nagorno-Karabakh, NATO-member Turkey, which has close ethnic, cultural and historic bonds with Azerbaijan, vowed to help Azerbaijan reclaim its territory. Armenian officials say Turkey is directly involved in the conflict and is sending Syrian mercenaries to fight on Azerbaijan's side. Turkey has denied deploying combatants to the region, but a Syrian war monitor and Syria-based opposition activists have confirmed that Turkey has sent hundreds of Syrian opposition fighters to fight in Nagorno-Karabakh.Co-chaired by France, Russia and the United States, the OSCE Minsk Group has worked to find a resolution to the decades-long conflict, and the Kremlin said Wednesday that Putin and Erdogan hope Turkey will play a role towards de-escalation as a permanent member.Ongoing shelling by both sides has left a ceasefire agreed last week in Moscow hanging in the balance, but "both sides confirmed the importance of observing the humanitarian truce," the Kremlin said.(With inputs from agencies)The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan escalated Wednesday, as both sides exchanged accusations and claims of new attacks over the separatist territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, where heavy fighting is continuing for a third week despite a Russia-brokered cease-fire deal.Russian President Vladimir Putin spoke by phone with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan, emphasizing the need to respect the truce that was violated immediately after taking effect Saturday.

But in a world ravaged by man-made and natural disasters, the UN food body soon became synonymous with survival for millions facing hunger and starvation. On October 9, the WFP's 17,000 employees were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for fighting a relentless war against hunger in conflict zones in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Speaking exclusively to CGTN Digital, the WFP's deputy executive director Amir Mahmoud Abdulla described the recognition as a "great honor" and "quite humbling."The Norwegian Nobel Committee lauded the WFP for its efforts in "preventing the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict."Calling hunger "the world's biggest solvable problem," Abdulla said the award raises the organization's profile and draws the world's attention toward the link between hunger and conflict, and hunger and COVID-19. "It's not just about being able to raise more resources â for us that's hugely important because we are a voluntarily funded organization â but what's important is that there's an attention of the world on this issue of hunger â hunger caused by conflict or people's lack of earning power. Both of those problems are solvable," he said, hoping that the acknowledgment will "move the world closer to a world of zero hunger."But the goal sounds more like a dream in pandemic-wracked 2020. In 2019, the WFP assisted more than 97 million people â the largest number since 2012 â in 88 countries. According to a WFP projection, the number of hungry people could double from 135 million in 2019 to 265 million by the end of 2020. The Global Report on Food Crisis published in April puts the figure for people facing chronic food insecurity at an astonishing 821 million.With fractured supply chains, restrictions on movement, and shrinking coffers of donor governments and financial institutions, the task of putting food in the plates of those who need it the most has become even more daunting."First of all, the impact on supply lines. When you had certain restrictions being put in place. Second, the ability of people to move. Our field and humanitarian workers are moving all over the world, and we are moving them around. So that created an issue. And those who we serve suddenly found themselves more stressed than usual because of the economic impact. Also, many casual workers found themselves out of work. We found that the numbers of people who needed assistance were increasing. All of these issues compounded as the WFP is a totally 100-percent voluntarily funded organization," Abdulla said.The WFP, one of world's largest humanitarian organizations tackling hunger and food insecurity, needs to raise $6.8 billion to avert the impacts of the coronavirus crisis. So far, the Nobel laureate body has only managed to bag $1.6 billion.Emphasizing that food security, peace and stability go hand in hand, Abdulla pointed out that 10 out of 13 food crises today are caused by conflict. "Longer-term developmental solutions are required. Solutions that would include helping smallholder farmers with their own agriculture, if there are people have lost their livelihood, then putting income generation or sort of livelihood schemes. So, it's a multi-faceted approach that requires more than just the World Food Programme. That's the one thing about the work we do, we need to that in partnership with many," he said.Talking about the food crisis in Yemen, Abdulla urged warring parties to allow unhindered access for humanitarian workers to get to the places they need to. "We have seen in certain parts of Yemen our inability to supply because we are unable to get the conditions that we need to be able to monitor and be absolutely sure that the right people were getting the food, or we just had no access at all. Neither our goods nor our people have been able get through. So, the only solution is constant dialogue. We never give up and we always continue to negotiate," he said.October 16 marks World Food Day, which is dedicated to addressing the problem of global hunger and malnutrition. According to the WFP, hunger isn't always a lack of food. "Climate change is something that we need to get to grips with for sure. There's also the aspect of food waste and food lost. What's really important to recognize is that there's food waste is often in developed countries and there's food loss is many countries where we serve. And that loss is when it's lost in fields before harvesting or lost in storage before harvesting," said Abdulla, adding "if we could manage the waste in developed countries and avoid the loss in developing countries, that combined food almost on its own would solve hunger."This year 107 organizations and 215 individuals were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, including the World Health Organization and 17-year-old celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg. But a "workable scheme" that began 59 years ago grabbed the Nobel glory."We have never lost sight of what we would really like to do and that is to go back to being an experiment that could actually say: 'The experiment is over, world hunger is solved. We don't need WFP.' If we get to that, then we can say it was a successful experiment. Now it remains a project in course, and as long as we are needed our staff will be out doing what they are needed to do," Abdulla concluded. The World Food Programme (WFP) was born out of an experiment in 1961.

The Trump administration cut funding to the Census Bureau. It has attempted to exclude undocumented immigrants and tried repeatedly to end the count ahead of schedule. Earlier this month, a federal judge issued an order stating the census could continue counting through the end of October.The COVID-19 pandemic also brought unprecedented problems with this year's population count. Coupled with roadblocks from the U.S. government, experts fear the census will be inaccurate and impact communities that already struggle with insufficient resources and representation.The goal of the census is to essentially count how many people live in a community. It's done every 10 years, and the data from the count determines how many congressional seats each states get in the House of Representatives and how much federal funding communities receive for education, healthcare and other public services. By ending it early, the New York Times reports, White House officials could use that data to their advantage.Minority groups and poor and young people who move frequently are often left out of the census or undercounted because they can be difficult to reach. These groups tend to live in urban areas that are often represented by Democrats. Ending the census early could deepen an undercount and "dilute" Democratic political representation, according to the New York Times.Because of COVID-19, the Census Bureau had previously received extensions for completing the count and turning in results. The deadline for finishing was pushed from the end of July to the end of October.In its push to end the count early, the Trump administration argued the Bureau would need to stop counting immediately so it could make the legal deadline of December 31 for delivering results to the president. The Trump administration would have the data needed to control representation in Congress, no matter who wins the presidential election.With the Supreme Court ruling, experts are not only concerned with undercounting and the politicization of the census but also an increase in distrust toward the bureau. Some are questioning the quality of this yearâs results and whether they can be trusted. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized," the key pacifist article in the constitution reads.Nevertheless, at the end of last month, Japan's Defense Ministry requested a record 5.49 trillion yen (about $52.17 billion) budget for the fiscal year starting in April 2021, with the request rising 3.3 percent from the initial budget for the current fiscal year through March 2021.With the ministry eyeing allocations for enhancing capabilities in outer space, cyberspace as well as financing for land-based infrastructure and hardware, Japan's defense spending under new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is looking set to rise for the ninth straight year.Japan on Wednesday unveiled its newest 3,000-ton submarine named Taigei which was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. amid no signs of the nation reining in its ever-increasing and constitutionally questionable "defense" spending.The submarine was unveiled at a shipyard in western Japan and is slated to go into service as the 22nd vessel in the Maritime Self-Defense Force's (MSDF) submarine fleet in March 2022.Tokyo has been planning to boost the number of its subs from 16 to 22 under plans laid out in its National Defense Program Guidelines in 2010, and Taigei, which means "big whale" in Japanese, will be able to house 70 crew members.The vessel is 84 meters in length and 9.1 meters in width and comes with a price tag of around 76 billion yen (about $722.23 million) to build, the MSDF said, adding that the incorporation of lithium-ion batteries allow the vessel to remain under water for longer than previous models.According to the MSDF, Japan currently operates nine 2,750-ton Oyashio-class submarines and 11 2,950-ton Soryu-class warships.The MSDF is planning to introduce a 12th Soryu-class sub next year, it said.As for the new Taigei, it will be the first in the new Taigei-class category following the Oyashio and Soryu, the MSDF explained.Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi, MSDF Chief of Staff Hiroshi Yamamura and around 150 others attended a ceremony Wednesday held at a Japanese defense equipment maker's Kobe Shipyard in Hyogo Prefecture.Japan is still bound by the constraints of its pacifist constitution, Article 9 of which states that the "Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.""In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.

It seems that those working in education can be sacrificed. It is also not possible to know where, to what extent the epidemic has spread, the trade union does not have access to the data," the union said.  Toni Waterman in BrusselsBelgium hit a new record of daily infections on Friday with 7,030 cases.  The average daily rate also continues to spike with more than 5,000 new cases recorded in the past week, up 93 percent from the previous period. Hospitals in Belgium are now bracing for a flood of COVID-19 patients. Medical facilities will go into phase 1A from today, meaning that 25 percent of intensive care unit beds are reserved for coronavirus patients.

Over the past four decades, Shenzhen has been transformed from a small fishing village into a modern metropolis with a permanent population of over 13 million. "The world economy is currently facing complicated challenges. By no means should we be stopped by the reversing trends and tides. We should choose the right side of the history to unswervingly expand opening-up in an all-round way, and promote the building of an open world economy and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind," Chinese President Xi Jinping told the gathering. At a time when the global economic recovery has been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-globalization sentiment, China in May this year brought to the table a new development pattern. Known as "dual circulation," it takes the domestic market as the mainstay while letting domestic and foreign markets boost each other. "The new development pattern is not a closed domestic circulation, but an open domestic and international dual circulation," Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed in the speech. He pointed out the need to explore a more flexible policy system and a more scientific management system in domestic and international trade, investment and financing, fiscal and tax affairs, financial innovation and border entry and exit. Shenzhen, a miracle in world development Shenzhen is a brand-new city created by the CPC and the Chinese people since the country's reform and opening-up and its development over the past 40 years is a miracle in the world development history, Xi said. Read more:Shenzhen at 40: A snapshot of landmarks over the years One small step for Shenzhen, one giant leap for China From 1980 to 2019, Shenzhen's GDP rose from 270 million yuan to 2.7 trillion yuan ($40 million to $400 billion), with an average annual growth rate of 20.7 percent, according to Xi. Its fiscal revenue also increased from less than 100 million yuan to 942.4 billion yuan ($14.9 million to $139.8 billion) during the period. Its total imports and exports climbed from $18 million in 1980 to $431.5 billion in 2019, an average annual growth rate of 26.1 percent, contributing to an all-around opening up, Xi summarized. People's livelihoods have also greatly improved in Shenzhen, with tremendous advancements in education, medical care, housing and other areas. Its per capita disposable income skyrocketed to 62,500 yuan ($9,272) in 2019, a 31.6-fold growth compared to that of 1985.Valuable experience Xi stressed the valuable experience from the development miracles of the special economic zones (SEZs) including Shenzhen. Below is some of the advice offered by the president: -- adhere to the concept that development is of paramount importance, insist on the practices of daring to try and daring to be the first, and pursue reform breakthroughs through creative thoughts. -- remain committed to opening-up on all fronts and continuously enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going out." -- take innovation as the primary driving force and win the upper hand in global technological revolution and industrial transformation. -- follow the people-centered philosophy of development to allow the people to benefit more from the achievements of reform and development in a fairer way. -- ensure scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality and universal law-abiding to make rule of law an important guarantee for the development of the SEZs. -- carry out the philosophy of "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets" to achieve sustained development of economy and society as well as ecology and environment in a comprehensive and coordinated way. -- implement the fundamental principle of "One Country, Two Systems" in a comprehensive and accurate way, and promote the integrated development of the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao. -- give full play to the leading and exemplary role of the SEZs while making overall plans for the country, so that they can contribute more to national development. 'Engine' for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hailing Shenzhen as an "engine" for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s development, Xi asked Shenzhen to take active moves to further promote the construction of the area and called for efforts to synergize economic rules and mechanisms in the three regions. The GBA Initiative was first mentioned in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and aims to combine the three regions in order to turn it into one of the world's top bay areas and world-class city clusters. Read more: Why is the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area crucial? The area encompasses the special administrative regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macao, as well as cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen in southern China's Guangdong Province. Local governments need to build regional railroads, allowing talents and goods to flow between the area more efficiently, which will improve market integration, said Xi. The country will deepen the reform and opening-up of the Qianhai-Shenzhen-Hong Kong pilot cooperation zone and speed up the construction of a comprehensive national science center in the GBA to enhance coordination and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao. The GBA's platform should be fully utilized to attract more young talents from Hong Kong and Macao to come to the region to study, work and build a life, providing them with a deeper and wider level of communication and understanding of each other, the president continued. Xi welcomed greater participation of foreign countries in the reform, opening-up and development of China's special economic zones.  He said foreign participation has been indispensable in building the economic zones over the past 40 years, assisting in the creation of vast development opportunities and offering development benefits for foreign countries.Continuous reform and wider opening-up were key terms in President Xi's speech at the grand gathering, or as some experts pointed out, the southern Chinese city is the best example that shows the need for further opening-up.Read more:CGTN Opinion: Wider opening-up a key takeaway from Xi's speech"As China's first special economic zone and through the launch of a market-driven scheme that supported the attraction of a large number of foreign investments, the city has become instrumental in making China a prominent player in today's global economy," commented Matteo Giovannini, a Beijing-based finance professional. The city is home to various leading Chinese tech companies, including telecoms giant Huawei and technology conglomerate Tencent, two of the major companies that the U.S. has been putting pressure on in the most recently souring China-U.S. ties. Some say President Xi's trip "soothes their nerves.""Xi's visit to Shenzhen and the unveiling of the plan are aimed to encourage the development of the tech industry," Chief Economist for Hang Seng Bank Dan Wang told South China Morning Post.According to Giovannini, the trip also shines a light at China's continuous determination to open its arms to the international community."(His trip) represents an opportunity to emphasize China's uninterrupted commitment to further domestic integration and market opening-up to the rest of the world," he said.China on Wednesday vowed to unswervingly expand the all-around opening-up of its economy as it held a grand gathering marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in this boomtown in southern Guangdong Province. On August 26, 1980, China's national legislature approved the establishment of special economic zones in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou in Guangdong Province and Xiamen in Fujian Province.

Known as "dual circulation," it takes the domestic market as the mainstay while letting domestic and foreign markets boost each other. "The new development pattern is not a closed domestic circulation, but an open domestic and international dual circulation," Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed in the speech. He pointed out the need to explore a more flexible policy system and a more scientific management system in domestic and international trade, investment and financing, fiscal and tax affairs, financial innovation and border entry and exit. Shenzhen, a miracle in world development Shenzhen is a brand-new city created by the CPC and the Chinese people since the country's reform and opening-up and its development over the past 40 years is a miracle in the world development history, Xi said. Read more:Shenzhen at 40: A snapshot of landmarks over the years One small step for Shenzhen, one giant leap for China From 1980 to 2019, Shenzhen's GDP rose from 270 million yuan to 2.7 trillion yuan ($40 million to $400 billion), with an average annual growth rate of 20.7 percent, according to Xi. Its fiscal revenue also increased from less than 100 million yuan to 942.4 billion yuan ($14.9 million to $139.8 billion) during the period. Its total imports and exports climbed from $18 million in 1980 to $431.5 billion in 2019, an average annual growth rate of 26.1 percent, contributing to an all-around opening up, Xi summarized. People's livelihoods have also greatly improved in Shenzhen, with tremendous advancements in education, medical care, housing and other areas. Its per capita disposable income skyrocketed to 62,500 yuan ($9,272) in 2019, a 31.6-fold growth compared to that of 1985.Valuable experience Xi stressed the valuable experience from the development miracles of the special economic zones (SEZs) including Shenzhen. Below is some of the advice offered by the president: -- adhere to the concept that development is of paramount importance, insist on the practices of daring to try and daring to be the first, and pursue reform breakthroughs through creative thoughts. -- remain committed to opening-up on all fronts and continuously enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going out." -- take innovation as the primary driving force and win the upper hand in global technological revolution and industrial transformation. -- follow the people-centered philosophy of development to allow the people to benefit more from the achievements of reform and development in a fairer way. -- ensure scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality and universal law-abiding to make rule of law an important guarantee for the development of the SEZs. -- carry out the philosophy of "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets" to achieve sustained development of economy and society as well as ecology and environment in a comprehensive and coordinated way. -- implement the fundamental principle of "One Country, Two Systems" in a comprehensive and accurate way, and promote the integrated development of the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao. -- give full play to the leading and exemplary role of the SEZs while making overall plans for the country, so that they can contribute more to national development. 'Engine' for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hailing Shenzhen as an "engine" for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s development, Xi asked Shenzhen to take active moves to further promote the construction of the area and called for efforts to synergize economic rules and mechanisms in the three regions. The GBA Initiative was first mentioned in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and aims to combine the three regions in order to turn it into one of the world's top bay areas and world-class city clusters. Read more: Why is the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area crucial? The area encompasses the special administrative regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macao, as well as cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen in southern China's Guangdong Province. Local governments need to build regional railroads, allowing talents and goods to flow between the area more efficiently, which will improve market integration, said Xi. The country will deepen the reform and opening-up of the Qianhai-Shenzhen-Hong Kong pilot cooperation zone and speed up the construction of a comprehensive national science center in the GBA to enhance coordination and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao. The GBA's platform should be fully utilized to attract more young talents from Hong Kong and Macao to come to the region to study, work and build a life, providing them with a deeper and wider level of communication and understanding of each other, the president continued. Xi welcomed greater participation of foreign countries in the reform, opening-up and development of China's special economic zones.  He said foreign participation has been indispensable in building the economic zones over the past 40 years, assisting in the creation of vast development opportunities and offering development benefits for foreign countries.Continuous reform and wider opening-up were key terms in President Xi's speech at the grand gathering, or as some experts pointed out, the southern Chinese city is the best example that shows the need for further opening-up.Read more:CGTN Opinion: Wider opening-up a key takeaway from Xi's speech"As China's first special economic zone and through the launch of a market-driven scheme that supported the attraction of a large number of foreign investments, the city has become instrumental in making China a prominent player in today's global economy," commented Matteo Giovannini, a Beijing-based finance professional. The city is home to various leading Chinese tech companies, including telecoms giant Huawei and technology conglomerate Tencent, two of the major companies that the U.S. has been putting pressure on in the most recently souring China-U.S. ties. Some say President Xi's trip "soothes their nerves.""Xi's visit to Shenzhen and the unveiling of the plan are aimed to encourage the development of the tech industry," Chief Economist for Hang Seng Bank Dan Wang told South China Morning Post.According to Giovannini, the trip also shines a light at China's continuous determination to open its arms to the international community."(His trip) represents an opportunity to emphasize China's uninterrupted commitment to further domestic integration and market opening-up to the rest of the world," he said.Since the Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire went into effect on Saturday, Armenia and Azerbaijan have exchanged recriminations, seriously violating the agreement that was meant to quell fighting over the disputed region.Azerbaijan's defense ministry said it was open to the temporary humanitarian ceasefire agreed in Moscow to exchange prisoners and bodies of those killed in the fighting. It insisted that Azeri forces were not violating the truce and accused Armenian forces of breaching the agreement by shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy, Aghdam and Terter. Armenia denied the accusation and said Azerbaijan had resumed military operations "supported by active artillery fire in the southern, northern, northeastern and eastern directions."Meantime, the death toll in the conflict continues to rise. Officials at the Nagorno-Karabakh region said 532 servicemen had been killed so far, seven since Monday. Azerbaijan has reported 42 Azeri civilian deaths and 206 others wounded since the fighting erupted on September 27. It has not disclosed military casualties.With sporadic shelling reported and daily recriminations regarding serious alleged violations of the Moscow-brokered agreement, the unrestrained battle has drawn warnings from international groups of a humanitarian crisis.Read more: Reported shelling haunts Nagorno-Karabakh, dims ceasefireMartin Schuepp, Eurasia regional director for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said his organization was in "continuous discussions" to facilitate the handover of detainees or bodies of those killed, but because of the security situation, the ICRC has not been possible to access all locations that might have been affected.Schuepp said the ICRC is appealing for another 10.1 million U.S. dollars to fund its humanitarian efforts in the region, as tens of thousands of people potentially need help in coming months.The conflict is also worsening the spread of COVID-19, World Health Organization spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told a United Nations briefing in Geneva.Armenia's new COVID-19 cases had doubled over the 14 days up to Monday, while new infections were up approximately 80 percent over the past week in Azerbaijan, Jasarevic told.The Russia-brokered truce is buckling despite mounting calls from world powers to halt the fighting. The Co-Chairs of the Minsk Group, a committee set up by the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, to help mediate in Nagorno-Karabakh released its latest statement on Tuesday, calling on the Armenian and Azeri leaders to "take immediate steps to execute in full the obligations of the sides according to the October 10 Moscow statement," to prevent catastrophic consequences for the region.The Co-Chairs reiterated that civilian casualties are unacceptable under any circumstances.The 11-member group is led by the U.S., Russia and France. Turkey is also a member but not involved in the Nagorno-Karabakh talks, though it has said it wants to join them.Read more: Unremitting Nagorno-Karabakh fighting dents fragile ceasefireTurkey and Armenia have each blamed the other for exacerbating the crisis around Nagorno-Karabakh, which is internationally recognized as part of Azerbaijan but governed and populated by ethnic Armenians.Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said he believed that only a change in Turkey's stance on Nagorno-Karabakh could prompt Azerbaijan to halt military action over the tiny region."I'm convinced that for as long as Turkey's position remains unchanged, Azerbaijan will not stop fighting," Pashinyan said. He accused Turkey of sabotaging the ceasefire and of trying to muscle its way into the wider South Caucasus region to further what he called its expansionist ambitions.Since fighting flared on September 27, Turkey has backed Azerbaijan strongly and said Armenian forces must leave the enclave.Turkey's Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Tuesday that the demands for a ceasefire were "reasonable" and the international community should ask Armenia to withdraw from Azeri territory.Turkey has been widely accused of dispatching pro-Ankara Syrian militia to assist Baku, a claim denied by both Turkey and Azerbaijan. According to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, 1,450 such fighters have gone to Azerbaijan including 250 in the last week alone.In a phone call on Monday with his Turkish counterpart, Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu raised the issue of Syrian fighters, and on Tuesday, Russia warned of the possible transfer of Syrian militants from the Middle East to Nagorno-Karabakh.Read more: Armenia's PM says ready for 'mutual concessions' with Azerbaijan on Nagorno-Karabakh(With input from agencies)Since the Nagorno-Karabakh ceasefire went into effect on Saturday, Armenia and Azerbaijan have exchanged recriminations, seriously violating the agreement that was meant to quell fighting over the disputed region.Azerbaijan's defense ministry said it was open to the temporary humanitarian ceasefire agreed in Moscow to exchange prisoners and bodies of those killed in the fighting.

They also claimed the probe is politically motivated. Previously, Trump's lawyers argued that the subpoena should be blocked because the president has immunity from prosecution. That argument was rejected three times, including by the Supreme Court in July. Ahead of the November 3 election, the New York Times reported last month that Trump paid just 750 U.S. dollars in federal income taxes in 2016 and 2017, a claim the president denies. U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday filed an emergency request to the Supreme Court to block his tax records from a New York grand jury subpoena, The Hill reports.The latest development marks the second time that the president has asked the court to stop Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance from accessing his tax records spanning eight years.The president's lawyers asked the court to block a federal appeals court ruling that said a subpoena of his tax records can proceed. "Irreparable harm will result from the denial of a stay," his lawyers wrote in their appeal to the Supreme Court. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance wants the returns, which cover 2011 to 2018, as part of an investigation into Trump's business affairs. The prosecutor is investigating possible tax evasion, insurance fraud and falsification of accounts. Vance is also seeking the records in connection with an alleged hush money payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels. U.S. presidents are not required by law to release details of their personal finances, but every U.S. leader since Richard Nixon has done so. Trump has broken with this tradition. His lawyers claim that the subpoena is too broad for the scope of the investigation.

The U.S. intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy," he said.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country, said the envoy."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he added."China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail," Geng added.The ambassador emphasized that China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process."Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," he noted.China has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, said the envoy."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council) country who has made such commitments," Geng noted."China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5," the ambassador stressed.The First Committee, also known as the Disarmament and International Security Committee, is one of six main committees of the UNGA. It deals with disarmament and international security matters.The committee meets every year in October for a 4-5 week session, after the UNGA General Debate. All 193 member states of the United Nations can attend.Statement of H. E. Mr. Geng Shuang, Head of the Chinese Delegation and Deputy Permanent Representative at the General Debate of the First Committee of the 75th Session of the UNGA(From Chinese Mission to the United Nations)2020/10/12Mr. Chairman,First of all, please allow me to extend, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, my congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as Chairman of the First Committee of the current session of the UN General Assembly. The Chinese delegation wishes to assure you and other delegations of its full support and cooperation to make this session of the committee a full success.Mr. Chairman,The global strategic security and arms control situation today is faced with the gravest challenge since the Cold War. To maintain its supremacy as the sole super power, the US has reverted to the Cold War mentality, hyped up major power competition and stoked major power confrontation. These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability.For the past years, to develop military capabilities without constraint, the US has continuously withdrawn from international treaties, sabotaging the multilateral and bilateral arms control and disarmament regime built up gradually after the WWII. The US is investing trillions of US dollars to modernize its nuclear Triad, developing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, and expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence. The US has also lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, and even discussed the resumption of nuclear tests. We urge the US to faithfully fulfill its special and primary responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, positively respond to Russia's appeal for the extension of the New START Treaty, and further substantially reduce its nuclear arsenal, so as to create conditions for other Nuclear Weapon States to join multilateral nuclear disarmament.The unrestrained development and deployment of a global missile defense system by the US as well as its attempts to deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, not only pose threats to China's security, but also undermine regional peace and security and disrupt global strategic stability. China is gravely concerned and urges the US to stop relevant deployments. Should the US continue to go down this path, China will take forceful countermeasures in defense of its own national interests when necessary.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. At present, the US has gone to extremes to shift responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, exercise double standards in violation of international law on non-proliferation issues, and manipulate the peaceful use of nuclear energy for political purposes, putting all the three pillars of the NPT under unprecedented strain. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of NPT, China calls on all parties to take this as an opportunity to reaffirm the treaty obligations and commitments made in the outcome documents of previous review conferences, and work for progress on the three pillars of NPT in a balanced manner. address the differences and disputes constructively, so as to achieve pragmatic outcomes at the 10th Review Conference.Recently the US named China as "the third largest nuclear power on earth", hyped up "nuclear arms race between the US, Russia and China" and proposed so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation". This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community. The US intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country. Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the US and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation. China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail.China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process. Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China has declared the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Non-Nuclear-Weapon States or Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones. China is the only P5 country who makes such commitments. China firmly abides by its commitments on the moratorium of nuclear tests, and supports the development of the verification mechanism of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). China supports negotiation for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of a comprehensive and balanced program of work in accordance with the mandate contained in the Shannon Report, and supports the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification. China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5.In the face of the increasingly complex and ominous international security landscape, the P5 should take proactive measures to manage differences, and work together to maintain global strategic stability. Since the Beijing Conference in January last year, the P5 have reached consensus on carrying out cooperation on strategic security issues including nuclear doctrines and policies, nuclear risk reduction, etc. China suggests that the P5 continue to strengthen dialogue on nuclear policies and doctrines, jointly reiterate that "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought", make a commitment not to target their nuclear weapons at any State, commit to the no-first-use of nuclear weapons unconditionally, and conclude legally binding international instruments on providing negative and positive security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States. We urge the US to abandon the policies of nuclear umbrella and nuclear sharing, withdraw all the nuclear weapons deployed overseas, stop the development and deployment of its global missile defense system, and play a due role in improving international and regional security environment.Mr. Chairman,The root cause of the current tensions related to the Iran nuclear issue is the US unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, re-imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran, and blocking other parties from fulfilling their obligations under the JCPOA. Having withdrawn from the JCPOA, the US has no right to trigger the Security Council snap-back mechanism, and its unilateral announcement on restoration of the UNSC sanctions against Iran has no legal validity whatsoever. It is imperative that all relevant parties resolve differences over the implementation of the JCPOA through dialogue and consultation within the framework of the Joint Commission focusing on restoring the balance of rights and obligations. China attaches high importance to the concerns of relevant parties over regional security issues, and advocates, on the premise of preserving the JCPOA, the establishment of an alternative multilateral dialogue platform with the purpose of building new consensus on maintaining peace and stability in the region.The US bears the responsibility for the deadlock of the DPRK-US dialogue regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. China urges the US to show sincerity and respond with concrete actions to the DPRK's legitimate concerns over security and development, so as to bring the Peninsular nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue. China is committed to upholding the denuclearization, peace and stability of the Peninsula, and to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation. China is firmly opposed to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction beyond the mandates of the UNSC resolutions and to any attempt by forces outside the region to use the Peninsula issue as an excuse to beef up military deployment in the region. China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.Mr. Chairman,The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has sounded the alarm on bio-security and highlighted the importance and urgency of strengthening global bio-security governance. In this connection, China wishes to make the following points. First, all parties should faithfully fulfill their due obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The international community is highly concerned with the US military's biological programs. We urge the US to act in an open, transparent and responsible manner and fully clarify its activities in numerous bio-labs overseas. Second, efforts should be made to resume negotiation for a verification protocol under BWC framework in order to put in place an effective international verification mechanism for the sake of safeguarding bio-security. We hope that such a decision can be made at next year's BWC Review Conference. We once again urge the US to stop impeding the resumption of negotiation. Third, it is necessary to set up a scientific advisory body within the framework of BWC and develop a voluntary code of conduct, in order to better regulate bio-research activities and promote the sound development of bio-technologies. Fourth, it is time to establish a fair and inclusive non-proliferation, export control and international cooperation regime under the framework of the BWC, remove discriminatory barriers, ensure developing countries' rights to the dividends of bio-technologies and jointly lift global bio-security to a new level.As the only possessor of chemical weapon stockpile, the US should earnestly fulfill its obligations under the CWC and expedite the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. In dealing with the Syrian chemical weapons issue, the provisions of CWC should be strictly observed and the authority of the Convention should be upheld. China strongly opposes political manipulation of the issue by a small number of countries for geopolitical purposes.Mr. Chairman,With the rapid development of digital economy, prominent risks associated with data security require global solutions. What is pressing now is to develop a set of international rules on data security that reflect the will and respect the interests of most countries on the basis of universal participation. China rejects attempts of the US and some other countries to politicize the issue of data security, elbow out countries with different views in the name of the so-called Clean Network program, and prey on enterprises of other countries under the pretext of security.China has recently put forward the Global Initiative on Data Security with a view to addressing data security risks and challenges, safeguarding global data and supply chain security, and promoting digital economic development and cooperation. China's initiative calls on all states to oppose using ICT activities to impair other States' critical infrastructure or steal important data, oppose abusing ICT to conduct mass surveillance against other States, desist from requesting domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in one's own territory, and ask ICT products and services providers not to install back-doors in their products and services. China's initiative aims to serve as a basis for international rules-making on data security, and is also a commitment of China to safeguarding global data security. China hopes that all parties could support this initiative, and we are open to good ideas and suggestions from all sides. China supports the work of the UN OEWG and UN GGE and hope that these processes will make further progress.The current security situation in outer space is increasingly challenging. In particular, the US has been pursuing a strategy for dominance in space, blatantly termed outer space as a new war-fighting domain, and has even established an independent Space Force and the Space Command. The US also plans to deploy missile defense system in outer space. These US moves accelerate the militarization and weaponization of outer space and therefore are the most prominent factors affecting outer space security. China urges the US to stop impeding international arms control process on outer space, and join international efforts for negotiation and conclusion of an international legal instrument based on the draft PPWT proposed by China and Russia, so as to fundamentally safeguard lasting peace and common security in outer space.The rapid development of the military application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may give rise to security, humanitarian, legal and ethical concerns. Paying high attention to these issues, China is supportive of having in-depth international discussions aimed at exploring effective measures to address the associated risks and ensuring that AI technology will benefit all mankind. China also supports continued in-depth discussions on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) within the framework of Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), with the purpose of negotiating a legally-binding international instrument.Mr. Chairman,China acceded to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) on 6 July this year. This is a significant step taken by China in its active efforts to promote global arms trade governance and to safeguard international and regional peace and security. This testifies to China's sincerity in upholding multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind. As a State Party to the ATT, China will faithfully fulfill its obligations, and work closely with all parties to promote the universality and effectiveness of the ATT. In this connection, China is ready to provide assistance to the developing countries within its capacity. China attaches great importance to African concerns about the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, and supports the African Union's initiative of "Silencing the Guns in Africa". To this end, China has provided USD 1.4 million through the United Nations Peace and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019. Standing ready to carry out further cooperation with the AU and African countries in this regard, China also calls upon the international community to provide needed assistance to Africa. Meanwhile, we urge all countries to stop arms sales to non-state actors, and refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign states through arms exports.Mr. Chairman,No matter how grave the international security situation may become, as long as we stay committed to upholding multilateralism, strengthening mutual trust and coordination centered on the UN, and building a community with a shared future for mankind, we would be able to make progress in international arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation. China is ready to join hands with other members of the international community to make unremitting efforts towards this end.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.A Chinese envoy said on Monday that asking China to participate in the "trilateral arms control negotiation" is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible.Geng Shuang, head of the Chinese delegation and deputy permanent representative of China to the United Nations, rejected the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" recently hyped up by the United States, in his statement delivered at the general debate of the First Committee of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).Geng pointed out that recently the United States named China as "the third largest nuclear power on Earth," hyped up "nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia and China" and proposed the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation.""This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community.

China is ready to join hands with other members of the international community to make unremitting efforts towards this end.Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi hailed Serbia as a "true and great friend" after meeting President Aleksandar Vucic and his leading ministers.Yang Jiechi also praised Serbia's economic development and said China would continue to encourage its companies to invest in Serbia and help to maintain its economic growth. The two nations have established an increasingly close relationship, with Serbia receiving large shipments of medical aid from China to help its fight against COVID-19.Now, Yang Jiechi says the focus of the two nations is to map out their future economic relationship, which he believes will benefit both parties.  "Regarding practical cooperation between China and Serbia, it is proven to be mutually beneficial," he said. "For instance, Smederevo steel mill is one of the examples of joint victory."In 2016, Serbia's only steel mill was saved from bankruptcy by the Chinese HBIS group. Thanks to that intervention, over 12,000 workers kept their jobs.However, amid uncertain progress in EU membership talks, Serbia is also courting the U.S. as it seeks international allies, placing it in the middle of tense relations between east and west.  Vucic recently visited Washington to sign an agreement with the U.S. vowing not to use 5G equipment from "suspicious sources." This came just weeks after the U.S. banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, claiming it could compromise national security.Vucic said: "We already had various pressures and we know it is not easy to maintain a friendship with China. But so far, Serbia [has been] successful in maintaining it. We'll keep our freedom of choices, and we'll continue to build a sincere friendship with the People's Republic of China."    Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi hailed Serbia as a "true and great friend" after meeting President Aleksandar Vucic and his leading ministers.Yang Jiechi also praised Serbia's economic development and said China would continue to encourage its companies to invest in Serbia and help to maintain its economic growth. The two nations have established an increasingly close relationship, with Serbia receiving large shipments of medical aid from China to help its fight against COVID-19.Now, Yang Jiechi says the focus of the two nations is to map out their future economic relationship, which he believes will benefit both parties.  "Regarding practical cooperation between China and Serbia, it is proven to be mutually beneficial," he said.

However, some high-profile cases involving violent crimes committed by underage youths in recent years have sparked a heated debate on the minimum age of criminal liability.Besides, statistics from the country's top procuratorate raised concerns over juvenile crimes. China saw a rebound in juvenile delinquency in recent years, according to a white paper issued by the SPP.From 2014 to 2017, the number of juvenile arrests examined by procuratorial agencies dropped from 56,276 to 42,413, later increasing by 5.87 percent and 7.51 percent in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The number of juvenile prosecutions increased 5.12 percent year on year in 2019.The most common juvenile crimes prosecuted were theft, robbery, intentional assault, affray, creating disturbances and rape, accounting for about 82.28 percent of the total, the white paper showed.During the five-day session, lawmakers will also review draft laws on biosecurity, export control, Yangtze River conservation, veterans support, personal information protection, and coast guard.They are also expected to deliberate a draft amendment to the Patent Law, a draft revision to the Law on the Protection of Minors, draft amendments to the National Flag Law and the National Emblem Law, a draft amendment to the Criminal Law and a draft revision to the Administrative Penalty Law.A draft amendment to the Electoral Law of the National People's Congress and Local People's Congresses, a draft revision to the Wildlife Protection Law and a draft revision to the National Defense Law will also be reviewed, according to the agenda.Protect personal informationAccording to a draft law on personal information protection submitted for the first reading at the Standing Committee of the NPC's ongoing session, personal consent should be obtained on the premise of prior notification for handling private information and individuals have the right to withdraw their consent.The draft added that when important issues are changed, personal consent shall be obtained again.No product or service shall be denied on the ground of personal disagreement, the draft noted.Before processing personal information, the data processor shall inform the individual of matters such as the identity and contact information of the processor, the purpose and method of processing, the type of personal information to be processed and the retention period, all in a conspicuous way and in clear and easy-to-understand language, the draft required.By March 2020, China had 900 million internet users, more than 4 million websites and more than 3 million applications, according to an introduction of the draft law.Personal information protection has become one of the most important and practical issues for everyday people, said the introduction.Strengthen guardian responsibility in protecting minorsChinese lawmakers on Tuesday also began reviewing a draft revision of the Law on the Protection of Minors, in a move to strengthen the responsibility of guardians in protecting minors.The latest draft of the revision adds stipulations that parents or guardians should provide the minors in their care with a safe family living environment and promptly eliminate potential safety hazards that could lead to electrical shock, scalding, falling or injury.Guardians should also take measures to prevent minors from being injured in traffic accidents, such as providing child safety seats and teaching minors to abide by traffic rules.The draft also makes provisions on protecting minors in cyberspace, stating that the processing of personal information of minors under the age of 14 will require the consent of their parents or other guardians. According to the draft, internet service providers should take measures such as disconnecting links to stop online bullying and the dissemination of information harmful to the physical and mental health of minors, and report to relevant authorities. (With input from Xinhua)Chinese lawmakers are mulling over lowering the minimum age at which a minor can be convicted to 12, in individual cases under specific circumstances.The proposal was made in a draft amendment to the Criminal Law, which was submitted Tuesday to the ongoing session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.The Standing Committee of the 13th NPC started its 22nd session Tuesday to review multiple draft laws and law revisions.If a juvenile, who has reached the age of 12 but is under 14, commits intentional homicide or inflicts an injury that leads to death under flagrant circumstances, he or she shall bear criminal responsibility upon attestation and approval of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP), according to the draft.Currently, minors under the age of 14 do not bear any criminal responsibility in China.

It's one of few key states in the age of mass mail-in voting likely to report on November 3, and if Biden wins its 29 Electoral College votes, the election will be as good as over.CGTN analysis of public polling indicates the former vice president is up by 3.4 points in Florida and over eight points nationally, with female, older and suburban voters moving towards him. Biden has built up a lead with seniors, the most reliable voting bloc, as the pandemic has progressed.While the first presidential debate looks to have hurt Trump in the polls, the only lasting impact from the vice-presidential clash between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Mike Pence is the slew of memes that emerged after a fly perched for two minutes on the vice president's head.Snap polls suggested Harris was the winner of a low-key debate which was quickly forgotten as the president returned to center stage. Whether Biden and Trump will square up again in person remains unclear â the president has refused to debate virtually and so the second event, scheduled for this week, has been cancelled.The third planned debate, now the second, is still due to go ahead on October 22 and could be the final opportunity for Trump to try to knock the risk-averse Biden campaign off course.Video: Wang Zengzheng and Zhou TingyuScript: John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.With three weeks until election day in the United States more than 10 million Americans have already voted and CGTN analysis suggests Joe Biden has pulled further ahead of Donald Trump in the national polls.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionHere are the highlights from the past seven days.Trump returned to the White House after his COVID-19 hospitalization, released a series of videos, conducted phone or recorded interviews with Fox News, addressed a crowd on the South Lawn on Saturday, and then got into a spat with Anthony Fauci before returning to the campaign trail in Florida on Monday.The president, desperate to return to in-person events, insisted he was "immune" from the virus on Sunday in a tweet which was flagged for spreading "misleading and potentially harmful information" as the U.S. continued to report over 40,000 new COVID-19 cases per day.Confirmation of a negative test did not come until Trump was en route to Monday's rally, the first of a series of swing state campaign stops â Axios reported that the Republican wants to hold a rally every day until November 3.Polling numbers for Trump have gone from bad to worse since the first presidential debate and his COVID-19 diagnosis.Seemingly low on funds, the president's campaign is cutting advertising spending and hoping for a free media boost from rallies just as Biden, flush with cash, broadens his own ad buys: the Democrat splashed out $40 million to Trump's $23 million over the past week.Florida is yet again shaping up to be the race to watch.

negotiation" with the U.S. and Russia as the U.S. intends to avoid its own responsibility in nuclear disarmament.  The U.S. named China "the third largest nuclear power on Earth," hyped up the "nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia and China" and proposed the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation," which is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community, said Geng, the head of the Chinese delegation and deputy permanent representative of China to the United Nations.Speaking during the general debate of the First Committee of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), Geng called the trilateral arms control talks "coercion" and "blackmail," saying China will never be part of such negotiation. China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in a nuclear arms race with any other country, Geng said."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he continued.But the Chinese representative said China is pursuing its responsibility to push forward nuclear disarmament.China signed the UN-led Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) spurned by the U.S. in July, Geng noted, saying it's a "significant" step taken by his country.The ATT regulates a 70 billion-U.S.-dollar global cross-border trade in conventional arms and seeks to keep weapons out of the hands of human rights abusers.Then-U.S. President Barack Obama's administration signed it, but it was opposed by the National Rifle Association and never ratified by the U.S. Senate.In July 2019, the United States told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that Washington did not intend to become a party to the treaty and that it had no legal obligations from its 2013 signature.Naming the United States, Geng said the U.S. is reverted to the Cold War mentality and launched acts of unilateralism and confrontation."These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability."Geng noted that China has provided $1.4 million through the United Nations Peace and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019 to help reduce illicit trafficking of small weapons in African countries.China also has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, Geng said."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council)

He said earlier this year that China must stick to the path of self-reliance as international unilateralism and trade protectionism was rising."Regardless of the past, present and future, we must put the development of the country and the nation on the basis of our own strength, adhere to national self-esteem and self-confidence and unswervingly walk our own path," said Xi.But that doesn't mean the doors to China will close as Xi stressed at last year's China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, "At a new historical starting point, China will open its door only wider to the world."Read more: Xi's CIIE speech: China will open its door only widerIn recent years the U.S. has put extreme pressure so as to contain the rise of Chinese tech firms, through all-out efforts to cut chips supply to such companies as Huawei and SMIC, and enforce bans on apps like TikTok and WeChat. However, analysts said Washington's restrictions have rather pushed China onto a more independent approach on high technologies.More than 8.8 million Americans have already voted in the U.S. presidential election.Based off data released by states that have started accepting ballots, more registered Democrats are voting early compared to Republicans.Officials from both parties say Democrats are far more eager to vote early to avoid possibly exposing themselves to the virus at Election Day polling sites. Many Republicans have followed the lead of President Donald Trump, who has regularly castigated voting by mail, while the party's leadership in some states has offered mixed messages about when supporters should vote.While millions of people are choosing to vote by mail this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, others are opting for in-person early voting.Recent controversies including criticism by the Trump administration over the U.S. Postal Service and doubts about the acceptance of ballots are leading some to head to the polls in-person. In Virginia, early voting began September 28th. Officials say election workers are receiving about 2,000 mail-in ballots per day and hundreds are lining up to vote in-person. More than 890,000 people have already cast ballots by voting in person, by mail or drop box."We're probably looking at three times the rate for early voting that we saw in 2016," said Gary D. Scott, the head of the office of elections in Fairfax County, to the Washington Post."I want to make sure that my ballot didn't get torn up, that it didn't get thrown away, and that there wasn't anything going on at the polls that shouldn't be going on there," Linda Cottrell told the Los Angeles Times.Early voting began October 7th in Arizona. The LA Times reports, fear was a common factor among reasons why people decided to vote early. Voters were worried their mail-in ballots wouldnât arrive on time, get lost or election officials would stop counting.In Georgia, early in-person voting began Monday. Thousands of people turned out in long lines. Voters in Fulton County faced technical glitches that temporarily stopped voting but officials were able to clear the lines by mid-morning.CNN reports the state of Ohio has received almost 2.2 million ballot requests... double those from early October 2016.Considering millions have already cast their votes early, experts predict a record turnout for the election. National opinion polls show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the lead over Trump. But as officials brace for an influx of mail-in ballots compared to previous elections, they are also warning, Americans might not have a final result by the end of the night on November 3rd. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

Pubs and bars will close temporarily and socializing prohibited indoors, but universities and retail shops will stay open.High level measures will be applied to Manchester and Nottinghamshire, meaning socializing indoors will be banned and the rule of six applied in outdoor settings, but pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open, as across the rest of the country, until 10 p.m.  Those areas placed on the medium tier will continue to follow national guidelines, with bars and pubs closing at 10 p.m. and the rule of six applied outdoors.The UK government response is for England only, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland implementing their own strategies to deal with the pandemic.Johnson says the new system is designed to avoid another national lockdown, which he says would cause long-term economic damage."This is not how we want to live our lives," he said. "But it is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic costs of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."  Johnson added: "The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country. I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed."The prime minister and his scientific advisers will continue to monitor the number of cases in each area, which could lead to an increasing number of towns and cities facing the most severe measures.England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained why cases of COVID-19 have risen so sharply the north of England compared with the rest of the country. "The epidemic this time has clearly picked up pace in the north of England earlier than it did in the first wave and that almost certainly relates to the fact that disease levels in the north never dropped, and certainly in the northwest, they never dropped as far as they dropped in the summer as they did in the south."Johnson also announced a further economic package would be introduced to replace the furlough scheme, which comes to an end at the end of this month. The support will cover two-thirds of the wages for employees of businesses forced to close as a result of the new virus restrictions.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a new three-level COVID-19 alert system across England as cases continue to rise across the country.Infection rates have quadrupled in England in the past month, and hospital admissions have doubled. The new system will apply localized measures of varying severity to the worst-hit areas of the country, with regions placed into one of three levels â medium, high or very high. Liverpool has been placed in the very high level with measures set to be imposed from Wednesday.

establishing a republic following the abrupt departure abroad of former King Juan Carlos amid a cloud of scandal, according to an opinion poll.The 82-year-old former monarch has been living in the United Arab Emirates since he left Spain in August to avoid causing further embarrassment to his son, King Felipe VI.Of the respondents, 40.9 percent said they preferred a republic, while 34.9 percent said they supported the royal family and 24.2 percent said they did not know, according to the survey for the Platform for Independent Media, a group of mainly left-wing media.The poll, which questioned 3,000 people, also found 48 percent want a referendum on the monarchy, which under Spain's constitution is the only way to decide the fate of the institution, while 25 percent were opposed and 16.1 percent did not know.  A poll published in August for the pro-monarchy ABC newspaper found 33.5 percent favouring a republic and 56 percent the monarchy, while six percent did not know and 4.1 percent were indifferent.While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos could become a target in two inquiries in Spain and Switzerland into alleged corruption associated with a $9.9 billion, high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms.Spain's supreme court prosecutor is considering whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to formally involve Juan Carlos.The former king has not commented publicly but his lawyer Javier Sanchez has said he is at the disposition of prosecutors if necessary.  The latest survey, published on the National Day public holiday when King Felipe will lead a reduced celebration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was commissioned after the government's Centre for Sociological Investigations declined to question Spaniards about the monarchy in its most recent poll.Defence Minister Margarita Robles said the monarchy was an "essential part of the constitutional pact," speaking in an interview published on Monday in ABC.Nobel laureate Maria Vargas Llosa was among 183 high-profile supporters of the monarchy who posted a video on YouTube on Sunday in support of King Felipe.More than 40 percent of Spaniards support

Reuters reported on Wednesday, though the Chinese mainland has repeatedly warned the U.S. to stop the deal.Citing Pentagon, Reuters said the U.S. State Department had approved the potential sale of three weapons systems to Taiwan authorities, including sensors, missiles and artillery that could have a total value of $1.8 billion.Last week, the White House said they were moving forward with five separate sales of sophisticated military equipment to the island with a total value of around $5 billion.Among other weapons systems, Wednesday's formal notifications to Congress by the State Department were for 11 truck-based rocket launchers made by Lockheed Martin Corp, called a High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS), for an estimated cost of $436.1 million.The notifications also covered 135 AGM-84H Standoff Land Attack Missile Expanded Response (SLAM-ER) Missiles and related equipment made by Boeing Co, for an estimated $1 billion, and six MS-110 Recce external sensor pods made by Collins Aerospace for jets, at an estimated cost of $367.2 million.Further congressional notifications are expected to follow Wednesday's, including drones made by General Atomics and land-based Harpoon anti-ship missiles made by Boeing to serve as coastal defense cruise missiles.Sources have said the 100 cruise missiles stations and 400 missiles would have a cost of about $2 billion.The formal notification gives Congress 30 days to object to any sales, but Reuters said this is unlikely given broad bipartisan support for Taiwan.China has repeatedly warned the U.S. not to move forward the arms sales as the two countries' relations are under strain since the COVID-19 pandemic.Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said last week that U.S. arms sales to China's Taiwan region severely damaged China's sovereignty and security interests.The United States is seriously violating the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, especially the August 17 communique, by selling arms to Taiwan, thereby seriously interfering in China's internal affairs, Zhao said in a daily briefing on October 13.He urged Washington to cancel the planned sales and warned that China would make a legitimate and necessary response according to how the situation develops.The U.S. State Department has formally notified the Congress of the planned

on Wednesday the State Department was designating six more China-based media companies in the U.S. as foreign missions, despite China's opposition.Previously in June, the U.S. had announced to treat four major Chinese media outlets as foreign embassies.Following the move, China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) had criticized Washington's actions, calling them further proof of the U.S.'s political oppression of the Chinese media."We strongly urge the U.S. to discard the Cold War mentality and ideological bias, and immediately stop and correct these damaging and harmful actions," MOFA spokesperson Zhao Lijian had said."The US has gone too far," Editor-in-Chief of Global Times Hu Xijin tweeted following the announcement.

The officer went astray as he responded to a request from herders to help them search for yaks late Sunday.It started at the 38th parallel north.On June 25, 1950, the Korean War broke out between the Republic of Korea (ROK) and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).Within two days, the U.S. government ordered troops to invade the DPRK and sent its Seventh Fleet into China's Taiwan Straits.On July 7, the United States manipulated the United Nations (UN) Security Council to adopt a resolution on dispatching a UN force that it led to the Korean Peninsula. The United States mobilized a third of its army, half of its navy and a fifth of its air force to join the war. Its peak troop strength topped 300,000.On September 15, the U.S. forces conducted the Incheon Landing, forcing the DPRK forces to retreat. Meanwhile, U.S. military planes intruded into China's airspace, bombing airports and infrastructure along its border with the DPRK.Do not step across the 38th parallel, China repeatedly cautioned. But the United States ignored the warning. Its army poured across the line on October 7 and pressed on towards the Sino-Korean border.The next day, at a time when China's national security was threatened and upon receiving then DPRK leader Kim Il Sung's urgent request for aid, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) was formed.On October 19, the CPV crossed the Yalu River to fight together with the DPRK army.It could have been a one-sided war. In 1950, China's industrial and agricultural output was 1/12 of the U.S. total, while its steel output 1/144 of the U.S. total.During the war, the U.S. military used all the latest weapons (other than nuclear), while the CPV mainly relied on infantry and limited artillery. The two sides were heavily mismatched in weapons, equipment, logistics and food supplies. But what happened next was beyond expectation.On October 25, the CPV launched the first battle, driving back the enemy forces to the Chongchon River.On November 7, the second battle started, ending with the U.S.-led army retreating to the south of the 38th parallel.Up to June 1951, the CPV launched five major battles in seven months that inflicted heavy losses on the UN force led by the United States, and essentially fixed the front around the 38th parallel.On July 10, 1951, the first truce talks began at Kaesong, near the 38th parallel.For the next two years, the Korean War continued as a stalemate â both negotiations and combat went on.On October 14, 1952, the Battle of Triangle Hill began. It was a hill covering 3.7 square kilometers.The United States had planned to seize the area with two battalions in five days at the expense of 200 casualties â but it ultimately cost 60,000 troops, 43 days and 25,000 casualties before the battle ended.Over 11,000 CPV soldiers were wounded or killed in the battle.On July 27, 1953, the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in the village of Panmunjom, ending the 33-month War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.According to China's official release, more than 1.093 million enemy combatants were killed, wounded or captured. In the United States, the Korean War has been called "the Forgotten War."To protect their motherland, a total of 2.9 million CPV soldiers entered the battlefield and 197,653 sacrificed their lives, according to the latest data. For China, history will never be forgotten, and the heroes will be remembered.Managing editor: Hu YiweiVideo editor: Yu QianhuiAnimation &amp; graphics: Xu Qianyun, Chen Yuyang, Yin YatingVoiceover: Zeng ZiyiCopy editor: John GoodrichChief editor: Wang DeweiProducer: Dang ZhengManaging director: Mei YanSeventy years ago, the Chinese People's Volunteers (CPV) crossed the Yalu River and fought alongside the army of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) against the Republic of Korea (ROK) and U.S.-led UN forces.A total of 2.9 million CPV soldiers entered the battlefield, 197,653 of whom sacrificed their lives in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953 Korean War).As 2020 marks the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War, here are five facts you may not know about the conflict:1. China, U.S. never officially declared warNeither China nor the United States officially engaged in the conflict as nation states: China sent aâvolunteerâ force and the U.S. dominated and led UN forces. On June 27, 1950, two days after the war in Korean Peninsula broke out, U.S. President Harry Truman ordered navy and air force to intervene and the U.S. Navy's 7th Fleet into the Taiwan Strait. Three days later he approved the use of ground forces on the Korean Peninsula.The U.S. Constitution states that Congress should decide when and where the country should go to a war. However, Truman's order was made without congressional approval, and war was never officially declared.Truman later argued a United Nations resolution gave him authority, but he ordered armed forces to the peninsula before the UN acted and before an agreement with the UN was reached.China sent forces under the banner of "volunteers" following a request for help from the DPRK and to protect China's national sovereignty, security and interests.Chairman Mao Zedong on October 8, 1950 issued an order saying, "In order to assist the Korean people's war of liberation against the attacks of U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, thereby safeguarding the interests of the people of Korea, China and the other countries in the East, I hereby order to change the Northeastern Border Defense Army into the CPV."On October 19, 1950, as requested by the DPRK, CPV forces crossed the Yalu River to aid the DPRK's fight.The CPV launched its first battle on October 25 against a battalion of Syngman Rhee's troops. In 1951, the CPC Central Committee decided to commemorate the war annually on that date.2. Misperception between China and the U.SThe Chinese government repeatedly cautioned that if U.S. forces crossed the 38th parallel China would not sit idle, but the U.S. disregarded the warning, seeing it as only diplomatic parlance.After the U.S.-led UN forces landed at Inchon, 160 kilometers south of the 38th parallel, Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai publicly warned on September 30, 1950 that, "The Chinese people enthusiastically love peace, but in order to defend peace they never have been and never will be afraid to oppose aggressive war.""The Chinese people absolutely will not tolerate foreign aggression, nor will they supinely tolerate seeing their neighbors being savagely invaded by imperialists," he added.On October 1, 1950, DPRK leader Kim Il Sung sent a telegram to Mao reporting the grim picture on the battlefield and requesting military aid from China.Since diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. had not been established, Indian Ambassador Kavalam Madhava Panikkar acted as a communication channel between the two camps.On October 2, Zhou formally notified Panikkar that if the U.S. crossed the 38th parallel, China would act. In Washington, Secretary of State Dean Acheson dismissed the warning as the "mere vaporings of a panicky Panikkar."In a document titled "Two Strategic Intelligence Mistakes in Korea, 1950," the CIA admitted U.S. intelligence erred: it believed that China, with limited military and economic capability, would not follow through on its warnings.U.S. forces crossed the 38th Parallel on October 7, and the CPV launched its first battle on October 25.3. Soviet Union sent air supportDeclassified documents from Russia show the Soviet Union was closely involved in the Korean War.In addition to diplomatic and logistical support, the Soviet Union sent air forces to the war from early November 1950. In order to avoid the appearance of direct military clashes with the U.S., Soviet pilots wore CPV uniforms and their aircraft carried CPV or DPRK markings.Records from the Soviet 64th Fighter Aviation Corps claim that from November 1950 till July 1953, the Soviets shot down 1,309 U.S. planes.The Soviet Union provided the CPV with enormous supplies of weapons, equipment and ammunition. China's military debt to the Soviet Union reached 3 billion yuan during the war.4. Japan was a major beneficiary Japan, which didn't send troops to the battlefield, was a major economic beneficiary during the Korean War. U.S. troops were stationed in Japan, so military goods were often purchased from Japanese companies. These companies received more than $3.5 billion over the three years of the conflict. Japan's production increased by nearly 70 percent and military procurement peaked at a level equivalent to seven percent of Japan's gross national product in 1953. By the time the three-year war ended in a truce, Japan's gross domestic product had returned to pre-World War II levels.  5. A never-ending war The Korean Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953, but a peace treaty is yet to be inked. So although hostilities ceased in 1953, the war has not formally ended. "We cannot commemorate the Korean War in a genuine manner yet. That is because the war has yet to come to an end," ROK President Moon Jae-in said in June when attending a ceremony commemorating the 70th anniversary of the outbreak of the Korean War. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader, Kim Jong Un, paid tribute to Chinese People's Volunteers(CPV) martyrs in commemoration of the 70th anniversary of the CPV army entering the DPRK during the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, local media reported.The Korean Central News Agency(KCNA) reported on Thursday that Kim, together with DPRK officials, visited CPV's martyrs tower at the cemetery for martyrs of the CPV in South Pyongan Province. A flower basket was presented in Kim's name.Kim Jong Un said that although it has been 70 years since the war, the people of DPRK still remember the heroic achievements of the CPV in resisting U.S. aggression and selflessly supporting the DPRK under extremely difficult circumstances.He said that the country will never forget the CPV soldiers' noble spirit of selflessness as they risked their lives and made sacrifices to conquer invasion of the forces of imperialism.No matter how much time passes and generations change, the significance of the great victory achieved by the two countries in the war created a link between the military and the people that remains unchanged, the DPRK leader said.According to the KCNA, Kim also visited the Friendship Tower in Pyongyang on Wednesday, presenting a flower basket at the tower.The Friendship Tower was built on October 25, 1959 to commemorate the CPV sacrifice in the war.(Cover: The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Un pays tribute to martyrs of Chinese People's Volunteers(CPV) commemorating the 70th anniversary of the CPV army entering the DPRK in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea. /CCTV)There are two weeks to go until election day in the United States, 30 million Americans have already voted and Donald Trump and Joe Biden have spent the past seven days on the campaign trail in the critical swing states that will decide who wins the race for the White House.Election 2020: How is a U.S. president elected?Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionHere's what you might have missed over the past week.Biden has a stable polling advantage over Trump, more than eight points nationally according to CGTN analysis and by slightly smaller margins in the battlegrounds, but while the Democrat's lead has been steady for weeks, his campaign is warning against complacency."The very searing truth is that Donald Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire," Biden's campaign manager cautioned in a memo to supporters on Saturday.Trump has intensified his schedule, addressing rallies across the country â including Nevada, which he only narrowly lost in 2016 â with mainly mask-less crowds sitting shoulder to shoulder even as COVID-19 cases in the U.S. are on the rise in 48 of the 50 states and polls suggest a majority of Americans disapprove of his handling of the pandemic. The president encouraged "lock her up" chants towards Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer â the subject of a recent kidnapping plot â again insulted infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci and engaged in Twitter spats with fellow Republicans up for reelection including Senator Ben Sasse, who in a call to his Nebraska constituents warned of a "Republican bloodbath in the Senate."There are doubts over whether rallies to existing supporters are the best use of resources for a campaign that is running far behind in fundraising: in September Biden and his affiliates raked in $383 million, a huge $135 million more than Trump's $248 million.Whereas Trump's rallies led to free media worth tens of millions of dollars in 2016, in this cycle â even though they continue to dominate local news in key areas and aid data collection â they generally only appear on national news in a negative light, reinforcing views of his handling of the pandemic or amplifying the kind of rhetoric which has turned off older voters and suburban women.Biden, whose running mate Kamala Harris was off the campaign trail for several days after a senior aide tested positive for COVID-19, also surprised many by winning the TV ratings war as the candidates took part in competing town hall events last week.But eyes now turn to the last presidential debate, with Trump already telling supporters that the moderator, NBC News' Kristen Welker, is "terrible and unfair" and the campaigns arguing over the topics due for discussion on Thursday evening.Trump is scheduled to continue his rallies through the week, while Biden is huddling down with advisers preparing for the final mass viewership event of the election â a debate where fireworks are expected, as the president tries to knock his challenger out of his comfort zone and the Democrat aims to keep things steady with the clocking ticking ever closer to November 3.Video: Wang Zengzheng and Zhou TingyuScript: John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.Editor's note: The story is part of our continuing World Factory series, which delves into the trajectory of China's economic growth amid a changing geopolitical landscape, the pandemic and a global economic recession. Here are the first, second and third stories. The trade war and the pandemic have fueled speculation about a potential wave of offshoring from China.But Trueanalog Strictly OEM, a high-end audio speaker factory based in Guangzhou, continues to operate in China. And it has no plans to leave, said Philip Richardson, the factory's American owner. The factory manufactures loudspeakers for the world's top speaker brands, e.g. Avantone, and most of its products are exported to Europe and the U.S. The facility employs around 20 workers and has found its niche, targeting the premium market segment â home stereo speakers or headphones with a price tag over $1,000. "I don't know a single American speaker factory that moved outside of China. This is where the greatest resources of parts are... right here," said Richardson. China dominates the production of raw materials required to make speakers, including magnet, copper, aluminum and low carbon steel, he added. The vertical integration of Chinese supply chains is a major reason why little production has gone offshore, according to Emily Jiang, purchasing manager of Triangle, a French high-end speaker manufacturer. Most parts are sourced from the Yangtze River Delta Region and the Pearl River Delta Region, and can be easily shipped to manufacturers. "It is so easy to procure parts that go into speakers domestically," she noted, "which is why we won't go to Southeast Asian countries where many still depend on China for the supply of parts." China has become the world's manufacturing powerhouse over the past two decades. In 2010, the value created in China by manufacturing surpassed the U.S., making it the largest manufacturer in the world, according to data from the World Bank. But China's labor-cost advantage is disappearing. Wages have gone up 15 to 20 percent per year, shrinking the total cost advantage of doing businesses in China. Amid the rising labor cost, some low-end manufacturing, like garment production, has moved to Southeast Asia. But what has made China a vital manufacturing hub is not just cheap labor, but a skilled workforce, especially in fields which involve intricate hand work. Speaker production is still a labor-intensive industry, according to Richardson. For example, a worker needs to install the wires on a loudspeaker coin, a task that is impossible for robots to handle, at least for now."It is in the DNA of Chinese workers to work hard and do a good job," said Richardson. Contrary to conventional belief that factories in China are stuffed by young laborers, many workers at Trueanalog are over the age of 30 and have been at the factory for more than five years. For Richardson, his workers are integral to the success of his businesses. At the factory, workers are allowed to take a 10-minute break every two hours, and follow a schedule of five days a week, eight hours per day. "This work schedule is rare in Chinese OEM factories," said a female worker on the production line, who is from landlocked Sichuan Province.The pandemic dealt a heavy blow to the global supply chain. Global manufacturing output declined in the second quarter by 11.2 percent in a year-over-year comparison, following a drop by six percent in the previous quarter, according to data from the United Nations Industrial Development Organization. But China's manufacturing PMI has remained in expansion territory since February this year, and its exports have surged since June. Richardson's factory has been working around the clock to meet that surging demand. The pandemic has given him a boost since April, he said. Because consumers are spending more time at home, sales have gone up 30 percent for Trueanalog. China's total export of speakers also jumped in recent months, with the figures for July and August higher than in the same months last year, according to data from the General Administration of Customs. The pandemic, in a way, has highlighted countries' reliance on China for the supply chain. Some countries have tried to lure businesses back to their home countries in the post-pandemic world. U.S. President Donald Trump, for example, has called for American companies to bring manufacturing back to the U.S., but that does not seem to be happening "en masse." According to a survey done by the American Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai, which included responses from 340 companies, 92 percent of them said they had no plans to move out of China, and only 5.1 percent of companies with global revenues over 500 million U.S. dollars planned to leave. "It is simply too expensive to manufacture in the U.S.," said Richardson. While it costs companies around $75 per hour to employ an American worker, it takes only $30 per day ($3.75 per hour) to hire a skilled Chinese worker in the speaker production industry. Even if companies ship the semi-products from China and assemble them in the U.S., it would still be too costly, he added. He was once approached by an American customer to make three-inch drivers in the U.S. But after doing a cost analysis, he realized that it would cost American manufacturers an additional $20 per speaker to assemble them in the U.S. "For people saying China is taking away jobs, noâ¦.It is simply a matter of economics," he noted. Writer: Yu Jing Videographer: Shen LanglangVideo editors: Amy Chen, Yu Jing Data editor: Hu YiweiCover image: Pan YufeiOn Saturday, U.S. President Donald Trump nominated conservative federal appellate Judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died from complications of pancreatic cancer earlier this month."She is a woman of unparalleled achievement, towering intellect, sterling credentials, and unyielding loyalty to the Constitution," Trump said of Barrett from the White House Rose Garden."This should be a straightforward and prompt confirmation."The announcement came at a time when nearly six in 10 Americans say the president elected in November should be the one to fill the Supreme Court vacancy, according to a CNN poll conducted by SSRS. Meanwhile, 44 percent of respondents think the current court is "about right" in terms of ideological leanings, while 34 percent think it is too conservative and 22% too liberal, according to the same poll.If confirmed after Senate hearings in mid-October, Barrett would bring the number of conservative justices to six on the nine-member court â a dramatic turn to the right that could have far-reaching impact on the country's judicial and political development long after President Trump exits the White House.With the Republicans holding a 53-47 advantage in the Senate, Trump appears to have a clear path to having his third Supreme Court pick confirmed, after Neil Gorsuch in 2017 and Brett Kavanaugh in 2018.What does a 6-3 court means?Trump's timely nomination has set off media speculation about unwinding decades of liberal progress on a wide range of issues from voting to abortion, and bringing American jurisprudence back decades.If Barrett joins, she would be the sixth Catholic on the bench and the fifth woman to do so in the court's 231-year history.Since the end of World War II, the U.S. Supreme Court has kept a balance of 5-4, with the majority being liberal or conservative. The intricate balance has kept the court from being one-sided, since one vote from the other camp could help tip the court's decision to its favor. However, a 6-3 bench could mean the conservatives can afford to lose one vote and still prevail.With a dominant majority and hence a more predictable outcome, the conservative camp â Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh with the addition of Amy Coney Barrett â will also be more emboldened to direct America's highest court to take on controversial cases which have been sidestepped in the past when the outcome was less clear with a 5-4 bench.Appointed by President George W. Bush in 2005, the generally conservative Chief Justice John G. Roberts has functioned as a swing vote on some key occasions, including siding with his liberal colleagues to uphold the Affordable Care Act in 2012. Now, the only three liberal justices would have to pursue Roberts plus another conservative Justice in order to come up on top in any decision. A 6-3 conservative bench would likely loosen restrictions on fire arms which many Republicans see as an infringement on the Second Amendment. Besides, the advancement of LGBT rights in recent decades would also likely experience significant challenges as religious rights expands. However, no issue is as divisive as abortion.As a candidate, Trump has promised to overturn Roe v. Wade , the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark 1973 decision which legalized abortion in the U.S. With a third Trump justice, it is likely that this campaign promise could materialize.Who is Barrett?During her nomination speech, Barrett praised the legacy left behind by Justice Ginsburg for having "smashed" the glass ceiling for women in the legal profession. However, carrying a proven conservative record voting record on a range of issues including gun rights and abortion, she will likely take the opposite end of the ideological spectrum as the woman she's set to replace."A judge must apply the law as written," she said. "Judges are not policy makers."The statement is an homage to the legal principle known as originalism which argues the constitution should be interpreted based on the original intent of the authors at the time it was ratified. This concept was evangelized by the giant of conservative jurisprudence, Justice Antonin Scalia whom Barrett clerked for from 1998 to 1999.While Scalia's approach to the constitution has sometimes led him to liberal conclusions, Barrett's legal opinions have been more influenced by her lifelong devotion to Catholicism.During her teaching career at Notre Dame, she often invoked God in articles and speeches, according to the Associated Press. In a 2006 address, she encouraged graduating law students to see their careers as a means to "building the kingdom of God."Barrett was born in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1972. Her father worked as an attorney for Shell Oil Company and her mother a high school French teacher. She attended Notre Dame Law School on a full-tuition scholarship and graduated with honors. She is also mom to seven children. Editor's note: THIS IS CHINA is an original animated series CGTN Digital presents for the Two Sessions. Each episode focuses on the most popular topics and trends in China, recounting how China's economy and society, guided by government policies, have evolved in the new era.  The key term in this episode: The Cashless Era.Spending a day without cash or bank cards is perfectly unremarkable in China.More than three-quarters of Chinese people were using digital payment in preference to cash by 2017 and the number has continued to rise. Eighty-six percent now use mobile payment, whether to pay utility bills, travel short or long distances, make appointments at hospital or go grocery shopping. The growth in use of digital payment has been supported by the development of advanced technologies. According to the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT), the number of 4G base stations in China totaled 5.44 million in 2019 â more than half of the world's total. With the innovation of the QR code, online and offline payments have been further combined.Read more:China's QR code industry to be worth multi-trillions of yuan by 2025Common Destiny: 'QR code planters' bring cashless payment to the worldMobile payment platforms WeChat Pay and Alipay have also contributed to the development of the cashless society in China.In recent years, Bluetooth payment, biometric payment, sonic payment, AR/VR payment and other emerging payment methods have been launched.Meanwhile, the number of 5G base stations in use nationwide has exceeded 200,000 according to the latest data from the MIIT, which means that China has hit the "fast-forward" button on the construction of Internet infrastructure.The proportion of 5G users in China is expected to increase to nearly 50 percent by 2025, and 5G commercialization will create more possibilities for the growth of the cashless era.Read more:5G Phones will outsell 4G by 2023China leads global race in key 5G patents: reportThe country's internet availability rate has increased by 3.8 percentage points year on year to 59.6 percent, according to the 43rd statistical report from the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC), further laying the foundation for a high rate of online payment users.The central bank and other financial authorities have announced they want to spread the benefits of going cashless to the four out of 10 people in China who still live in rural areas. According to the central bank, 66.5 percent of people in rural areas were already using digital payments by 2017.Read more:China's mobile payment enters overseas marketsAlipay's worldwide users exceed 1 billionIn fact, mobile payment also helps the sharing economy, e-retailing, digital governance, education and healthcare as well as other emerging technologies, business fields and models, such as smart governance, smart hospitals, automated payment and other industrial applications.The merits and convenience of a cashless society are significant, but concerns over safety and privacy also need to be addressed. And the risk that a cashless society could marginalize older and less tech-savvy spenders and the less well-off also need to be considered.Read more:China's central bank regulates forced cashless payment Editor: Duan FengyuanCopy Editor: John GoodrichChief Editor: Chen RanSenior Consultant: Dr. Xia JixuanProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiAn Israeli delegation made a visit to Sudan on Wednesday to discuss normalizing ties, Israeli public broadcaster Kan radio said, as a minister predicted a possible diplomatic breakthrough between the two countries.Israeli Intelligence Minister Eli Cohen told Israel's media that he believed Israel was "very close to normalizing ties with Sudan."Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office and the Israeli Foreign Ministry declined to comment when asked about prospects for a breakthrough with Sudan. In a foreign-policy flourish ahead of his re-election bid, top aides to U.S. President Donald Trump this week escorted Israeli delegates to Bahrain and UAE delegates to Israel, cementing Israel's new, U.S.-brokered relations with the Gulf states.U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Wednesday that the United States had begun the process of removing Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism and was also working "diligently" to get Khartoum to recognize Israel.Pompeo stopped short of saying Sudan's removal would be linked to whether it would agree to normalize relations with Israel.

"With no single piece of evidence, they (Sweden) are just suppressing Chinese telecom companies under the excuse of [threatening] national security."They are politicizing normal economic activities, Zhao said.Stockholm announced the decision ahead of the spectrum auction scheduled for next month. According to the Swedish Post and Telecom Authority (PTS), the setting of the licence conditions followed assessments by the Swedish Armed Forces and security service, which has called China "one of the biggest threats against Sweden."The Swedish authorities gave companies in the auction a deadline of January 1, 2025 to remove Huawei and ZTE equipment from their existing infrastructure."The ban leaves network operators with less options and risks slowing the roll out of 5G in markets where competition is reduced," said Ben Wood, chief of research at leading research mobile communication company CCS Insight, as quoted by Reuters. Sweden-based telecommunications giant Ericsson, Huawei's biggest rival in 5G technology, may likely be one of the beneficiaries.British political and international relations analyst Tom Fowdy questioned the legitimacy of the move. Specifically, he pointed out that Swedish products have been widely valued and put in use in China, "one must question whether it is fair that Sweden is banning Huawei and ZTE. Is this the reciprocity on market access that Europe keeps asking for?""China is opening its markets, but as seen by the new entity list and export control laws, it is also equipping itself with tools to deal with countries that are not playing fairly," Fowdy wrote in a CGTN opinion piece.On Tuesday, the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm also rejected accusations that Huawei and ZTE posed threats to Sweden's national security."We urge the Swedish government to abide by the market principles of open development and fair competition, and reconsider the relevant decision," the embassy wrote on its website."We are resolutely opposed to abusing the concept of 'national security' and â¦ rejecting specific enterprises from specific countries," it added.Sweden's ban on two Chinese telecommunication companies, Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp., from its 5G networks on Tuesday has drawn strong opposition from Beijing."Huawei Technologies and ZTE Corp. have been strictly abiding by local laws," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Wednesday.

Based off state data, with almost 1.7 million people voting, turnout jumped 142% in the first eight days compared to the same time four years ago.As millions of votes come in across the U.S., it's unclear how long it will take to count them all, which means a clear winner might not be decided by the end of the night on November 3rd.The process for receiving and counting votes also differs by state.

As of Tuesday, more than 4.6 million Texans have voted, according to the U.S. Elections Project.That's more than half of the ballots counted for the 2016 presidential election, Fox News reports.The state also saw a jump in voter registration this year.

The coronavirus pandemic and severe flooding have added to its woes.Removal from the terrorism list â once Khartoum sets aside $335 million it agreed to pay to U.S. victims of militant attacks and their families â could help ease economic pain, partly by unlocking international financing and debt relief.Washington has offered Sudan development and humanitarian help, U.S. and Gulf-based sources said in September, after U.S. officials and military head General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan discussed the issue of Israel in September.But while the United States has been lobbying hard for Sudan to normalize ties with Israel just as it finalizes Khartoum's removal from the list, Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok has argued the two issues should not be linked."It is not possible for an entire people to be forced to normalize in a week or two," acting Finance Minister Hiba Mohamed Ali told Sudanese TV on Monday."If it is our wish to normalize relations with Israel, we must give a suitable chance for the issue to be studied in detail."Despite apparent support from Burhan, who met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Uganda in February, and his military deputy Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who recently praised Israel's economic development, a rapid move to normalize ties could fracture the civilian coalition they share power with."Our view of the Zionist entity remained fixed â that it is a racist entity hostile to all national liberation movements," said Sadiq Farouk, a Communist Party leader from the coalition that backs the government.Hamdok has said he is not authorized to decide on ties with Israel. "With this position, Hamdok wants to avoid any decision that might lead to a split in the ruling coalition that supports the government," said Fath Alrahman Ahmed of Khartoum's Al-Neelain University.Recognizing Israel could also trigger a backlash from Islamist factions loyal to Bashir that have sought to discredit the transition.Still, people have been able to signal support for establishing ties publicly for the first time.A former member of parliament, Abulgasem Bartum, says he is planning a private trip with 40 Sudanese businesspersons, sportspeople and cultural figures to Israel as a confidence building measure next month.In Jerusalem, Zvi Hauser, chairman of the Israeli parliament's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, told public broadcaster Kan Israel could help the region with science and technology and he hoped Sudan joined the "wave" of recognition.Some younger Sudanese, less wedded to the Palestinian cause than their parents or grandparents, say they could also back the move."I have no objection to Sudan having normal relations with Israel if this is in the interest of the country," said Ahmed Ibrahim, a 30-year-old telecommunications company employee."We want jobs, health, education and a better life ... Sudan should take care of itself."U.S. pressure on Sudan to normalize ties with former adversary Israel has stirred public debate on a topic that was long a taboo, exposing splits that could complicate any swift settlement of a deal.An agreement between Sudan and Israel may have edged closer on Monday when U.S. President Donald Trump signaled that Washington would remove Khartoum from its list of state sponsors of terrorism.Military figures leading Sudan's political transition have appeared open to normalizing ties, but civilian groups including left-wing and Islamist politicians are more reluctant.A technocratic government has so far rebuffed U.S. advances aimed at pushing Sudan to follow the lead of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, both of which signed agreements to establish formal ties with Israel at the White House last month.Khartoum's caution reflects concerns that such a major foreign policy move at a time of deep economic crisis could upset the delicate balance between military and civilian factions, and even put the government at risk, two senior Sudanese government sources said."Taking a historic decision over relations with Israel requires a situation of economic and political stability in the country," said one of the sources."After the lifting of U.S. sanctions, Sudan could discuss dialogue about normalization with Israel and its benefits to Sudan, according to Sudan's interests."Sudan, which historically has been staunchly opposed to Israel, is 18 months into a political transition after autocrat Omar al-Bashir was forced from power following popular protests.The government faces spiraling inflation of more than 200 percent and has struggled to provide basic commodities and services.

He described the visit as "a glorious day for peace."  "Today, we are making history in a way that will stand for generations," the right-wing premier said of the Israeli-UAE accord, which has been angrily denounced by the Palestinians.   The two states signed four agreements on Monday, including one "exempting our nationals from visas," Netanyahu announced, arguing that free movement of people would offer benefits to the Israeli and Emirati economies. Wasel Abu Youssef, a member of the Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization, described Tuesday's UAE visit as "shameful." Speaking in Ramallah, in the Israel-occupied West Bank, he said it came amid Israeli settlement expansion in the West Bank. "The bilateral agreements that were announced today and the delegations that come and go, all of that offers the occupation a strength to escalate its aggression and its crimes against the Palestinian people and increases its intransigence and arrogance," he said. In Gaza, Hazem Qassem, a spokesman for the Islamist group Hamas, said, "Such a visit will only encourage the occupation to pursue the gradual annexation of West Bank lands."The five-hour visit would be restricted to the airport near Tel Aviv due to coronavirus concerns, Israeli organizers said. (With input from agencies; Cover: CFP)Israel and the United Arab Emirates agreed Monday to reciprocal visa-free travel, making Emirati citizens the first in the Arab world to be exempted from Israeli entry permits.   The deal was signed after the first-ever official delegation from the UAE landed in Israel for a day of talks following an agreement to normalize ties signed at the White House last month.   Wearing a mask, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu greeted the UAE delegation at Ben Gurion Airport near Tel Aviv.

But besides free publicity, some of these companies are also profiting from the race. Unlike Twitter, which banned political ads, Facebook is still running them, and Trump's and Biden's expenditures on this platform have hit $165 million since the beginning of the year.According to information available at the Facebook Ad Library, and analysed by CGTN Digital, between January 1 and October 17, Democratic candidate Joe Biden poured in $82.71 million and President Donald Trump $82.38 million into the platform.Since January this year, the Republican candidate has been spending on Facebook ads, but has now been surpassed by Biden. The Democrat started investing more heavily at the beginning of August, before being formally nominated by the party, and then intensified spending after the nomination. In the week between October 11 to 17 and the last 30 days (September 18 â October 17), Biden outran Trump in terms of expenditures on Facebook. In that week alone, the Democrat side spent $7.14 million and the Republicans another $4.51 million. Biden is certainly using part of the $383 million raised in September, a significant $135 million more than Trump's $248 million.Starting this month, the president has been spending less and less, which might be considered a strange move, as polls show voters are giving the lead to the Democrats, and increasing social media campaign could help bridge the gap with its specific targeting.Besides, his presidential campaign gained a reputation for running the strongest digital ad promotion in 2016, which might mean a new push before the seven-day ad ban on Facebook is implemented. The company decided in September to restrict new political ads in the week before the election and remove posts that convey misinformation about COVID-19 and voting as to avoid being used to sow chaos and spread misinformation before, during, and after the U.S. presidential election.

Biden spent more than Trump on those states: $1.53 million and almost $1 million, respectively.Other focus states are Texas and California. The president has used $6.49 million in ads in the Lone Star State, double the amount of Biden, who doesn't seem to be focusing there.

But besides free publicity, some of these companies are also profiting from the race. Unlike Twitter, which banned political ads, Facebook is still running them, and Trump's and Biden's expenditures on this platform have hit $165 million since the beginning of the year.According to information available at the Facebook Ad Library, and analysed by CGTN Digital, between January 1 and October 17, Democratic candidate Joe Biden poured in $82.71 million and President Donald Trump $82.38 million into the platform.Since January this year, the Republican candidate has been spending on Facebook ads, but has now been surpassed by Biden.

Armenia denied firing it.The ceasefire was agreed on Saturday after an earlier deal brokered by Russia failed to halt the deadliest clashes in the South Caucasus since the 1990s.So far, the main driver of diplomacy between the ex-Soviet enemies has been Russia. Armenia's Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev both told Russia's TASS news agency in separate interviews on Monday that they were ready to come to Moscow for talks.The failure to stop the fighting has raised fears of a humanitarian crisis, and put new strains on ties between Turkey, which strongly backs Azerbaijan, and its NATO allies which want the conflict to end.Nagorno-Karabakh, a breakaway enclave of Azerbaijan that is populated and controlled by ethnic Armenians, said 729 of its military personnel and 36 civilians had been killed in fighting that began on September 27. Azerbaijan said 61 Azeri civilians had been killed and 282 wounded. It has not disclosed its military casualties.Officials in Nagorno-Karabakh said Azeri forces were shelling their positions in northern and southern areas of the line of contact that divides them.They said Azeri forces had shelled civilian settlements including the town of Martuni and four villages - charges that were denied by Azerbaijan. They reported one civilian killed and one wounded in Martuni.The Azeri defense ministry said Armenian forces were shelling the Agjebedin, Tovuz and Dashkesan regions far from the conflict zone â accusations denied by Armenia.The ministry also said Terter and Aghdam regions were under shelling. AzTV state television said one of its journalists was wounded in Terter.The Azeri prosecutor general's office said Armenia had targeted a pipeline in the Khizi district of Azerbaijan, more than 300 km (186 miles) from the conflict zone, on Sunday afternoon. The pipeline, which carries oil to Novorossiisk in Russia, was not damaged but some missile fragments fell about 250 meters (820 feet) away, it said.Dismissing the report, Armenian defense ministry spokeswoman Shushan Stepanyan said: "It's a total lie.âA ceasefire brokered in Moscow earlier this month was aimed at letting the sides swap detainees and bodies of those killed, but it had little impact on the fighting.The new ceasefire was announced on Saturday after Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov talked to the Armenian and Azeri foreign ministers by telephone.A new ceasefire in the mountain territory of Nagorno-Karabakh was in jeopardy on Monday with Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenian forces reporting shelling and heavy fighting.Among accusations on both sides, Azerbaijan said it had "neutralized" a missile fired by Armenian forces at an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan on Sunday, several hours after the ceasefire went into force.

Protestors were using Twitter and the #EndSars hashtag to spread photos and videos showing alleged police brutality.Most demonstrations are now peaceful, after the Nigerian authorities barred the police from using force against the protesters, but the reported violence is on the rise.At least two were killed around demonstrations on Saturday in Osogbo in southwestern Osun state, a spokesman for Governor Gboyega Oyetola told Reuters.

Many showed up wearing masks to protect against the coronavirus pandemic, held up banners, sang and danced. Police even gradually pulled back from the Plaza Italia."It's great, very good and positive. They're pure good things for Chile in everything from here," demonstrator Viviana Donoso, 43, told AFP as she and a group of people danced to drums."The people of Chile need to unite, and we have to believe that we can do things."Some even turned up to the demonstration in fancy dress. Demonstrators also called for their countrymen to vote to "approve" the proposed constitutional change, a key demand of the 2019 protests."This is the opportunity to say enough! We're here and we're going to vote for 'Approve,'" Paulina Villarroel, a 29-year-old psychologist, told AFP.Police estimated that Sunday's rally in Santiago attracted around 25,000 people by 6 p.m., far smaller than the largest protests of 2019.The demonstrations, while largely peaceful early on, were marred by increasing incidents of violence, looting of supermarkets and clashes with police across the capital later in the day. Fire truck sirens, burning barricades on roadways and fireworks on downtown streets added to a sense of chaos in some neighborhoods.Interior Minister Victor Perez spoke late in the evening, praising the early, peaceful rallies while blasting the late-night mayhem. He called on Chileans to settle their differences by voting in the upcoming constitutional referendum."Those who carry out these acts of violence do not want Chileans to solve our problems through democratic means," Perez told reporters, vowing to punish those who crossed the line Sunday.Early in the day, an angry mob jeered and threatened a Communist Party mayor. Later, masked individuals firebombed a police headquarters and church. Vandals attacked another Santiago church in the early evening, setting its spire aflame and choking side streets with smoke.More than 15 metro stations were temporarily closed amid the unrest. Police fired tear gas and water cannons in skirmishes with sometimes violent, hooded and masked people.Last year's protests, which began October 18, raged until mid-December as Chileans gathered nationwide to call for reforms to the pension, healthcare and education systems. Rioting and looting resulted in billions of dollars in damage and losses to the country's businesses and infrastructure. The unrest saw the military take to the streets for the first time since the rule of Augusto Pinochet.In the past few days, small-scale demonstrations and isolated incidents of violence have nonetheless resurfaced in Chile, as the capital's six million citizens emerge from months of confinement following the COVID-19 pandemic.Most demonstrators on Sunday wore masks, but many could be seen in tight groups, raising concerns about a potential health risk.(With input from agencies)Tens of thousands of Chileans gathered in the central square of Santiago to mark the one-year anniversary of mass protests that left over 30 dead and thousands injured, with peaceful rallies on Sunday devolving by nightfall into riots and looting.People gathered early in the day in demonstrations downtown and in cities throughout Chile that gained size and fervor through the evening.

It also shows the Chinese people's unity and love for their country and the Chinese nation's determination to safeguard peace. Wang called for carrying forward the spirit of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea to strive for a decisive victory in building a moderately prosperous society in all respects and to achieve the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation.Covering some 3,300 square meters, the exhibition features 540 photos, 15 artworks and a total of 1,900 items, including maps, documents, flags, badges, and weapons, which were used or captured during the war.Among them are 824 pieces of precious cultural relics unveiled to the public for the first time, according to the organizers.Through a large number of precious exhibits, the event reflects the nature of justice and great victory of the war, and recounts CPV soldiers' heroic deeds and revolutionary spirit during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953).On October 19, 1950, as requested by the DPRK, CPV forces crossed the Yalu River to aid the DPRK's fight there until a truce was signed in 1953.

Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory," the embassy said.China and the Pacific island country established diplomatic relations in 1975.According to official Chinese data, the bilateral trade reached over $482 million in 2018, representing a 26-percent increase from the year before.China highly appreciates the Fijian government for upholding the one-China principle and expects that the Fijian side will tackle this issue properly, the embassy said.Foreign Ministry: Taiwan is playing the trick of a thief crying 'stop thief'The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday said Taiwan is playing the trick of a thief crying "stop thief," and stressed that any attempt to use the Taiwan issue to provoke ties between China and Pacific island countries will not succeed.There is no "diplomatic relationship" between Taiwan and Fiji, said spokesperson Zhao Lijian.

The record-shattering figure is being driven in part by concerns about crowds at polling sites on Election Day amid the coronavirus pandemic.In North Carolina, a battleground where 1.4 million, or 20 percent, of the state's registered voters, had already voted as of Sunday morning, Biden urged residents to cast ballots as soon as possible. "We gotta keep the incredible momentum going; we can't let up," he said at a "drive-in rally" in Durham, as attendees sitting in their cars honked in approval. "Don't wait - go vote today."Biden also criticized Trump for saying over the weekend that the U.S. had "turned the corner" in the coronavirus pandemic, noting that the rate of new cases across the country has risen to the highest level in months."As my grandfather would say, 'This guy's gone around the bend if he thinks we've turned the corner,'" Biden said.

Trump put a handful of 20 dollars bills into an offering bucket and bowed his head during a prayer.Trump will campaign every day leading up to Thursday's debate in Florida, including stops in Arizona and North Carolina, campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh said.While Trump lags in opinion polls at a national level and in many battleground states, Biden campaign manager Jen O'Malley Dillon said over the weekend that the national figures are misleading because must-win states are close."We cannot become complacent because the very searing truth is that Trump can still win this race, and every indication we have shows that this thing is going to come down to the wire," she wrote in a memo to donors.U.S. presidential elections are determined by electoral votes, allotted to U.S. states and territories based largely on their populations, rather than by a tally of the popular vote nationwide.Trump campaigned on Saturday in Michigan and Wisconsin, two battleground states he narrowly won in the 2016 election.In Muskegeon, Mich., he attacked Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, for imposing restrictions to slow the spread of the coronavirus and made light of a right-wing plot uncovered by the FBI to kidnap her."Hopefully you'll be sending her packing pretty soon," Trump said, prompting the crowd to yell back "Lock her up!" several times.Whitmer said on Sunday's "Meet the Press" on NBC that the president's rhetoric was "incredibly disturbing" and "dangerous" for her and her family as well as other politicians whom he targets.(With input from Reuters and AFP)President Donald Trump and rival Joe Biden were courting early voters on Sunday in the competitive states of Nevada and North Carolina, as the final presidential debate looms later this week.Both men are working to rouse their political bases and appeal to the seemingly small number of undecided voters in an election that could revolve around voter turnout.One key opportunity comes this week with the candidates' final nationally televised debate, on Thursday evening in Nashville, Tennessee.Some 27.7 million Americans have already cast ballots either by mail or in-person ahead of the November 3 election, according to the U.S. Elections Project at the University of Florida.

The government of Bahrain, where a Sunni Muslim minority rules a Shi'ite majority population, has said the deal protects its interests from Iran.Mnuchin described the accord as an important step in regional stability and "just the beginning of the work that is going forward.""I think the opportunity is way beyond just investments," Mnuchin earlier told reporters on the El Al flight. "It's in technology, building various different businesses - and in the case of Bahrain as well, really expanding the opportunities for them quite, quite, quite dramatically."The ceremony also saw the signing of several memoranda of understanding. They cover trade, air services, telecommunications, finance, banking and agriculture.Mnuchin and the other U.S. officials will travel on Monday to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where the accord with Israel has uncorked bilateral commerce.

They cover trade, air services, telecommunications, finance, banking and agriculture.Mnuchin and the other U.S. officials will travel on Monday to the United Arab Emirates (UAE), where the accord with Israel has uncorked bilateral commerce. On Tuesday, the U.S. officials will join the UAE's first delegation to Israel.Israel and the UAE will sign a deal on Tuesday to allow 28 weekly commercial flights between Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion airport, Dubai and Abu Dhabi, Israel's Transportation Ministry said on Sunday.(With input from Reuters, AFP) The UK government has become embroiled in a stand-off with the northern metropolitan area of Greater Manchester after the region's mayor refused to move the area into England's strictest tier three alert level without improved financial support.The Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, has demanded an improved financial package for employees of businesses who will be forced to close their doors as a result of the new measures.Burnham also believes self-employed and low-paid workers haven't been given enough help to survive the coming months and wants the government to pay them more money if they're unable to work.  On the streets, Burnham has the support of local people.Alex, an insurance worker, tells CGTN Europe he is very concerned.

Similarly, Republican George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore in 2000, but the Democrat still lost the election. And Trump could earn a second term as president even if Biden wins the most votes across the country.In a certain sense, the national vote is irrelevant in U.S. presidential elections â all that matters is the Electoral College.How does the Electoral College work?The Electoral College essentially creates 51 mini-elections, with individual contests in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia (DC). A total of 538 Electoral College votes (EVs) are split between the states and DC. The EVs are weighted by population and mirror the spread of seats in Congress: 435 representatives, 100 senators plus an additional three votes for DC equals 538.For example, California, the most populous U.S. state, has 53 representatives and two senators â equaling 55 electoral votes. Wyoming, the least populous state, has just one representative and two senators â and so three electoral votes.In all states bar Maine and Nebraska â which award two EVs to the statewide winner and one to the winner in each congressional district â the statewide winner takes all the votes.To win the presidency, a candidate must win enough states to pass the magic number of 270 â a majority of EVs.Why are the swing states critical?Strategizing where to campaign â and spend money on advertising and organizing â is vital to reaching 270. Recent history suggests around 37 states plus DC are firmly committed or lean heavily to one party or the other.It's safe to assume, for example, that California's 55 votes will go to Biden, and Wyoming's three will stick with Trump. Overall, there are around 17 states plus DC reliably in the Democratic column and 20 in the Republican column.By this measure, Biden effectively starts the election on 212 votes and Trump on 115. So where can the Democrat win the 58 votes he needs, and where can the Republican find 155?The key to every U.S. presidential election lies in the swing states, the battlegrounds which either party has a chance of winning. These are the states where the candidates will spend heavily on advertising and â pandemic allowing â make numerous campaign visits. In 2020, the key states to watch are Florida (29 EVs), Pennsylvania (20 EVs), North Carolina (15 EVs), Michigan (16 EVs), Wisconsin (10 EVs), and Arizona (11 EVs) though in such an unpredictable year others, such as Minnesota (10 EVs), Georgia (16 EVs) and Texas (38 EVs), could also come into play.How are Biden and Trump aiming to win?A starting point for determining the battlegrounds is to assess the margins of victory in 2016: Trump triumphed over Clinton with victories of less than one percentage point in the Blue Wall states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.Those 46 Electoral College votes, won by the narrowest of margins in Midwestern states which hadn't voted Republican in decades, put the Republican in the White House.The president can afford to lose two of the Blue Wall states in 2020 and still narrowly win the Electoral College â so long as he holds on to all the others, he took in 2016 when he won states reflecting 306 Electoral College votes in total.The first and most obvious route to President Biden is for him to hold the states Clinton took in the last election and flip back Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin â that would give him 278, putting him in the White House even if he loses vote-heavy states like Florida.The Trump campaign initially looked to expand its target states to those won narrowly by Clinton in 2016, such as New Hampshire (4 EVs), Minnesota and Nevada (6 EVs) but has since changed strategy to focus on holding Florida, Pennsylvania, Georgia, Arizona, and North Carolina.Biden, with a big cash advantage over Trump, could have a unique opportunity in 2020 to make inroads into traditional Republican bastions like Georgia and Texas.How is the winner decided?The winner of the presidency is the candidate with at least 270 EVs, but the process by which the state results are decided could be particularly contentious in 2020, with both parties fielding armies of lawyers in the swing states and rows over ballots likely.The EVs are really votes for individual electors, people chosen by the parties in each state to vote for either Trump or Biden on its behalf. This can create confusion, as constitutionally electors don't have to follow the states' popular votes â as several didn't in 2016 â though most are now compelled to do so by state law..While the winner of the election is traditionally projected on election night, the situation in 2020 is unique â at least half of the votes may be cast by mail or early, a huge increase on past elections â and so unless there is a decisive winner, the final result may not be known for days or weeks after November 3.The official timeline is an afterthought in most years but could be important in this cycle.The 538 electors must cast their votes by December 14, and the electoral votes must be passed to the president of the Senate by December 23. The votes are then passed to the new Congress, which meets in a joint session to count the votes on January 6 before inauguration day on January 20.What happens if there's a tie?The Electoral College system does leave open the potential for a 269-269 tie â in that scenario, the president would be decided by the state delegations in the House of Representatives.Each state would have one vote, irrelevant of their size or number of representatives, so 26 would be the number to hit.Ahead of the 2020 elections, the Republicans marginally control the most state delegations despite the Democrats holding a majority of representatives because smaller states like Wyoming, Alaska, and Montana that have just one representative are in the Republican's hands.In the event of a tie, the vice president would be elected by the Senate via majority vote.Video by Xu Qianyun, Ma Zhiyuan, Zhou Jinxi and Chen HaominScript by John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.The clock is ticking towards election day in the United States, with the eyes of the world on the battle between Donald Trump and Joe Biden for the keys to the White House.The winner of the November 3 contest is decided via a system designed to give all 50 states a say, but it can have a curious outcome: the candidate with the most votes doesn't necessarily become president.Democrat Hillary Clinton won three million more votes than Trump in 2016, for example, but she's not in the White House.

He has controversially received the open backing of Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.Akinci's relationship with Ankara, on the other hand, has come under strain, especially after he described the prospect of the north's annexation by Turkey as "horrible" in February.Turkey has now engaged in a bitter dispute over oil and gas reserves in the eastern Mediterranean, partly because its claim over the marine resource around TRNC's territory isn't recognized by Greece and Cyprus. Sunday's second-round ballot was triggered after Tatar won 32 percent of the vote on October 11 ahead of Akinci, who garnered almost 30 percent in a field of 11 candidates.But Akinci is in a stronger position in the second round, having won the backing of Tufan Erhurman, a fellow Social Democrat, who came third last time around."The results of the first round tell us this: half of the Turkish Cypriot community defend a federation despite all kinds of pressure," Umut Bozkurt, vice dean and assistant professor at Eastern Mediterranean University, told AFP."This election was dominated more by Turkey-northern Cyprus relations than the Cyprus issue."The first round's results also show that a significant part of the electorate seek to be free of "pressure" from Ankara and to live in a united Cyprus, she added.Don't want to be puppetsIn the days leading up to the vote, Turkish Cypriot Twitter users used the hashtag #BarisCunku, meaning "Peace because" in Turkish.One user calling himself Ahmet Karaca wrote on Thursday, "#PeaceBecause, we don't want to be puppets in our own country, we want to be the actor, the director."When Akinci took office in 2015, he was hailed as the leader best placed to revive peace talks with the Republic of Cyprus.But hopes were dashed in July 2017 after UN-mediated negotiations collapsed in Switzerland, notably over the question of the withdrawal of tens of thousands of Turkish soldiers stationed in the TRNC.The polls come amid an economic crisis, deepened by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has largely shuttered the tourism sector and led to the closure of Ercan airport in the north and crossing points to the south.The vote also comes after Turkey on Monday resumed gas exploration in the eastern Mediterranean, stoking tensions with Greece and the Republic of Cyprus in the south.The European Union has deplored Turkey's deployment of exploration vessels and warned Ankara against further "provocations" while multiple countries have staged military drills in the region in recent months.Earlier in October, Turkish troops angered the Republic of Cyrus and many Turkish Cypriots by reopening public access to the fenced-off disputed seaside town of Varosha for the first time since Turkish forces invaded the north.That move drew EU and UN criticism and sparked demonstrations in the Republic of Cyprus, which exercises its authority over the island's southern two-thirds, separated from the north by a UN-patrolled buffer zone.Turkey has repeatedly said it seeks to defend Turkish and Turkish Cypriots' rights in the eastern Mediterranean against a cabal of nations including Greece and Cyprus.(With input from AFP)Turkish-held northern Cyprus, a breakaway state recognized only by Ankara, votes Sunday for a new leader in a run-off election held amid heightened tensions in the eastern Mediterranean.The presidential vote pits the incumbent and favorite, Mustafa Akinci, 72 â who supports reunification with the majority Greek-speaking EU member the Republic of Cyprus in the south â against the right-wing Turkish nationalist Ersin Tatar.Tatar, 60, who advocates a two-state solution, now holds the title of "prime minister" in the self-proclaimed Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).

There are over 7.3 million Bolivians eligible to vote on Sunday to pick up for new president, vice president, senators, deputies, and others for the period of 2020-2025."They are been expected in the election points where they will be safe. These (election) packages are going to be received in those points, logged and guarded," said Luis Vilca, an official for the Bolivian Electoral Tribunal. The leading contenders for the presidency are former Economy Minister Luis Arce and former President Carlos Mesa, a centrist historian and journalist. To avoid a second round, the election winner requires at least 40 percent of valid votes in the first round and a 10-point advantage over the closest competitor.The electoral tribunal announced on Saturday that the upcoming elections will be monitored by 213,600 citizen observers. Special election observation missions are also expected from a dozen international organizations, such as the EU, the Organization of American States and the UN, as well as several Bolivian civic organizations. In the days leading up to the vote several international observers had arrived in the Bolivian capital to ensure the execution of fair elections.The vote will be key to the direction of the landlocked country after a ballot last year prompted ousted President Evo Morales' resignation and plunged the Andean country into turmoil. However, it is reported that Bolivians in wealthier areas of the capital city of La Paz have begun stocking up on essential supplies and queuing up to buy gas ahead of the election, fearing a return of deadly clashes.The incumbent president Anez took office in November 2019 after the long-term leftist leader Evo Morales resigned the presidency and went into exile when police and army withdrew their support of him. Anez then announced her job as interim president would be to convoke elections to replace Morales. On that November, Bolivia had seen weeks of protests and turmoil where people claimed fraud over the reelection of Morales, who governed for nearly 14 years.While Morales was barred to participate into the elections for the presidency or the senate followed his ouster, he chose Arce as his stand-in for the Movement To Socialism party.

Period," she said."Vote for your daughter's future," read one message in the sea of signs carried by demonstrators. "Fight like a girl," said another.In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the demonstrations were considerably smaller, though protesters still turned out in cities across the country, according to organizers.More than 100,000 people took part in some 430 marches in locations from New York to Los Angeles and Chicago to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, organizers said.They urged people worried about in-person participation to join in a "socially distant text-banking telethon" aimed at sending five million messages encouraging people to vote.Marchers also paid tribute to late Supreme Court justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg â an icon for women and progressives â while protesting Trump's choice of conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett to replace her.Barrett has made no secret of her strong Catholic beliefs, raising concerns that a Supreme Court dominated by conservatives could overturn abortion rights if she is confirmed by the Senate.Trump and his fellow Republicans are seeking to fast-track her nomination before the election, a process that began this week and which has drawn sharp controversy.The protest route in Washington started near the White House before heading to the U.S. Capitol and the Supreme Court building, where a smaller "I'm With Her" counterprotest â in Barrett's favor â was held.Most marchers in Washington wore face masks to stem the spread of COVID-19, with some dressed as Ginsburg in black robes with white lace collars, and many wore the knitted pink hats made famous by the original march.A number of protesters dressed in red robes and white bonnets, portraying characters forced to bear children in the dystopian novel and television series "The Handmaid's Tale."Signs and banners underscored the broader anti-Trump message: "Trump/Pence: Out Now," read one, while others simply said, "Dump Trump."In New York, around 300 people gathered at Manhattan's Washington Square, many with pink hats and signs supporting Trump's Democratic opponent Joe Biden or honoring Ginsburg. It was one of five separate marches in the city."It's really important to be here and try to encourage people to vote out Trump and his misogynistic policies, especially now, with COVID, when a lot of people are isolated," said Yvonne Shackleton, a 47-year-old working mother from near Albany, about a three-hour drive from New York City.A similar number of people gathered in Brooklyn, Ginsburg's hometown, with one protester's sign reading: "Ruth Sent Us.""I'm out here because it's so important that people vote and I'm telling people to vote blue for Biden and (running mate Kamala) Harris because Trump has been a disaster for our country," said Wendy Sacks, a 67-year-old vintage jewelry seller.Mask-wearing protesters marched in Chicago with the same message, banging drums and chanting for Trump's defeat.Next month's presidential contest was also the focus of a separate New York protest Saturday in which hundreds of demonstrators protested the killings of Black people by police officers.Among those protesting was Tamika Palmer, the mother of Breonna Taylor, a Black medical worker killed by officers in March during a raid at her home in Louisville, Kentucky.A grand jury decided last month not to charge any of the police officers involved with her death; instead, one officer was charged with shooting into a neighboring home."People need to get out and vote," Palmer told those at the event.

Iran's Foreign Ministry has declared it as victory of "multilateralism, peace and security," despite Washington's pressure to reimpose sanctions.The arms embargo ends as part of Resolution 2231 of a landmark 2015 nuclear deal among Iran, Russia, China, Germany, Britain, France and the United States, which gave Iran relief on sanctions in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.It means Iran will be legally able to both buy and sell conventional arms, including small arms, missiles, helicopters and tanks."As of today, all restrictions on the transfer of arms, related activities and financial services to and from The Islamic Republic of Iran, and all prohibitions regarding the entry or transit through territories of the United Nations Member States previously imposed on a number of Iranian citizens and military officials, are all automatically terminated," Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said said in a statement on October 18.No special action was necessary from the Iranian side as the embargo lifts automatically if no extension or additional measures are taken by the Security Council, the statement said.Iran also said it was self-reliant in its defense and had no need to go on a weapons buying spree."Iran's defense doctrine is premised on strong reliance on its people and indigenous capabilities ... Unconventional arms, weapons of mass destruction and a buying spree of conventional arms have no place in Iran's defense doctrine," said in the statement.Tehran has made strides in ramping up its local production of conventional weapons and defensive capabilities under the pressure of multilateral sanctions over the past decades.Authorities have said Iran will be ready to sell arms when the embargo ends.In late August, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said it would be a "good idea" to consider purchasing missiles from Iran after rival Colombia said Maduro was looking into this plan.Although Tehran tends to exaggerate its weapons capabilities, concerns remain about its long-range ballistic missile program which contributed to Washington leaving the Iran nuclear deal in 2018.Tensions concerning arms control between Washington and Tehran have soared ever since.Related readings:Timeline: Is the landmark Iran nuclear deal coming to an end?From coup to Soleimani's assassination: Seven decades of US-Iran relations in picturesIn August this year, the Trump administration triggered a process aimed at restoring all UN sanctions, after the UN Security Council rejected a U.S. bid to extend the conventional arms embargo on the country.A month later, the U.S. unilaterally announced reinstating all UN sanctions on Iran that were lifted as part of the nuclear deal, a move which would automatically extend the arms embargo as well.The overwhelming majority of UNSC members rejected the bid, saying it has no legal basis. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also told the council he would not take any action on the U.S. declaration.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned it will have a "decisive response" if the U.S. tries to "bully" other nations into adhering to its reinstatement of sanctions.Last week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said during a news conference in Tehran the arms embargo will end on October 18 despite U.S. efforts to block it.However, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, together known as the E3, wrote a joint statement in July, saying that while E3 will remain committed to fully implement Resolution 2231 of the nuclear deal, they believe lifting of the arms embargo "would have major implications for regional security and stability.""We recall that the EU embargoes on conventional arms exports and missile technology will remain in force until 2023," they said.(With input from agencies)The international conventional arms embargo on Iran, imposed 13 years ago by the United Nations Security Council (UNSC), was due to expire on Sunday.

UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres also told the council he would not take any action on the U.S. declaration.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani warned it will have a "decisive response" if the U.S. tries to "bully" other nations into adhering to its reinstatement of sanctions.Last week, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said during a news conference in Tehran the arms embargo will end on October 18 despite U.S. efforts to block it.However, the foreign ministers of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, together known as the E3, wrote a joint statement in July, saying that while E3 will remain committed to fully implement Resolution 2231 of the nuclear deal, they believe lifting of the arms embargo "would have major implications for regional security and stability.""We recall that the EU embargoes on conventional arms exports and missile technology will remain in force until 2023," they said.(With input from agencies)The foreign ministers of Austria and Belgium have both tested positive for coronavirus after attending a meeting with European Union colleagues this week.

According to the Azeri authorities, 60 Azeri civilians had been killed and 270 wounded since the fighting flared on September 27, but no military casualties have been released so far.In a televised address to the nation, Azerbaijan's president, Ilham Aliyev, denounced the missile strike as a war crime and warned the leadership of Armenia that it would face responsibility."Azerbaijan will give its response and it will do so exclusively on the battlefield," Aliyev said.The Armenian Defense Ministry denied launching the Saturday strike, but the separatist officials in Nagorno-Karabakh put out a statement listing alleged "legitimate" military facilities in the city of Ganja, although they stopped short of claiming responsibility for the attack. Stepanakert, the regional capital of Nagorno-Karabakh, came under intense shelling on Saturday, leaving three civilians wounded, according to the Nagorno-Karabakh authorities.The Azerbaijani military declared Saturday that they downed an Armenian Su-25 jet, a claim quickly dismissed by Armenia's Defense Ministry.

COVID-19 epidemic coupled with floods in southern China posed daunting challenges to the national fight against penury.  Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed at a symposium on securing a decisive victory in poverty alleviation in March that lifting all rural residents living below the current poverty line out of poverty by 2020 is a solemn promise made by the CPC Central Committee, and it must be fulfilled on time.The present poverty eradication goals consist of not only eliminating all instances of absolute poverty on schedule, but also consolidating the achievements of poverty reduction efforts, ensuring that people who have gotten out of poverty do not fall back into it."Being lifted out of poverty is not an end in itself but the starting point of a new life and a new pursuit," Xi said at the poverty alleviation symposium, emphasizing the need to synchronize poverty alleviation with rural revitalization.After China achieves building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, it must make all-out efforts to advance rural revitalization to further address issues such as the urban-rural imbalance, Xi said during an inspection tour to Sanjia Village in Tengchong CIty, southwest China's Yunnan Province in January. Liu Yongfu, director of the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development, highlighted that poverty alleviation should be a continuous and sustainable work, as "relative poverty" will still exist even after the country eliminates "absolute poverty" by 2020.Read more: Latest data reveal how far away China is from the 2020 poverty elimination goal Graphics: Ending China's poverty by 2020 Graphics by Chen YuyangOctober 17 marks China's National Poverty Relief Day, a reminder that the country has reached the final stage of its mission to eradicate extreme poverty by the end of 2020.With only 75 days left for the year, how far is China from achieving that goal and what's next?Most provinces and regions have already been declared free of absolute poverty. By the end of 2019, the number of poor rural residents in the country plunged from 98.99 million in 2012 to 5.51 million in 2019, showed data from China's National Bureau of Statistics.Read more about how China is leading global anti-poverty efforts How China is championing climate change mitigation and poverty reductionAnd the number of impecunious counties in China has fallen from 832 in 2015 to 52 in 2019, according to the State Council Leading Group Office of Poverty Alleviation and Development.In 2020, 52 poverty-stricken counties in seven provinces and regions became key poverty-eradication battlegrounds.

No leader has achieved an absolute majority since New Zealand adopted a proportional voting system in 1996, leading to multi-party governments' succession.While the count has not been finalized, the figures were enough for opposition leader Judith Collins to concede after phoning Ardern."Congratulations on your result because it is, I believe, an outstanding result for the Labour Party. It has been a tough campaign," Collins told cheering supporters in Auckland. Her conservative National Party was expected to take around 35 seats in what appears to be its worst result in nearly 20 years.Ardern's performance beat pre-election opinion polls and put Labour on course for its strongest showing since 1946.Party president Claire Szabo praised the charismatic leader's campaign, who sparked a wave of support dubbed "Jacinda-mania" when she took over the party in 2017 as it was languishing in the polls."There's no doubt the strong, great leadership we've had from Jacinda Ardern has been a massive factor in all this," she told NZ.Ardern had dubbed the vote "the Covid election" and campaigned on her government's success in eliminating community transmission of the virus, which has caused just 25 deaths in a population of five million.The pandemic is just one of a string of crises that showed Ardern's leadership qualities during a torrid first term. She displayed both empathy and decisive action on gun control after a white supremacist gunman killed 51 Muslim worshippers in the Christchurch mosques attack last year.Ardern again found herself comforting a shocked nation when a volcanic eruption at White Island, also known as Whakaari, killed 21 people and left dozens more with horrific burns."No matter what crisis is thrown my way, you will always be assured I will give my everything to this job, even if that means a huge sacrifice," she said this week.A month after new COVID-19 infections in Auckland, the election was delayed, which led to a second lockdown in the country's largest city.Life is back to normal in New Zealand, but its borders are still shut, its tourism sector is bleeding, and economists predict a lasting recession after the harsh lockdowns.The economy shrank at a 12.2-percent annual clip in the second quarter, its steepest drop since the Great Depression.

It will go into effect on June 1, 2021.According to experts, the current existing law faces severe challenges due to the emergence of fresh social problems. For example, in some cases, the minors' guardians themselves are the domestic violence abusers; school bullying is frequent but often covered; numerous minors are addicted to online games and sexual abuses against minors are often conducted by people in close contact with the victims, like teachers, neighbors and relatives.As a response to theose problems, the revised law has formulated and improved related protective measures, clearly stipulated the responsibilities of parents, schools, society, government and judicial organs in safeguarding the well-being of minors.In terms of internet use by minors, the law highlighted that producers and sellers of network products should install online software for protecting minors or offer a clear information on how to install such a software.And they should also remind minors to protect their personal information and impose protective restrictions on minors' use of their personal information online. Without the consent of parents or other guardians, they're forbidden to collect, store and use minors' personal information.Besides, the new law urges schools to establish a mechanism to prevent school bullying, and provide training for faculties, staff and students in stopping school bullying. Schools and parents are also asked to provide psychological counseling and support to prevent psychological trauma of minors.Moreover, the law emphasized the importance of sex education and self-protection awareness of minors, asking related departments and organizations to conduct sex education that is appropriate for the minor's age.At the same time, the law introduced new job rules to further prevent child sex abuse, requiring kindergartens, primary and secondary schools, and certification bodies that grant teacher qualifications must check the legal record of the job seekers and teaching candidates to exclude and disqualify those who have been charged with or convicted of child molestation or sexual abuses.China's freshly revised Law on the Protection of Minors was adopted with a vote at the 22nd Session of the Standing Committee of the 13th National People's Congress on Saturday.The revised law, introduced in 1991 and revised in 2006, has significantly increased the number of articles from 72 to 130, adding two new chapters involved government protection and online protection for minors.The new law includes general provisions and protections for the areas of family, school, society, Internet, government, judiciary as well as legal responsibility and supplementary provisions.

recent diplomatic interactions with Southeast Asian countries have enhanced unity between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and deepened the cooperation of regional anti-pandemic fight, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Friday.He made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua after holding talks last week with Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesian president's special envoy, and Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and wrapped up Friday his Southeast Asia tour, which has taken him to Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand and Singapore.This is Wang's first tour to Southeast Asian countries in the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.Strengthen unityThe Chinese foreign minister believes that his visit has first of all enhanced the unity between China and the ASEAN."We have exchanged views and reached a series of consensus on major issues, such as jointly responding to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving international situation, deepening bilateral relations, maintaining regional peace and stability, and improving the global governance system," Wang said.He noted that all parties should further enhance mutual trust and solidarity, and continue to push forward the development of relations between China and ASEAN countries, so as to bring them to higher levels.Deepen cooperationFurthermore, cooperation on the fight against the pandemic has been deepened, Wang said.It is agreed that East Asia has made outstanding achievements in combating against COVID-19, which comes from countries' commitment to putting the people first, taking scientific epidemic prevention measures, sticking together and providing mutual assistance and support, Wang said.All parties should improve the level of joint prevention and control against the pandemic, enhance the exchange of prevention and treatment experience, and strengthen cooperation in vaccine research and development, production and use, he added.China, Wang said, will continue to help ASEAN countries to prevail over the pandemic, including providing necessary anti-epidemic materials, carrying out cooperation on vaccine, assisting the establishment of nucleic acid testing laboratories, supporting ASEAN in launching an anti-epidemic fund, and establishing repositories for emergency medical supplies.According to Wang, the Southeast countries have spoken highly of China's vaccine research and development and expressed the hope to conduct all-dimension cooperation with China in vaccine research and development, purchase, production and use.On the issue concerning the life and health of all mankind, the international community should cooperate with each other, he said, adding "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the necessary conditions for global vaccine development.China has made it clear that it is willing to make efforts within its capacity in vaccine development, and give priority to the needs of developing countries including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, he added.Promote economic recoveryThirdly, the economic recovery in post-pandemic era was promoted, Wang noted."All parties have spoken highly of China's major anti-epidemic achievements and its progress in the resumption of work and production, and they look forward to and believe that China will continue to be the main engine driving global economic recovery," Wang said.They all hope to take the opportunity of China's "dual circulation" development pattern and dock China's Belt and Road Initiative with their own countries' development strategies, so as to embark on the fast track of post-pandemic economic recovery as soon as possible, he said.Enhance regional peace and stabilityThe fourth is that the visits have strengthened regional peace and stability, said Wang.In the face of foreign forces stirring up trouble and creating tension in the South China Sea, Wang noted that the Chinese side has emphasized that the South China Sea should not become a sea for great powers to play games or for gunboats to overrun, which is generally recognized by all parties.The countries agreed to resolve differences through friendly consultation, fully and effectively implement the Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea as well as endeavor for an early conclusion of a more binding and effective Code of Conduct in the South China Sea, and jointly safeguard peace and stability in the region, he added.Safeguard international equityFifth, the visits have safeguarded international equity and justice, Wang said.He said that the countries have expressed the need to oppose power politics and unilateral bullying, uphold the basic norms of international relations, firmly practice the concepts of multilateralism and win-win cooperation, and make joint efforts to promote democratization of international relations and multi-polarization of the world.Access to COVID-19 vaccineWang also reiterated China's willingness to make efforts within its capacity in vaccine development, and give priority to the needs of developing countries including the ASEAN countries.Speaking on how China will fulfill its commitment to make vaccines a global public good, Wang said that the virus knows no borders, and only when all countries get rid of the epidemic can the global fight against the COVID-19 be a final victory.Vaccines are the "ultimate weapon" to prevail over the epidemic, he said, calling on international community to working jointly on issues concerning the life and health of all mankind. "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the necessary conditions for global vaccine development.China will earnestly fulfill its commitment to make vaccines a global public product once they are successfully developed and put into use, and will contribute to the accessibility and affordability of the vaccines in developing countries, Wang pledged.'Dual circulation'Wang noted that a new economic development pattern featuring "dual circulation," in which domestic and overseas markets complement and reinforce each other, with the domestic market as the mainstay, has been a major strategic deployment by the Chinese government."China will promote high-quality development and build a new system of an open economy of a higher level," Wang said. "The scale of the domestic market will be further expanded. The combination of the domestic and international markets will be closer. There will be more room for cooperation between countries and China."ASEAN countries are in the best position to draw momentum from China's new development pattern and seize the opportunity, Wang noted, adding that they are also in the best position to expand mutual benefit and achieve economic recovery and better development with China.China's huge market size will first benefit its neighbors, providing ASEAN countries with a broader export market, said the Chinese minister.China is ready to work with ASEAN countries to implement an upgraded China-ASEAN Free Trade Area protocol and sign the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership within this year, continue to make the China International Import Expo and the China-ASEAN Expo a success, and import more products needed by the Chinese market from ASEAN countries, Wang said.(With input from Xinhua)The recent diplomatic interactions with Southeast Asian countries have enhanced unity between China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and deepened the cooperation of regional anti-pandemic fight, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said Friday.He made the remarks in an interview with Xinhua after holding talks last week with Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan, Indonesian president's special envoy, and Philippine Foreign Secretary Teodoro Locsin in southwest China's Yunnan Province, and wrapped up Friday his Southeast Asia tour, which has taken him to Cambodia, Malaysia, Laos, Thailand and Singapore.This is Wang's first tour to Southeast Asian countries in the context of the normalization of epidemic prevention and control.Strengthen unityThe Chinese foreign minister believes that his visit has first of all enhanced the unity between China and the ASEAN."We have exchanged views and reached a series of consensus on major issues, such as jointly responding to the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic and the evolving international situation, deepening bilateral relations, maintaining regional peace and stability, and improving the global governance system," Wang said.He noted that all parties should further enhance mutual trust and solidarity, and continue to push forward the development of relations between China and ASEAN countries, so as to bring them to higher levels.Deepen cooperationFurthermore, cooperation on the fight against the pandemic has been deepened, Wang said.It is agreed that East Asia has made outstanding achievements in combating against COVID-19, which comes from countries' commitment to putting the people first, taking scientific epidemic prevention measures, sticking together and providing mutual assistance and support, Wang said.All parties should improve the level of joint prevention and control against the pandemic, enhance the exchange of prevention and treatment experience, and strengthen cooperation in vaccine research and development, production and use, he added.China, Wang said, will continue to help ASEAN countries to prevail over the pandemic, including providing necessary anti-epidemic materials, carrying out cooperation on vaccine, assisting the establishment of nucleic acid testing laboratories, supporting ASEAN in launching an anti-epidemic fund, and establishing repositories for emergency medical supplies.According to Wang, the Southeast countries have spoken highly of China's vaccine research and development and expressed the hope to conduct all-dimension cooperation with China in vaccine research and development, purchase, production and use.On the issue concerning the life and health of all mankind, the international community should cooperate with each other, he said, adding "We should not fight alone, still less monopolize resources."Noting that China is one of the frontrunners in vaccine development, Wang said China has shared the genetic sequence of the virus with the World Health Organization in a timely manner at the early stage of the epidemic, creating the

Chinese President Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting.China's economy faces challenges as the world is undergoing profound changes, the meeting said. As a significant part of the "dual circulation" strategy, the Chengdu-Chongqing economic rim will bring high-quality growth for the region, widen the market and stabilize the production chain and supply chain.The economic rim aims to make the two megacities important growth engines, innovation hubs, and desirable cities to live for the vast regions in western China, it said.The plan also asks Chengdu and Chongqing to play a leading role in China's Belt and Road Initiative and promote economic connectivity with regional countries.But the meeting didn't release a roadmap for the implementation of the strategy. 'Dual circulation' modelPresident Xi first raised the idea of "dual circulation" in May and later elaborated that China will rely mainly on "internal circulation" - the domestic cycle of production, distribution, and consumption - for its development, supported by innovation and upgrades of the economy.Xi also said "internal circulation" will be supported by "external circulation"."Dual circulation" is by no means a closed domestic loop, Xi has emphasized on different occasions, reaffirming that opening-up was a fundamental national policy.Speaking to local people during his recent inspection in Guangdong Province, Xi said he was there to send a clear message that China will continue to walk down the road of reform and opening-up. China must adhere to the opening-up policy in an all-round way and enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going global," Xi reasserted at the event marking the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone (SEZ).Chengdu, located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, is known for its China Panda Base.

Each week we crunch the numbers in search of the trends that matter in the battle for the presidency.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionElection day in the United States is a little over two weeks away and more than 18.9 million Americans have already voted. Has the trajectory of campaign changed over the last week?The national pictureThe national polls have heavily favored Biden in the fallout period from the first presidential debate and Trump testing positive for COVID-19, and that trend has continued over the past seven days with the Democrat hitting the 50-percent mark for the first time in CGTN's analysis of publicly-available opinion polls.Biden stretched his lead over Trump from 8.3 points to 8.6 over the week, leaving him in a strong position and suggesting the president will need everything to go right in the swing states if he is to have a chance of re-election â and will have to make the second presidential debate, scheduled for October 22, count. High-quality individual national polls in recent days have consistently indicated Biden holds a double-digit lead, with YouGov, Reuters, NBC and NPR surveys suggesting Trump is down by at least 10 points.In the generic ballot, a measure of which party voters intend to back in congressional elections in November, Democrats are leading the Republicans by 7 points in the RealClearPolitics average, up from 6.6 a week earlier. While the Democrats appear likely to retain control of the House of Representatives, the battle for an all-important majority in the Senate remains neck and neck.The states that matterThe extent of Biden's national polling lead suggests he's almost certain to win the popular vote, just as Hillary Clinton did in 2016, but it's the individual states that matter in the Electoral College system.CGTN analysis of state polling indicates the Democrat has an advantage over Trump in many of the battlegrounds, though the margins are smaller than his national lead.Both Biden and Trump again campaigned in the pivotal state of Florida â now the president's home state â over the past week, and polling suggests the fight for its 29 electoral votes is narrowing: the Democrat has a 3.2-point lead, down from 3.4 points seven days ago.Trump held a televised town hall in Miami on Thursday following the cancellation of the second debate, as Biden took part in a similar event at the same time from Pennsylvania, the Midwestern state that the Republican is currently putting the most resources towards keeping in his column.Winning the Blue Wall of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin pushed Trump over the edge in 2016, but his campaign has diverted cash away from the latter two states over the past two weeks. Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes, is shaping up to be crucial: Biden holds a 6.2-point lead in the state of his birth, according to the polling averages, down from 6.3 a week ago.Polls only provide a snapshot in time and have a margin of error, but the state-by-state surveys suggest if the election were held today Biden could be on course to win 355 Electoral College votes to Trump's 183, unchanged since last week.Twitter rowsCGTN is using exclusive AI technology to weigh sentiment towards tweets related to the election, updating every 24 hours to reflect whether comments about Trump and Biden are positive, negative or neutral.Sentiment towards the candidates followed a familiar pattern over the past seven days, with tweets related to Trump a net negative 4.2 by daily average and tweets related to Biden net positive 7.9. Twitter itself was at the center of two election-related storms over the past week, suspending fake accounts claiming to be run by Black supporters of Trump only after being alerted to the issue by a newspaper investigation and then blocking an unsubstantiated New York Post article about Hunter Biden, the son of the Democratic nominee. The decision to block the URL of the Biden article and lock the account of White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany, after she posted the link, led to uproar from Republicans.Money talksIn the money stakes, the two candidates are on very different tracks in the final stretch of the election.The Biden campaign and its affiliated committees set a new monthly fundraising record by hauling in $383 million in September, a huge $135.2 million more than Trump and his affiliates' $247.8 million.The Democrat's big cash advantage in the closing stages of the race is already evident in how the campaigns are spending their money.Trump, with $251.4 million on hand at the start of October, according to his campaign, cancelled ad buys in Midwestern states he probably needs to win and diverted cash to Sunbelt states that he simply cannot afford to lose.Biden, with $432 million in reserve, expanded his spending into traditionally Republican states including Texas, where polling suggests he only narrowly trails the president. The combination of polling numbers and cash on hand favoring the Democrat mean that with a little more than two weeks to go, the Trump campaign is on the defensive while Biden is in a strong position to attack as the campaigns head towards Thursday's final debate. (Graphics by Li Yueyun)Scan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.Joe Biden and Donald Trump resumed something like a traditional presidential campaign over the past seven days with the clock ticking ever closer to the November 3 election day in the United States.The Democrat and Republican candidates crisscrossed the country to meet voters and win airtime, with the former vice president using his cash advantage â after another record-breaking fundraising month in September â to expand his ad buys and put the president's campaign on the back foot in Texas, North Carolina, Iowa and Georgia, all states Trump won comfortably in 2016.CGTN's interactive page offers in-depth analysis of the 2020 election, with exclusive data covering national and state-by-state polling, online sentiment and fundraising.

Minister Wang Yi stressed on Friday.In an article titled "Two Decades of a Shared Journey toward New Heights in the New Era" to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese foreign minister called for increasing cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, and achieving greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.According to Wang, in the last 20 years, the FOCAC has witnessed the consolidation of the political foundation of both sides, fruitful practical cooperation results, increased people-to-people exchange and strengthened mutual support.He said the FOCAC is a source of inspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations as the two sides have always pursued solidarity, consultation, and cooperation, advanced win-win cooperation for development, supported each other in trying times and embraced openness and inclusiveness.Looking into the future, Wang said China and Africa should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for the mankind, set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation and unleash a greater potential in practical cooperation.Here is the full text of Wang's article:This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). On October 12, President Xi Jinping and President Macky Sall of Senegal, the current African Co-Chair of the FOCAC, issued a joint congratulatory message to mark this important occasion. Embracing the dawn of the new century and the trend of peace and development 20 years ago, China and our brothers in Africa decided to initiate the FOCAC to promote win-win cooperation. Since then, the family of China and African nations has had its own platform for collective dialogue and mechanism for practical cooperation, ushering in a brand new chapter in China-Africa relations.IThe past 20 years have been a journey of productive cooperation. The FOCAC has bolstered high-level interactions and political trust between China and Africa, delivering a leap in China-Africa relations from "a new type of partnership" to "a new type of strategic partnership" and to "a comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership."China-Africa cooperation has made impressive achievements. In 2019, direct Chinese investment stock in Africa topped $49.1 billion, up by nearly 100 times from the year 2000; China-Africa trade reached $208.7 billion, 20 times the size of 2000. China has been Africa's largest trading partner for 11 years in a row, and has contributed more than 20 percent to Africa's growth for a number of years. Many flagship projects, such as the African Union (AU) Conference Center, the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, and the Mombasa-Nairobi Railway, among many others, have been completed and put into use. Cooperation in other fields, ranging from science, education, culture and health to people-to-people exchange, peace and security, has also made significant headway.Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), President Xi Jinping has set great store by China's relations with Africa. He personally laid down principles guiding China's Africa policy, including sincerity, real results, amity and good faith, and pursuing the greater good and shared interests, and called for building a stronger China-Africa community with a shared future. His devotion to leadership diplomacy with Africa has given a strong boost to the relations between the two sides.The political foundation has been cemented. In 2013, President Xi Jinping chose Africa as the destination of his first overseas visit as the Head of State of China. So far, he has visited Africa four times, covering all sub-regions of the continent. In 2015 and 2018, Chinese and African leaders convened two historic FOCAC summits: one in Johannesburg and another in Beijing. In June this year, the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19 was held at a critical moment in tackling the coronavirus. Political interactions between the two sides are more frequent, extensive and unprecedented in scale. For example, on the sidelines of the FOCAC Beijing Summit, President Xi Jinping attended more than 70 bilateral and multilateral events in eight days. With the re-establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the Gambia, SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe, and Burkina Faso, the China-Africa family has been further expanded.Practical cooperation has been fruitful. China-Africa economic and trade cooperation has been growing at a higher speed, demonstrating three encouraging shifts: from government-driven to market-driven, from trade in goods to industrial cooperation, and from engineering contracts to investment and operations. Together, the two sides have drafted and implemented 10 cooperation plans and eight major initiatives, taking practical cooperation to a new level. China-Africa Belt and Road cooperation is progressing with a strong momentum: 44 African countries and the AU Commission have signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, and a host of projects such as railways, roads, airports, ports and power stations have come to fruition, enabling remarkable change in Africa's economic and social development.People-to-people exchanges have been thriving. Events across a diverse range of areas, including the China-Africa Youth Festival, the Think Tank Forum, the Joint Research and Exchange Program, the Poverty Reduction and Development Conference, and the China-Africa Press Center, have been successful. And the China-Africa Institute has been inaugurated. So far, China has provided about 120,000 government scholarships to African countries, set up 61 Confucius Institutes and 44 Confucius Classrooms in collaboration with 46 African countries, sent 21,000 doctors and nurses in medical teams to 48 African countries, treating around 220 million African patients, and forged 150 pairs of sister cities. All these efforts have consolidated popular support for China-Africa friendship.Mutual support has been further strengthened. China and Africa fought side by side against both Ebola and COVID-19. The two sides have supported each other on issues of each other's core interests and major concerns. China-Africa peace and security cooperation has been enhanced. The two sides have jointly supported multilateralism, opposed unilateralism and protectionism, safeguarded the international order and international system with the United Nations at the core, and promoted the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and other basic norms governing international relations. Such collaboration has effectively upheld the shared interests of developing countries as well as the overall interests of the whole international community.IIThe past 20 years have been a journey of overcoming challenges and enhancing partnerships. The FOCAC has withstood the test of the volatile international landscape, and scored historic achievements. It is a vivid epitome of China's pioneering efforts in foreign affairs under the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy. It is also a source of aspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations.We have always pursued solidarity, consultation and cooperation. China is the largest developing country and the African continent home to the largest number of developing countries. When China-Africa cooperation prospers, South-South cooperation will prosper. When the voice of the 2.6 billion people in China and Africa are heeded and respected, the world will have genuine fairness and justice.From the very beginning, we have always taken China-Africa relations as part of South-South cooperation, and have advanced the FOCAC in the spirit of solidarity and cooperation. The FOCAC, composed of China and 53 African countries and the AU, is by no means "one vs. 54", but "54 plus one". We would sit down in consultation whenever there is an issue, and solve it through discussion. And that is the guiding principle for our conduct. China has never interfered in African countries' pursuit of development paths that suit their own national conditions, never imposed its will upon others, never attached any political strings to its assistance, and never sought selfish political gains in investment and financing cooperation.We have attached great importance to the Forum's role in drafting overall plans and providing strategic guidance, and we have paid equal attention to China's ties with each FOCAC member, so that the Forum mechanism and bilateral cooperation can complement each other in forging a strong network of partnerships between and among countries. The Forum has significantly increased the international profile of China-Africa relations, and has become a pacesetter for South-South cooperation and cooperation by the international community with Africa.We have always advanced win-win cooperation for development. Both China and Africa are at a crucial stage of development and rejuvenation. The Chinese and African peoples are entitled to live a better life. President Xi Jinping has made it clear that no one could hold back the Chinese people or the African people as we march toward rejuvenation. Cooperation and development have always been FOCAC's top priority. We have fully leveraged our unique strengths, such as the great complementarity between our economies and development stages. We have developed greater synergy between our development strategies and embarked on a path of win-win cooperation with distinctive features.Our cooperation is about action and results. Every three years, the FOCAC rolls out a package action plan. The 2018 Beijing Summit alone produced more than 880 deliverables. We always deliver and we do not make empty promises. We have kept pace with the times and kept our mind open to break new ground and tide over challenging times. According to African friends, the FOCAC is a cooperation mechanism that truly delivers.We have always supported each other in trying times. China-Africa friendship was born in the formidable years of national liberation and is deeply rooted in our peoples' heart. As President Xi said, China and Africa are friends tested by adversity, and such friends must never be forgotten.During the 2008 international financial crisis, China and Africa rendered each other valuable support. Instead of reducing assistance, China bucked the trend and increased its support to Africa. During the 2014 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, when others chose to leave, Chinese doctors and nurses braved their lives and rushed to the hard-hit regions to help local people fight the disease, writing an indelible chapter in the history of humanitarian assistance of the People's Republic of China. Faced with the onslaught of COVID-19 worldwide, China and Africa have again stood shoulder to shoulder to help each other.What we have gone through together shows that China and Africa are more than just partners. We are comrades-in-arms. The more severe the difficulties, the more determined and confident we are about China-Africa cooperation, and the more capable the FOCAC is in pooling our strengths to forge ahead, making itself the key driving force for the time-honored China-Africa friendship.We have always embraced openness and inclusiveness. The FOCAC was established to answer the call of the times for peace, development and win-win cooperation. It serves as a fine example of multilateralism. China and Africa have all along upheld the principle of openness and inclusiveness. A closed-door policy or exclusiveness is never an option. Colonial plunder and the Cold-War rivalry brought excruciating sufferings to the African people. That part of history must not be repeated. Africa must never again be an arena for major-power rivalry. This belief is widely shared by people across Africa, and should be respected by the entire international community.Openness is vital in cooperation with Africa. It is important to share experience and learn from one another, so that Africa's peace and development can benefit from the common effort and contribution of the international community. Africa's cooperation with China has improved its development capacity and business environment, which in turn has created favorable conditions for other countries' cooperation with the continent. China has taken part in more Africa-related trilateral and multilateral cooperation in recent years. We commend and encourage such cooperation and will continue our support.IIIThe past 20 years have been a journey of China and Africa coming together as one community with a shared future. Today, the world is being shaped by changes unseen in a century, a process accelerated by COVID-19. China and Africa are good friends, partners and brothers, and more importantly, an important force for world peace and development. In this changing world, China and Africa need to stay united and work more closely together to make the FOCAC a greater success and further strengthen China-Africa relations, so as to further enhance our friendship and justice in the world.China and Africa can and should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind. The more complex and fluid the international landscape is, the greater the imperative for China and Africa to adhere to the fundamental direction of building a China-Africa community with a shared future. We should continue to follow the principle of sincerity, real results, amity and good faith as well as the principle of pursuing the greater good and shared interests. We need to maintain the momentum of high-level exchange, share more governance experience with each other, build a stronger bond between the Chinese and African peoples, and continue to elevate the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership. We need to promote the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, step up mutual support on issues involving each other's core interests and major concerns, and work together for greater democracy in international relations. We need to take the side of the overwhelming majority of the international community, stay committed to multilateralism, and align global governance reforms with the common interests of developing countries. With these efforts, we will make the China-Africa relationship a trailblazer and a shining example in building a community with a shared future for mankind.China and Africa can and should set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation. China and Africa have fought hard for what we have achieved in tackling COVID-19. As the virus continues to spread globally, both China and Africa are confronted with the formidable task of combating the virus while stabilizing the economy and protecting people's livelihoods. We will speed up the implementation of the important measures that President Xi Jinping announced at the Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity Against COVID-19, and make China's contribution to making vaccines accessible and affordable for African countries as soon as possible. China will continue to provide COVID-19 containment supplies, send expert teams, and facilitate Africa's procurement of medical supplies from China. China will strive for breaking ground for the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters by the end of this year. These are concrete actions that will show the world that China and Africa have the determination and strength to defeat COVID-19 together.China and Africa can and should unleash greater potential in practical cooperation. COVID-19 will not hamper China-Africa cooperation. As one of the first countries to fully reopen the economy, China aims to foster a new development paradigm with domestic circulation as the mainstay and domestic and international circulations reinforcing each other. This will bring new opportunities for China and Africa to deepen, transform and upgrade their cooperation. China supports Africa's effort to develop the African Continental Free Trade Area. We encourage Chinese companies and financial institutions to take an active part in infrastructure connectivity projects in Africa, which will facilitate cross-border logistics and customs clearance. We are ready to work with the international community in supporting Africa's integration process and sub-regional economic community-building. China hopes to work with Africa to deepen the integration of our industrial and supply chains, and encourages Chinese businesses to invest and conduct technological cooperation in Africa. We will support Africa's agricultural modernization and industrialization drive to raise the added value and competitiveness of Africa's exported energy, mineral and agricultural products. China will work with the international community to support Africa's integration into the global industrial and supply chains. China and Africa should to join hands in pursuing green, low-carbon, circular and sustainable development. This will contribute to African countries' ability to tackle climate change.As an ancient Chinese saying goes: "Having scaled a cloud-shrouded mountain peak, we rest our horses and set sail for the vast ocean." The China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward. The development of the FOCAC will never take a break. Standing at a new historical starting point, China will continue to follow the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy and, with the personal commitment and support of Chinese and African leaders, increase the cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, tighten China-Africa ties against all odds, and achieve greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.China-Africa relationship will never stop moving forward and the development of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) will never pause, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed on Friday.In an article titled "Two Decades of a Shared Journey toward New Heights in the New Era" to commemorate the 20th Anniversary of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, the Chinese foreign minister called for increasing cohesion and influence of the FOCAC, and achieving greater success in our journey of building a China-Africa community with a shared future.According to Wang, in the last 20 years, the FOCAC has witnessed the consolidation of the political foundation of both sides, fruitful practical cooperation results, increased people-to-people exchange and strengthened mutual support.He said the FOCAC is a source of inspiration for further growth of China-Africa relations as the two sides have always pursued solidarity, consultation, and cooperation, advanced win-win cooperation for development, supported each other in trying times and embraced openness and inclusiveness.Looking into the future, Wang said China and Africa should be a new shining example in building a community with a shared future for the mankind, set a new benchmark for international anti-epidemic cooperation and unleash a greater potential in practical cooperation.Here is the full text of Wang's article:This year marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC). On October 12, President Xi Jinping and President Macky Sall of Senegal, the current African Co-Chair of the FOCAC, issued a joint congratulatory message to mark this important occasion. Embracing the dawn of the new century and the trend of peace and development 20 years ago, China and our brothers in Africa decided to initiate the FOCAC to promote win-win cooperation.

After falling by four million at the start of the pandemic because of a $2 trillion emergency federal aid package called the Cares Act, the number of poor people in the U.S. has risen by eight million since May.The University of Chicago and Notre Dame studies found poverty grew by six million people but unlike Columbia University, Chicago and Notre Dame show poverty has continued to grow rather than improve.Bruce D. Meyer, an economist at the University of Chicago and an author of the study told the New York Times these numbers are concerning. "They tell us people are having a lot more trouble paying their bills, paying their rent, putting food on the table," he said. The studies attribute the COVID-19 pandemic and the loss of the Cares Act to the rise in poverty. Columbia researchers say this aid helped keep more than 18 million people out of poverty during its peak in May.The program expanded unemployment benefits and provided stimulus checks for families. And while the Democrats in the House of Representatives has passed multi trillion-dollar aid package, the Republican led Senate has proposed smaller plans, leading to gridlock between both parties.The new studies from Chicago and Notre Dame also show poverty and the pandemic are impacting minority groups the hardest. "Black people and Latinos are more than twice as likely as white people to be poor," according to the studies.Based off new unemployment numbers, the AP reports the economy is still about 10.7 million jobs away from recovering the 22 million jobs lost when the pandemic started.Thursday's unemployment numbers also don't include California, which typically represents about one-fourth of unemployment claims in the country. The state paused processing new claims for two weeks so they could sort through a backlog of claims and implement fraud prevention technology.But unemployment applications rose in 17 other states.

"But we know that's not going to happen in foreseeable future."For the U.S., urging China to engage in trilateral negotiations is "nothing but a ploy to divert attention" and an excuse for the U.S. to walk away from the New START extension.Fu maintained that China is not shying away from the international nuclear disarmament process and it actually plays an active role in pushing forward international disarmament within the framework of the United Nations.China's disarmament diplomat Fu Cong on Thursday challenged U.S. claims on nuclear strategy transparency and nuclear arsenal, as Washington has repeatedly called for China to join the so-called trilateral negotiations with Russia.In terms of strategic calculation and avoiding miscalculation, China's nuclear strategy and intention are more transparent and predictable, as China pledges no-first-use of nuclear weapons and never use or threaten to employ nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states, said Fu, head of the arms control department of China's foreign ministry, in an interview with Russian newspaper Kommersant.Fu asserted that China pursues a self-defensive nuclear strategy, serving the purposes of safeguarding its national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and China takes nuclear weapons as the "ultimate deterrence," rejecting U.S. allegations of the so-called China threat.Out of safety and security concerns, China's modernizing its nuclear capacity, and we hope the international society could take an unbiased view on China's effort, Fu said.In fact nuclear forces of other nuclear powers are also undergoing modernization, and the U.S. even plans to inject $1.2 trillion to upgrade its nuclear arsenal, he pointed out.The U.S., with about 6,000 nuclear warheads, is expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence, Fu said, adding that this doctrine poses real threat to other countries.Fu reiterated that China will not participate in trilateral arms control negotiations with the U.S. and Russia to extend the New START, a flagship nuclear arms treaty between the two countries that is due to expire next February.Pressuring China to join such negotiations is "unfair, unreasonable and unfeasible," Fu said, given that the U.S. nuclear arsenal is about 20 times the size of China's.China would "be happy to" participate in such talks with the U.S. and Russia, but only if the U.S. agrees to reduce its nuclear arsenal to China's level, Fu said.

China's mass coordinated testing and targeted containment model, as shown with recent outbreaks in Beijing, Dalian and Urumqi, have proved continually successful in quashing a return of the virus, allowing life to continue as normal."This is totally different from how most European and other Western countries have approached the pandemic. Most countries still aren't conducting adequate tests. In countries such as Poland, France, Italy and Spain, mostly only the symptomatic cases are being tested and the positive cases are advised home quarantine and not immediate hospitalization as in China. And this is a huge mistake," said Dr Agnieszka Bielewicz, internal medicine specialist at ParkWayHealth, one of China's leading international healthcare providers.She noted that the European countries would do well to follow Qingdao's example. "When I say all the 9-10 million people in Qingdao are being tested, many in Europe find it hard to believe. I keep repeating that China's approach in fighting the pandemic has been absolutely outstanding and this is why people in China, including the foreigners, are really enjoying a mostly normal life now because we are free."Bielewicz, who has been living in China with her husband and three kids for over eight years, admitted however that she feels the pangs of "survival guilty" at times because her friends and relatives back in Poland cannot experience the same freedoms."It is a strange feeling. COVID-19 is not only affecting human life and health, it is affecting people's minds very deeply â their characters and feelings. It has turned our life upside down. Today, COVID-19 is affecting even global politics, economy, and each aspect of our life," she remarked thoughtfully.'I'm a doctor, I cannot give up'While the doctor now worries about her kith and kin in her home country, during the initial days of the outbreak when as a healthcare worker she was tending to her duties, it was her family and friends in Poland who were deeply concerned about her, as China was the epicenter of the pandemic at the time."As a foreign doctor, I was designated to work for the Chinese New Year holiday when all of my Chinese colleagues were to celebrate with their family. When the outbreak happened, I was already working. As the situation became uncertain, I decided to send my family back to Poland," she recalled."The entire time my family was in Poland, they were worried about my situation, about my work. And to this extent that they called me several times a day to check whether I have any symptoms," she said, noting the healthcare workers were at the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 and therefore more prone to infection."My family was really terrified that I was still working, but I'm a doctor, I cannot give up. I explained to them that due to the safety protocols and all the rules strictly introduced and implemented, I felt very safe even during the peak of the outbreak in China," she said.Bielewicz was fortunate to be reunited with her family before the international travel restrictions came into force and situation in Europe worsened. "With China enforcing strict prevention and control measures, things were improving here. I told my family that it is very safe here and they returned early March. Thankfully, my children didn't have to experience the full lockdown anywhere and they came back at a good time."'China is doing better than the rest'With COVID-19 subsequently spreading in Europe and other parts of the world, the world also witnessed a sustained campaign of disinformation against China and COVID-19, triggered by geopolitics.Bielewicz, as a health professional with a closer insight into the situation on the ground, felt compelled to clear some of the doubts through media appearances in Polish TV. At the time, people in Europe thought that the COVID-19 situation was horrific in China, that the hospitals were overcrowded, and that patients were dying in droves.The exaggerated media reports were laughable, the Polish doctor felt. "I gave several interviews to Polish TV channels explaining to them that the situation wasn't so crazy. We weren't dying [in droves]. We were not hungry. I showed them the photos of life in Shanghai, the buses, shops and streets. We could still use 'kuaidi' [express delivery] to buy things that we wanted," she elucidated.Bielewicz said people still find it hard to believe how successful China's COVID-19 fight has been. "Many people ask my mom, who is a nurse in Poland, about the situation in China and when she tells them that China has nearly curbed COVID-19 with almost zero local transmission and most new cases being imported, people react in disbelieve. They say it is impossible."The Polish healthcare professional felt that this is symptomatic of the Western media narrative that has constantly pushed a narrative of China as a "third-world" country and therefore people find it difficult to believe that "China is doing better than we are doing."Will there be a second wave?While the recent Qingdao outbreak has prompted fears about a second wave, more so, as the winter flu season is approaching in China, Bielewicz expressed confidence about the protocols and measures in place even if there's a spike."I'm not worried too much over a second wave in China. We just witnessed how everything was controlled in Qingdao and we also know the exact source," she said. The health professional, however, strongly advocated for flu vaccination."I and all of my family members, we have flu vaccination and I encourage my patients, especially those with existing ailments such as like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetic and obesity to take vaccination for flu. I also suggest to take a pneumococcal vaccination because it protects lives," she said."Besides, I've been a big fan of Vitamin D which helps in boosting our immune system and making our bodies stronger.

China's mass coordinated testing and targeted containment model, as shown with recent outbreaks in Beijing, Dalian and Urumqi, have proved continually successful in quashing a return of the virus, allowing life to continue as normal."This is totally different from how most European and other Western countries have approached the pandemic. Most countries still aren't conducting adequate tests. In countries such as Poland, France, Italy and Spain, mostly only the symptomatic cases are being tested and the positive cases are advised home quarantine and not immediate hospitalization as in China. And this is a huge mistake," said Dr Agnieszka Bielewicz, internal medicine specialist at ParkWayHealth, one of China's leading international healthcare providers.She noted that the European countries would do well to follow Qingdao's example. "When I say all the 9-10 million people in Qingdao are being tested, many in Europe find it hard to believe. I keep repeating that China's approach in fighting the pandemic has been absolutely outstanding and this is why people in China, including the foreigners, are really enjoying a mostly normal life now because we are free."Bielewicz, who has been living in China with her husband and three kids for over eight years, admitted however that she feels the pangs of "survival guilty" at times because her friends and relatives back in Poland cannot experience the same freedoms."It is a strange feeling. COVID-19 is not only affecting human life and health, it is affecting people's minds very deeply â their characters and feelings. It has turned our life upside down. Today, COVID-19 is affecting even global politics, economy, and each aspect of our life," she remarked thoughtfully.'I'm a doctor, I cannot give up'While the doctor now worries about her kith and kin in her home country, during the initial days of the outbreak when as a healthcare worker she was tending to her duties, it was her family and friends in Poland who were deeply concerned about her, as China was the epicenter of the pandemic at the time."As a foreign doctor, I was designated to work for the Chinese New Year holiday when all of my Chinese colleagues were to celebrate with their family. When the outbreak happened, I was already working. As the situation became uncertain, I decided to send my family back to Poland," she recalled."The entire time my family was in Poland, they were worried about my situation, about my work. And to this extent that they called me several times a day to check whether I have any symptoms," she said, noting the healthcare workers were at the front lines of the fight against COVID-19 and therefore more prone to infection."My family was really terrified that I was still working, but I'm a doctor, I cannot give up. I explained to them that due to the safety protocols and all the rules strictly introduced and implemented, I felt very safe even during the peak of the outbreak in China," she said.Bielewicz was fortunate to be reunited with her family before the international travel restrictions came into force and situation in Europe worsened. "With China enforcing strict prevention and control measures, things were improving here. I told my family that it is very safe here and they returned early March. Thankfully, my children didn't have to experience the full lockdown anywhere and they came back at a good time."'China is doing better than the rest'With COVID-19 subsequently spreading in Europe and other parts of the world, the world also witnessed a sustained campaign of disinformation against China and COVID-19, triggered by geopolitics.Bielewicz, as a health professional with a closer insight into the situation on the ground, felt compelled to clear some of the doubts through media appearances in Polish TV. At the time, people in Europe thought that the COVID-19 situation was horrific in China, that the hospitals were overcrowded, and that patients were dying in droves.The exaggerated media reports were laughable, the Polish doctor felt. "I gave several interviews to Polish TV channels explaining to them that the situation wasn't so crazy. We weren't dying [in droves]. We were not hungry. I showed them the photos of life in Shanghai, the buses, shops and streets. We could still use 'kuaidi' [express delivery] to buy things that we wanted," she elucidated.Bielewicz said people still find it hard to believe how successful China's COVID-19 fight has been. "Many people ask my mom, who is a nurse in Poland, about the situation in China and when she tells them that China has nearly curbed COVID-19 with almost zero local transmission and most new cases being imported, people react in disbelieve. They say it is impossible."The Polish healthcare professional felt that this is symptomatic of the Western media narrative that has constantly pushed a narrative of China as a "third-world" country and therefore people find it difficult to believe that "China is doing better than we are doing."Will there be a second wave?While the recent Qingdao outbreak has prompted fears about a second wave, more so, as the winter flu season is approaching in China, Bielewicz expressed confidence about the protocols and measures in place even if there's a spike."I'm not worried too much over a second wave in China. We just witnessed how everything was controlled in Qingdao and we also know the exact source," she said. The health professional, however, strongly advocated for flu vaccination."I and all of my family members, we have flu vaccination and I encourage my patients, especially those with existing ailments such as like heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetic and obesity to take vaccination for flu. I also suggest to take a pneumococcal vaccination because it protects lives," she said."Besides, I've been a big fan of Vitamin D which helps in boosting our immune system and making our bodies stronger. This can help our body fight the virus better in case of an infection," she added.Interviewer and script: Abhishek G BhayaVideo editors: Chen Shi &amp; Li YahuiCover image: Li JingjieDirector: Mei YanMore CGTN Interviews:'China's carbon neutral goal: Bold and inspiring''When China and U.S. work together, the entire world wins' Radical China-U.S. decoupling will throw humanity back by decadese-RMB: China gears up for digital payment 2.0Currency War: Will China's e-RMB fade out dollar's global sheen?TikTok, Huawei and Trump's tech war on ChinaHimalayan crossroads: A bumpy road ahead for China-India tiesTracing the origin and ecology of coronavirusInnovative China drives the global AI revolutionChina-India-Pakistan cooperation key for unleashing South Asia's full potentialPost-Brexit UK needs a 'balanced approach' towards China and an FTAHK &amp; U.S.: A tale of two protests and Trump's doublespeak'Hong Kong protest is pure bigotry and racism'India's COVID-19 lockdown and its side effectsMERS experience, China's situation shaped S Korea's COVID-19 strategyPost COVID-19, tourism could be 'slow' but 'smart'From dreams to doubts: Chinese students reconsider U.S. options amid COVID-19 worriesChina's night economy surges amid COVID-19 lifestyle changesTOP HEADLINES- Germany has reported a record 6,638 new infections in the past 24 hours.

a higher starting point toward further success. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks during an inspection tour in south China's Guangdong Province this week. Read more:'Reform and opening-up' remains theme of Xi Jinping's visit to China's Guangdong ProvinceXi sends 'clear message':

the planning of economic and social development during the 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025). Heritage protection Xi visited local cultural and historical landmarks, including an ancient bridge, an old gate tower and a street lined with memorial archways, in the city of Chaozhou on Monday. Hailing the city's culture as an important part of the larger Chinese culture, Xi called Chaozhou's intangible cultural heritage represented by the region's embroidery, porcelain, wood carving, sculpture, opera, tea and cuisine precious treasures of the Chinese culture. The president has always insisted that the protection and exploration of cultural heritage assets must serve a country's development.In October 2018, Xi stressed that more importance should be attached to preserving history and culture in urban planning and construction during his visit to Xiguan historical and cultural community in the Liwan District of Guangzhou City.He stressed better protection of the city's heritage, noting that proactive efforts should be made to train inheritors of the intangible cultural legacy. Self-innovation Xi later visited Chaozhou Three-Circle (Group) Co., Ltd., a leading manufacturer of electronic components and advanced materials, to learn about the company's indigenous innovation and its research on key technologies. Independent innovation is key to the growth of companies, the upgrade of industries and the high-quality development of the economy, he said.At the exhibition hall, laboratory and production workshop of the company, Xi inspected featured products and learned about its research on key technologies. "Now we are undergoing major changes unseen in a century, and we need to take the road of self-reliance on a higher level," said Xi.Further reform and opening-up During a visit to Shantou on Tuesday, Xi urged the city to promote reform and opening-up at a higher starting point and keep abreast with others in the development of special economic zones in the new era. Xi also visited a museum of correspondence from overseas Chinese, where he said the Shantou Special Economic Zone (SEZ) should guide and encourage overseas Chinese to play bigger roles in supporting and participating in China's modernization, promoting Chinese culture, facilitating peace and unity of the country and deepening exchanges and cooperation between China and the world. Talking with residents and tourists at an old downtown area in Shantou, Xi said on the 40th anniversary of the SEZs, his visit to Shantou SEZ is a statement to both China and the international community that the CPC will lead the Chinese people in unswervingly following the path of reform and opening-up, working hard to advance socialist modernization, and striving to realize the Chinese

lodged solemn representations with the U.S. for imposing sanctions on Chinese personnel, said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday.China will take countermeasures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and relevant personnel if the United States insists on going down the wrong path, Zhao stressed.The U.S. State Department on Wednesday warned international financial institutions that if they were found doing business with relevant individuals in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, they could soon face tough sanctions.China urged the United States to correct its mistake and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way.The HKSAR government in a statement released on Thursday strongly opposed and condemned the report issued by the United States under the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Act, calling it groundless and irresponsible.Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society has regained stability, national security has been guaranteed in the city and residents can again enjoy basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, said the statement.The "sanctions" by the United States have no legal effect on financial institutions in Hong Kong, and the chief executive and other officials targeted by the U.S. have made it clear that they will continue to carry out their duty of safeguarding national security in Hong Kong in accordance with the law, the statement added.The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese foreign ministry in the HKSAR Thursday also expressed firm opposition to and solemnly refuted to the so-called report.A spokesperson of the office said the U.S. ignored the fact that Hong Kong is becoming more stable and better, and the mainstream public opinion is that Hong Kong society is regrouping and starting again, and the principle of international law of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries should be respected.The U.S. side concocted the so-called Law, defamed the national security law in Hong Kong, smeared the actions taken by the central government of China and the HKSAR government to set things right, imposed sanctions on officials of the central government of China and the HKSAR government, and propped up those who are anti-China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong. This has once again exposed the sinister intentions of the U.S. in its attempt to contain China's development, the spokesperson said. However, the wrong words and deeds of the U.S. cannot stop the steady and enduring growth of "One Country, Two Systems" and the prospect of Hong Kong's integration into the development of the country. The spokesperson stressed that Hong Kong is China's Hong Kong and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs. The U.S. should correct its mistakes and immediately stop interfering in Hong Kong affairs and China's internal affairs in any way. China will continue to take resolute and effective measures to safeguard the interests of national sovereignty and security and safeguard the lawful rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and related personnel. (With input from Xinhua)China firmly opposed and strongly condemned the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Law concocted by the United States and its decision to sanction people, and has lodged solemn representations with the U.S. for imposing sanctions on Chinese personnel, said Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday.China will take countermeasures to safeguard national sovereignty and security interests and safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and relevant personnel if the United States insists on going down the wrong path, Zhao stressed.The U.S. State Department on Wednesday warned international financial institutions that if they were found doing business with relevant individuals in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including Chief Executive Carrie Lam, they could soon face tough sanctions.China urged the United States to correct its mistake and stop interfering in China's internal affairs in any way.The HKSAR government in a statement released on Thursday strongly opposed and condemned the report issued by the United States under the so-called Hong Kong Autonomy Act, calling it groundless and irresponsible.Since the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, Hong Kong society has regained stability, national security has been guaranteed in the city and residents can again enjoy basic rights and freedoms in accordance with the law, said the statement.The "sanctions" by the United States have no legal effect on financial institutions in Hong Kong, and the chief executive and other officials targeted by the U.S. have made it clear that they will continue to carry out their duty of safeguarding national security in Hong Kong in accordance with the law, the statement added.The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese foreign ministry in the HKSAR Thursday also expressed firm opposition to and solemnly refuted to the so-called report.A spokesperson of the office said the U.S. ignored the fact that Hong Kong is becoming more stable and better, and the mainstream public opinion is that Hong Kong society is regrouping and starting again, and the principle of international law of non-interference in internal affairs of other countries should be respected.The U.S. side concocted the so-called Law, defamed the national security law in Hong Kong, smeared the actions taken by the central government of China and the HKSAR government to set things right, imposed sanctions on officials of the central government of China and the HKSAR government, and propped up those who are anti-China and seek to destabilize Hong Kong.

Putin also voiced concern about the involvement in the conflict by militants from the Middle East â a reference to Turkey deploying Syrian fighters to combat Armenian forces in Nagorno-Karabakh.The two leaders "stressed the urgent need for joint efforts to end the bloodshed as soon as possible and move to a peaceful settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh problem," according to a Kremlin readout of the call.

Armenia's Defense Ministry responded by stating that it reserves the right to target Azerbaijani military objects and troop movements.So far, Armenia and Azerbaijan have denied targeting each other's territory in the fighting over Nagorno-Karabakh, although each of the parties often contested the denials.An expansion of hostilities could trigger a dangerous escalation of the decades-old conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, which is inside Azerbaijan but has been under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since the end of a separatist war in 1994. The Armenian forces have also controlled significant chunks of Azerbaijani territory outside the separatist region.The mutual accusations and threats raised concern about the safety of a strategic pipeline that carries Azerbaijan's Caspian Sea crude oil to Turkey and on to Western markets.Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev threatened "very heavy response," should Armenia "carry out its plans to destroy" oil and gas pipelines in Azerbaijan.The failure of the truce that was supposed to begin Saturday reflects the uncompromising positions of the two South Caucasus nations that have stymied decades of diplomatic efforts.

But in a world ravaged by man-made and natural disasters, the UN food body soon became synonymous with survival for millions facing hunger and starvation. On October 9, the WFP's 17,000 employees were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for fighting a relentless war against hunger in conflict zones in the midst of a deadly pandemic. Speaking exclusively to CGTN Digital, the WFP's deputy executive director Amir Mahmoud Abdulla described the recognition as a "great honor" and "quite humbling."The Norwegian Nobel Committee lauded the WFP for its efforts in "preventing the use of hunger as a weapon of war and conflict."Calling hunger "the world's biggest solvable problem," Abdulla said the award raises the organization's profile and draws the world's attention toward the link between hunger and conflict, and hunger and COVID-19. "It's not just about being able to raise more resources â for us that's hugely important because we are a voluntarily funded organization â but what's important is that there's an attention of the world on this issue of hunger â hunger caused by conflict or people's lack of earning power. Both of those problems are solvable," he said, hoping that the acknowledgment will "move the world closer to a world of zero hunger."But the goal sounds more like a dream in pandemic-wracked 2020. In 2019, the WFP assisted more than 97 million people â the largest number since 2012 â in 88 countries. According to a WFP projection, the number of hungry people could double from 135 million in 2019 to 265 million by the end of 2020. The Global Report on Food Crisis published in April puts the figure for people facing chronic food insecurity at an astonishing 821 million.With fractured supply chains, restrictions on movement, and shrinking coffers of donor governments and financial institutions, the task of putting food in the plates of those who need it the most has become even more daunting."First of all, the impact on supply lines. When you had certain restrictions being put in place. Second, the ability of people to move. Our field and humanitarian workers are moving all over the world, and we are moving them around. So that created an issue. And those who we serve suddenly found themselves more stressed than usual because of the economic impact. Also, many casual workers found themselves out of work. We found that the numbers of people who needed assistance were increasing. All of these issues compounded as the WFP is a totally 100-percent voluntarily funded organization," Abdulla said.The WFP, one of world's largest humanitarian organizations tackling hunger and food insecurity, needs to raise $6.8 billion to avert the impacts of the coronavirus crisis. So far, the Nobel laureate body has only managed to bag $1.6 billion.Emphasizing that food security, peace and stability go hand in hand, Abdulla pointed out that 10 out of 13 food crises today are caused by conflict. "Longer-term developmental solutions are required. Solutions that would include helping smallholder farmers with their own agriculture, if there are people have lost their livelihood, then putting income generation or sort of livelihood schemes. So, it's a multi-faceted approach that requires more than just the World Food Programme. That's the one thing about the work we do, we need to that in partnership with many," he said.Talking about the food crisis in Yemen, Abdulla urged warring parties to allow unhindered access for humanitarian workers to get to the places they need to. "We have seen in certain parts of Yemen our inability to supply because we are unable to get the conditions that we need to be able to monitor and be absolutely sure that the right people were getting the food, or we just had no access at all. Neither our goods nor our people have been able get through. So, the only solution is constant dialogue. We never give up and we always continue to negotiate," he said.October 16 marks World Food Day, which is dedicated to addressing the problem of global hunger and malnutrition. According to the WFP, hunger isn't always a lack of food. "Climate change is something that we need to get to grips with for sure. There's also the aspect of food waste and food lost. What's really important to recognize is that there's food waste is often in developed countries and there's food loss is many countries where we serve. And that loss is when it's lost in fields before harvesting or lost in storage before harvesting," said Abdulla, adding "if we could manage the waste in developed countries and avoid the loss in developing countries, that combined food almost on its own would solve hunger."This year 107 organizations and 215 individuals were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, including the World Health Organization and 17-year-old celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg. But a "workable scheme" that began 59 years ago grabbed the Nobel glory."We have never lost sight of what we would really like to do and that is to go back to being an experiment that could actually say: 'The experiment is over, world hunger is solved. We don't need WFP.' If we get to that, then we can say it was a successful experiment. Now it remains a project in course, and as long as we are needed our staff will be out doing what they are needed to do," Abdulla concluded. The World Food Programme (WFP) was born out of an experiment in 1961.

And that loss is when it's lost in fields before harvesting or lost in storage before harvesting," said Abdulla, adding "if we could manage the waste in developed countries and avoid the loss in developing countries, that combined food almost on its own would solve hunger."This year 107 organizations and 215 individuals were nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize, including the World Health Organization and 17-year-old celebrity climate activist Greta Thunberg. But a "workable scheme" that began 59 years ago grabbed the Nobel glory."We have never lost sight of what we would really like to do and that is to go back to being an experiment that could actually say: 'The experiment is over, world hunger is solved. We don't need WFP.' If we get to that, then we can say it was a successful experiment. Now it remains a project in course, and as long as we are needed our staff will be out doing what they are needed to do," Abdulla concluded. China and Equatorial Guinea will consolidate political mutual trust, deepen cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), and push bilateral ties to a new level, said Chinese President Xi Jinping, on Thursday, in an exchange of congratulatory messages with the President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China and African countries, including Equatorial Guinea, have worked together in solidarity and safeguarded people's lives and health, injecting new connotation into the friendship between China and Africa, Xi said.Obiang echoed that his country will keep working with China to uphold multilateralism, the consultation mechanism, and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.China and Equatorial Guinea will consolidate political mutual trust, deepen cooperation within the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative and the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC), and push bilateral ties to a new level, said Chinese President Xi Jinping, on Thursday, in an exchange of congratulatory messages with the President of Equatorial Guinea Teodoro Obiang Nguema to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries.Since the COVID-19 outbreak, China and African countries, including Equatorial Guinea, have worked together in solidarity and safeguarded people's lives and health, injecting new connotation into the friendship between China and Africa, Xi said.Obiang echoed that his country will keep working with China to uphold multilateralism, the consultation mechanism, and the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled the Trump administration can end the 2020 census count before its current deadline. Door-to-door counting will end October 15th and completing the census online will end October 16th.Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the only justice to dissent. "The harms associated with an inaccurate census are avoidable and intolerable," she wrote.The 2020 census became a controversial political topic this election year. The Trump administration cut funding to the Census Bureau. It has attempted to exclude undocumented immigrants and tried repeatedly to end the count ahead of schedule. Earlier this month, a federal judge issued an order stating the census could continue counting through the end of October.The COVID-19 pandemic also brought unprecedented problems with this year's population count. Coupled with roadblocks from the U.S. government, experts fear the census will be inaccurate and impact communities that already struggle with insufficient resources and representation.The goal of the census is to essentially count how many people live in a community. It's done every 10 years, and the data from the count determines how many congressional seats each states get in the House of Representatives and how much federal funding communities receive for education, healthcare and other public services. By ending it early, the New York Times reports, White House officials could use that data to their advantage.Minority groups and poor and young people who move frequently are often left out of the census or undercounted because they can be difficult to reach. These groups tend to live in urban areas that are often represented by Democrats. Ending the census early could deepen an undercount and "dilute" Democratic political representation, according to the New York Times.Because of COVID-19, the Census Bureau had previously received extensions for completing the count and turning in results. The deadline for finishing was pushed from the end of July to the end of October.In its push to end the count early, the Trump administration argued the Bureau would need to stop counting immediately so it could make the legal deadline of December 31 for delivering results to the president. The Trump administration would have the data needed to control representation in Congress, no matter who wins the presidential election.With the Supreme Court ruling, experts are not only concerned with undercounting and the politicization of the census but also an increase in distrust toward the bureau. Some are questioning the quality of this yearâs results and whether they can be trusted. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

The right of belligerency of the state will not be recognized," the key pacifist article in the constitution reads.Nevertheless, at the end of last month, Japan's Defense Ministry requested a record 5.49 trillion yen (about $52.17 billion) budget for the fiscal year starting in April 2021, with the request rising 3.3 percent from the initial budget for the current fiscal year through March 2021.With the ministry eyeing allocations for enhancing capabilities in outer space, cyberspace as well as financing for land-based infrastructure and hardware, Japan's defense spending under new Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is looking set to rise for the ninth straight year.Japan on Wednesday unveiled its newest 3,000-ton submarine named Taigei which was built by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd. amid no signs of the nation reining in its ever-increasing and constitutionally questionable "defense" spending.The submarine was unveiled at a shipyard in western Japan and is slated to go into service as the 22nd vessel in the Maritime Self-Defense Force's (MSDF) submarine fleet in March 2022.Tokyo has been planning to boost the number of its subs from 16 to 22 under plans laid out in its National Defense Program Guidelines in 2010, and Taigei, which means "big whale" in Japanese, will be able to house 70 crew members.The vessel is 84 meters in length and 9.1 meters in width and comes with a price tag of around 76 billion yen (about $722.23 million) to build, the MSDF said, adding that the incorporation of lithium-ion batteries allow the vessel to remain under water for longer than previous models.According to the MSDF, Japan currently operates nine 2,750-ton Oyashio-class submarines and 11 2,950-ton Soryu-class warships.The MSDF is planning to introduce a 12th Soryu-class sub next year, it said.As for the new Taigei, it will be the first in the new Taigei-class category following the Oyashio and Soryu, the MSDF explained.Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi, MSDF Chief of Staff Hiroshi Yamamura and around 150 others attended a ceremony Wednesday held at a Japanese defense equipment maker's Kobe Shipyard in Hyogo Prefecture.Japan is still bound by the constraints of its pacifist constitution, Article 9 of which states that the "Japanese people forever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.""In order to accomplish the aim of the preceding paragraph, land, sea, and air forces, as well as other war potential, will never be maintained.

The foreign minister had initially intended to visit Turkey's capital, Ankara, during his trip but canceled his plans before setting off."Ankara must end the interplay between detente and provocation if the government is interested in talks â as it has repeatedly affirmed," Maas said before leaving for Cyprus and Greece.The research ship Oruc Reis' presence "goes against what we (EU countries) agreed on, namely to try all diplomatic means to calm the intensity of tensions in a climate of trust," Maas said after visiting Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis."We've all been very surprised by what we've seen from the Turkish side in recent days," he said.Turkey on Monday raised tensions with its neighbors after it said it would redeploy the exploration vessel, Oruc Reis, to the eastern Mediterranean region off the coast of Greek islands.

But Mitsotakis stressed that his country would not engage in talks with the Oruc Reis on the Greek continental shelf.Maas arrived in Athens after talks with the Cypriot government a few hours earlier in the Cypriot capital Nicosia, where he said Turkey should make sure that "the window of dialogue that has just opened with Greece doesn't close because of unilateral measures."Athens and Nicosia are at odds with Ankara for years over maritime borders and the right to exploit energy resources. The dispute is expected on the agenda when EU leaders meet at a Brussels summit on Thursday and Friday."If Ankara continues its illegal actions, we will use all the instruments at our disposal" to respond, European Commission Chief Ursula von der Leyen has said.Meanwhile, Greece's Prime Minister Mitsotakis has stressed that before Ankara's announcement to deploy the research vessel, the two sides had agreed, under German mediation, to restart exploratory contact from where they had stopped in 2016 to reach an agreement on the delimitation of maritime zones. However, as long as the Turkish research vessel Oruc Reis is sailing in the East Med within the Greek exclusive economic zone (EEZ), there can be no dialogue, the Greek leader said.In a strongly worded statement, the U.S. State Department said it "deplores" Turkey's decision and noted that Greece "asserts jurisdiction" over areas where the Turkish ship plans to operate through October 22."We urge Turkey to end this calculated provocation and immediately begin exploratory talks with Greece," said Morgan Ortagus, spokeswoman of the State Department.

Over the past four decades, Shenzhen has been transformed from a small fishing village into a modern metropolis with a permanent population of over 13 million. "The world economy is currently facing complicated challenges. By no means should we be stopped by the reversing trends and tides. We should choose the right side of the history to unswervingly expand opening-up in an all-round way, and promote the building of an open world economy and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind," Chinese President Xi Jinping told the gathering. At a time when the global economic recovery has been complicated by the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-globalization sentiment, China in May this year brought to the table a new development pattern. Known as "dual circulation," it takes the domestic market as the mainstay while letting domestic and foreign markets boost each other. "The new development pattern is not a closed domestic circulation, but an open domestic and international dual circulation," Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed in the speech. He pointed out the need to explore a more flexible policy system and a more scientific management system in domestic and international trade, investment and financing, fiscal and tax affairs, financial innovation and border entry and exit. Shenzhen, a miracle in world development Shenzhen is a brand-new city created by the CPC and the Chinese people since the country's reform and opening-up and its development over the past 40 years is a miracle in the world development history, Xi said. Read more:Shenzhen at 40: A snapshot of landmarks over the years One small step for Shenzhen, one giant leap for China From 1980 to 2019, Shenzhen's GDP rose from 270 million yuan to 2.7 trillion yuan ($40 million to $400 billion), with an average annual growth rate of 20.7 percent, according to Xi. Its fiscal revenue also increased from less than 100 million yuan to 942.4 billion yuan ($14.9 million to $139.8 billion) during the period. Its total imports and exports climbed from $18 million in 1980 to $431.5 billion in 2019, an average annual growth rate of 26.1 percent, contributing to an all-around opening up, Xi summarized. People's livelihoods have also greatly improved in Shenzhen, with tremendous advancements in education, medical care, housing and other areas. Its per capita disposable income skyrocketed to 62,500 yuan ($9,272) in 2019, a 31.6-fold growth compared to that of 1985.Valuable experience Xi stressed the valuable experience from the development miracles of the special economic zones (SEZs) including Shenzhen. Below is some of the advice offered by the president: -- adhere to the concept that development is of paramount importance, insist on the practices of daring to try and daring to be the first, and pursue reform breakthroughs through creative thoughts. -- remain committed to opening-up on all fronts and continuously enhance the attractiveness of "bringing in" and the competitiveness of "going out." -- take innovation as the primary driving force and win the upper hand in global technological revolution and industrial transformation. -- follow the people-centered philosophy of development to allow the people to benefit more from the achievements of reform and development in a fairer way. -- ensure scientific legislation, strict law enforcement, judicial impartiality and universal law-abiding to make rule of law an important guarantee for the development of the SEZs. -- carry out the philosophy of "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets" to achieve sustained development of economy and society as well as ecology and environment in a comprehensive and coordinated way. -- implement the fundamental principle of "One Country, Two Systems" in a comprehensive and accurate way, and promote the integrated development of the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao. -- give full play to the leading and exemplary role of the SEZs while making overall plans for the country, so that they can contribute more to national development. 'Engine' for Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area Hailing Shenzhen as an "engine" for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)'s development, Xi asked Shenzhen to take active moves to further promote the construction of the area and called for efforts to synergize economic rules and mechanisms in the three regions. The GBA Initiative was first mentioned in China's 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) and aims to combine the three regions in order to turn it into one of the world's top bay areas and world-class city clusters. Read more: Why is the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area crucial? The area encompasses the special administrative regions (SAR) of Hong Kong and Macao, as well as cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Dongguan, Huizhou, Zhongshan, Foshan, Zhaoqing and Jiangmen in southern China's Guangdong Province. Local governments need to build regional railroads, allowing talents and goods to flow between the area more efficiently, which will improve market integration, said Xi. The country will deepen the reform and opening-up of the Qianhai-Shenzhen-Hong Kong pilot cooperation zone and speed up the construction of a comprehensive national science center in the GBA to enhance coordination and cooperation with Hong Kong and Macao. The GBA's platform should be fully utilized to attract more young talents from Hong Kong and Macao to come to the region to study, work and build a life, providing them with a deeper and wider level of communication and understanding of each other, the president continued. Xi welcomed greater participation of foreign countries in the reform, opening-up and development of China's special economic zones.  He said foreign participation has been indispensable in building the economic zones over the past 40 years, assisting in the creation of vast development opportunities and offering development benefits for foreign countries.Continuous reform and wider opening-up were key terms in President Xi's speech at the grand gathering, or as some experts pointed out, the southern Chinese city is the best example that shows the need for further opening-up.Read more:CGTN Opinion: Wider opening-up a key takeaway from Xi's speech"As China's first special economic zone and through the launch of a market-driven scheme that supported the attraction of a large number of foreign investments, the city has become instrumental in making China a prominent player in today's global economy," commented Matteo Giovannini, a Beijing-based finance professional. The city is home to various leading Chinese tech companies, including telecoms giant Huawei and technology conglomerate Tencent, two of the major companies that the U.S. has been putting pressure on in the most recently souring China-U.S. ties.

It insisted that Azeri forces were not violating the truce and accused Armenian forces of breaching the agreement by shelling the Azeri territories of Goranboy, Aghdam and Terter. Armenia denied the accusation and said Azerbaijan had resumed military operations "supported by active artillery fire in the southern, northern, northeastern and eastern directions."Meantime, the death toll in the conflict continues to rise. Officials at the Nagorno-Karabakh region said 532 servicemen had been killed so far, seven since Monday. Azerbaijan has reported 42 Azeri civilian deaths and 206 others wounded since the fighting erupted on September 27.

The U.S. intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy," he said.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country, said the envoy."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he added."China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail," Geng added.The ambassador emphasized that China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process."Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," he noted.China has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, said the envoy."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council) country who has made such commitments," Geng noted."China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5," the ambassador stressed.The First Committee, also known as the Disarmament and International Security Committee, is one of six main committees of the UNGA. It deals with disarmament and international security matters.The committee meets every year in October for a 4-5 week session, after the UNGA General Debate. All 193 member states of the United Nations can attend.Statement of H. E. Mr. Geng Shuang, Head of the Chinese Delegation and Deputy Permanent Representative at the General Debate of the First Committee of the 75th Session of the UNGA(From Chinese Mission to the United Nations)2020/10/12Mr. Chairman,First of all, please allow me to extend, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, my congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as Chairman of the First Committee of the current session of the UN General Assembly. The Chinese delegation wishes to assure you and other delegations of its full support and cooperation to make this session of the committee a full success.Mr. Chairman,The global strategic security and arms control situation today is faced with the gravest challenge since the Cold War. To maintain its supremacy as the sole super power, the US has reverted to the Cold War mentality, hyped up major power competition and stoked major power confrontation. These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability.For the past years, to develop military capabilities without constraint, the US has continuously withdrawn from international treaties, sabotaging the multilateral and bilateral arms control and disarmament regime built up gradually after the WWII. The US is investing trillions of US dollars to modernize its nuclear Triad, developing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, and expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence. The US has also lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, and even discussed the resumption of nuclear tests. We urge the US to faithfully fulfill its special and primary responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, positively respond to Russia's appeal for the extension of the New START Treaty, and further substantially reduce its nuclear arsenal, so as to create conditions for other Nuclear Weapon States to join multilateral nuclear disarmament.The unrestrained development and deployment of a global missile defense system by the US as well as its attempts to deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, not only pose threats to China's security, but also undermine regional peace and security and disrupt global strategic stability. China is gravely concerned and urges the US to stop relevant deployments. Should the US continue to go down this path, China will take forceful countermeasures in defense of its own national interests when necessary.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. At present, the US has gone to extremes to shift responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, exercise double standards in violation of international law on non-proliferation issues, and manipulate the peaceful use of nuclear energy for political purposes, putting all the three pillars of the NPT under unprecedented strain. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of NPT, China calls on all parties to take this as an opportunity to reaffirm the treaty obligations and commitments made in the outcome documents of previous review conferences, and work for progress on the three pillars of NPT in a balanced manner. address the differences and disputes constructively, so as to achieve pragmatic outcomes at the 10th Review Conference.Recently the US named China as "the third largest nuclear power on earth", hyped up "nuclear arms race between the US, Russia and China" and proposed so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation". This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community. The US intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country. Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the US and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation. China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail.China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process. Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China has declared the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Non-Nuclear-Weapon States or Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones. China is the only P5 country who makes such commitments. China firmly abides by its commitments on the moratorium of nuclear tests, and supports the development of the verification mechanism of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). China supports negotiation for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of a comprehensive and balanced program of work in accordance with the mandate contained in the Shannon Report, and supports the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification. China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5.In the face of the increasingly complex and ominous international security landscape, the P5 should take proactive measures to manage differences, and work together to maintain global strategic stability. Since the Beijing Conference in January last year, the P5 have reached consensus on carrying out cooperation on strategic security issues including nuclear doctrines and policies, nuclear risk reduction, etc. China suggests that the P5 continue to strengthen dialogue on nuclear policies and doctrines, jointly reiterate that "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought", make a commitment not to target their nuclear weapons at any State, commit to the no-first-use of nuclear weapons unconditionally, and conclude legally binding international instruments on providing negative and positive security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States. We urge the US to abandon the policies of nuclear umbrella and nuclear sharing, withdraw all the nuclear weapons deployed overseas, stop the development and deployment of its global missile defense system, and play a due role in improving international and regional security environment.Mr. Chairman,The root cause of the current tensions related to the Iran nuclear issue is the US unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, re-imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran, and blocking other parties from fulfilling their obligations under the JCPOA. Having withdrawn from the JCPOA, the US has no right to trigger the Security Council snap-back mechanism, and its unilateral announcement on restoration of the UNSC sanctions against Iran has no legal validity whatsoever. It is imperative that all relevant parties resolve differences over the implementation of the JCPOA through dialogue and consultation within the framework of the Joint Commission focusing on restoring the balance of rights and obligations. China attaches high importance to the concerns of relevant parties over regional security issues, and advocates, on the premise of preserving the JCPOA, the establishment of an alternative multilateral dialogue platform with the purpose of building new consensus on maintaining peace and stability in the region.The US bears the responsibility for the deadlock of the DPRK-US dialogue regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. China urges the US to show sincerity and respond with concrete actions to the DPRK's legitimate concerns over security and development, so as to bring the Peninsular nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue. China is committed to upholding the denuclearization, peace and stability of the Peninsula, and to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation. China is firmly opposed to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction beyond the mandates of the UNSC resolutions and to any attempt by forces outside the region to use the Peninsula issue as an excuse to beef up military deployment in the region. China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.Mr. Chairman,The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has sounded the alarm on bio-security and highlighted the importance and urgency of strengthening global bio-security governance. In this connection, China wishes to make the following points. First, all parties should faithfully fulfill their due obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The international community is highly concerned with the US military's biological programs. We urge the US to act in an open, transparent and responsible manner and fully clarify its activities in numerous bio-labs overseas. Second, efforts should be made to resume negotiation for a verification protocol under BWC framework in order to put in place an effective international verification mechanism for the sake of safeguarding bio-security. We hope that such a decision can be made at next year's BWC Review Conference. We once again urge the US to stop impeding the resumption of negotiation. Third, it is necessary to set up a scientific advisory body within the framework of BWC and develop a voluntary code of conduct, in order to better regulate bio-research activities and promote the sound development of bio-technologies. Fourth, it is time to establish a fair and inclusive non-proliferation, export control and international cooperation regime under the framework of the BWC, remove discriminatory barriers, ensure developing countries' rights to the dividends of bio-technologies and jointly lift global bio-security to a new level.As the only possessor of chemical weapon stockpile, the US should earnestly fulfill its obligations under the CWC and expedite the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile. In dealing with the Syrian chemical weapons issue, the provisions of CWC should be strictly observed and the authority of the Convention should be upheld. China strongly opposes political manipulation of the issue by a small number of countries for geopolitical purposes.Mr. Chairman,With the rapid development of digital economy, prominent risks associated with data security require global solutions. What is pressing now is to develop a set of international rules on data security that reflect the will and respect the interests of most countries on the basis of universal participation. China rejects attempts of the US and some other countries to politicize the issue of data security, elbow out countries with different views in the name of the so-called Clean Network program, and prey on enterprises of other countries under the pretext of security.China has recently put forward the Global Initiative on Data Security with a view to addressing data security risks and challenges, safeguarding global data and supply chain security, and promoting digital economic development and cooperation. China's initiative calls on all states to oppose using ICT activities to impair other States' critical infrastructure or steal important data, oppose abusing ICT to conduct mass surveillance against other States, desist from requesting domestic companies to store data generated and obtained overseas in one's own territory, and ask ICT products and services providers not to install back-doors in their products and services. China's initiative aims to serve as a basis for international rules-making on data security, and is also a commitment of China to safeguarding global data security. China hopes that all parties could support this initiative, and we are open to good ideas and suggestions from all sides. China supports the work of the UN OEWG and UN GGE and hope that these processes will make further progress.The current security situation in outer space is increasingly challenging. In particular, the US has been pursuing a strategy for dominance in space, blatantly termed outer space as a new war-fighting domain, and has even established an independent Space Force and the Space Command. The US also plans to deploy missile defense system in outer space. These US moves accelerate the militarization and weaponization of outer space and therefore are the most prominent factors affecting outer space security. China urges the US to stop impeding international arms control process on outer space, and join international efforts for negotiation and conclusion of an international legal instrument based on the draft PPWT proposed by China and Russia, so as to fundamentally safeguard lasting peace and common security in outer space.The rapid development of the military application of Artificial Intelligence (AI) may give rise to security, humanitarian, legal and ethical concerns. Paying high attention to these issues, China is supportive of having in-depth international discussions aimed at exploring effective measures to address the associated risks and ensuring that AI technology will benefit all mankind. China also supports continued in-depth discussions on Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems (LAWS) within the framework of Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW), with the purpose of negotiating a legally-binding international instrument.Mr. Chairman,China acceded to the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) on 6 July this year. This is a significant step taken by China in its active efforts to promote global arms trade governance and to safeguard international and regional peace and security. This testifies to China's sincerity in upholding multilateralism and building a community with a shared future for mankind. As a State Party to the ATT, China will faithfully fulfill its obligations, and work closely with all parties to promote the universality and effectiveness of the ATT. In this connection, China is ready to provide assistance to the developing countries within its capacity. China attaches great importance to African concerns about the illicit trafficking in small arms and light weapons, and supports the African Union's initiative of "Silencing the Guns in Africa". To this end, China has provided USD 1.4 million through the United Nations Peace and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019. Standing ready to carry out further cooperation with the AU and African countries in this regard, China also calls upon the international community to provide needed assistance to Africa. Meanwhile, we urge all countries to stop arms sales to non-state actors, and refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of sovereign states through arms exports.Mr. Chairman,No matter how grave the international security situation may become, as long as we stay committed to upholding multilateralism, strengthening mutual trust and coordination centered on the UN, and building a community with a shared future for mankind, we would be able to make progress in international arms control, disarmament and nonproliferation. China is ready to join hands with other members of the international community to make unremitting efforts towards this end.Thank you, Mr. Chairman.A Chinese envoy said on Monday that asking China to participate in the "trilateral arms control negotiation" is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible.Geng Shuang, head of the Chinese delegation and deputy permanent representative of China to the United Nations, rejected the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" recently hyped up by the United States, in his statement delivered at the general debate of the First Committee of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA).Geng pointed out that recently the United States named China as "the third largest nuclear power on Earth," hyped up "nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia and China" and proposed the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation.""This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community. The U.S. intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy," he said.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country, said the envoy."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he added."China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail," Geng added.The ambassador emphasized that China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process."Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons," he noted.China has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, said the envoy."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council) country who has made such commitments," Geng noted."China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5," the ambassador stressed.The First Committee, also known as the Disarmament and International Security Committee, is one of six main committees of the UNGA. It deals with disarmament and international security matters.The committee meets every year in October for a 4-5 week session, after the UNGA General Debate. All 193 member states of the United Nations can attend.Statement of H. E. Mr. Geng Shuang, Head of the Chinese Delegation and Deputy Permanent Representative at the General Debate of the First Committee of the 75th Session of the UNGA(From Chinese Mission to the United Nations)2020/10/12Mr. Chairman,First of all, please allow me to extend, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, my congratulations to Your Excellency on your election as Chairman of the First Committee of the current session of the UN General Assembly. The Chinese delegation wishes to assure you and other delegations of its full support and cooperation to make this session of the committee a full success.Mr. Chairman,The global strategic security and arms control situation today is faced with the gravest challenge since the Cold War. To maintain its supremacy as the sole super power, the US has reverted to the Cold War mentality, hyped up major power competition and stoked major power confrontation. These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability.For the past years, to develop military capabilities without constraint, the US has continuously withdrawn from international treaties, sabotaging the multilateral and bilateral arms control and disarmament regime built up gradually after the WWII. The US is investing trillions of US dollars to modernize its nuclear Triad, developing and deploying low-yield nuclear weapons, and expanding the scope of nuclear deterrence. The US has also lowered the threshold for the use of nuclear weapons, and even discussed the resumption of nuclear tests. We urge the US to faithfully fulfill its special and primary responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, positively respond to Russia's appeal for the extension of the New START Treaty, and further substantially reduce its nuclear arsenal, so as to create conditions for other Nuclear Weapon States to join multilateral nuclear disarmament.The unrestrained development and deployment of a global missile defense system by the US as well as its attempts to deploy land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific and Europe, not only pose threats to China's security, but also undermine regional peace and security and disrupt global strategic stability. China is gravely concerned and urges the US to stop relevant deployments. Should the US continue to go down this path, China will take forceful countermeasures in defense of its own national interests when necessary.The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) is the cornerstone of the international disarmament and non-proliferation architecture. At present, the US has gone to extremes to shift responsibilities for nuclear disarmament, exercise double standards in violation of international law on non-proliferation issues, and manipulate the peaceful use of nuclear energy for political purposes, putting all the three pillars of the NPT under unprecedented strain. On the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the entry into force of NPT, China calls on all parties to take this as an opportunity to reaffirm the treaty obligations and commitments made in the outcome documents of previous review conferences, and work for progress on the three pillars of NPT in a balanced manner. address the differences and disputes constructively, so as to achieve pragmatic outcomes at the 10th Review Conference.Recently the US named China as "the third largest nuclear power on earth", hyped up "nuclear arms race between the US, Russia and China" and proposed so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation". This is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community. The US intention is to find an excuse to shirk its own special and primary responsibility for nuclear disarmament, and seek a pretext to free its hands and gain absolute military supremacy.China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in any nuclear arms race with any other country. Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the US and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation. China will never participate in such a negotiation and will never accept any coercion or blackmail.China's rejection of the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation" does not mean that China evades its own responsibility for nuclear disarmament or refuses to participate in the global nuclear disarmament process. Ever since the first day of possessing nuclear weapons, China has been advocating the complete prohibition and thorough destruction of nuclear weapons. China has declared the policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against Non-Nuclear-Weapon States or Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones. China is the only P5 country who makes such commitments. China firmly abides by its commitments on the moratorium of nuclear tests, and supports the development of the verification mechanism of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT). China supports negotiation for a treaty banning the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices on the basis of a comprehensive and balanced program of work in accordance with the mandate contained in the Shannon Report, and supports the work of the UN Group of Governmental Experts on Nuclear Disarmament Verification. China is ready to engage in meaningful dialogue on the issues related to strategic stability with all parties on the basis of mutual respect, and will continue its participation in the arms control process under the framework of the United Nations, the Conference on Disarmament and the P5.In the face of the increasingly complex and ominous international security landscape, the P5 should take proactive measures to manage differences, and work together to maintain global strategic stability. Since the Beijing Conference in January last year, the P5 have reached consensus on carrying out cooperation on strategic security issues including nuclear doctrines and policies, nuclear risk reduction, etc. China suggests that the P5 continue to strengthen dialogue on nuclear policies and doctrines, jointly reiterate that "A nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought", make a commitment not to target their nuclear weapons at any State, commit to the no-first-use of nuclear weapons unconditionally, and conclude legally binding international instruments on providing negative and positive security assurances to non-nuclear weapon States. We urge the US to abandon the policies of nuclear umbrella and nuclear sharing, withdraw all the nuclear weapons deployed overseas, stop the development and deployment of its global missile defense system, and play a due role in improving international and regional security environment.Mr. Chairman,The root cause of the current tensions related to the Iran nuclear issue is the US unilateral withdrawal from the JCPOA, re-imposition of illegal unilateral sanctions against Iran, and blocking other parties from fulfilling their obligations under the JCPOA. Having withdrawn from the JCPOA, the US has no right to trigger the Security Council snap-back mechanism, and its unilateral announcement on restoration of the UNSC sanctions against Iran has no legal validity whatsoever. It is imperative that all relevant parties resolve differences over the implementation of the JCPOA through dialogue and consultation within the framework of the Joint Commission focusing on restoring the balance of rights and obligations. China attaches high importance to the concerns of relevant parties over regional security issues, and advocates, on the premise of preserving the JCPOA, the establishment of an alternative multilateral dialogue platform with the purpose of building new consensus on maintaining peace and stability in the region.The US bears the responsibility for the deadlock of the DPRK-US dialogue regarding the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. China urges the US to show sincerity and respond with concrete actions to the DPRK's legitimate concerns over security and development, so as to bring the Peninsular nuclear issue back to the track of dialogue. China is committed to upholding the denuclearization, peace and stability of the Peninsula, and to resolving the issue through dialogue and consultation. China is firmly opposed to unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction beyond the mandates of the UNSC resolutions and to any attempt by forces outside the region to use the Peninsula issue as an excuse to beef up military deployment in the region. China will continue to play a constructive role in the political settlement of the Peninsula issue.Mr. Chairman,The sudden outbreak of COVID-19 has sounded the alarm on bio-security and highlighted the importance and urgency of strengthening global bio-security governance. In this connection, China wishes to make the following points. First, all parties should faithfully fulfill their due obligations under the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC). The international community is highly concerned with the US military's biological programs. We urge the US to act in an open, transparent and responsible manner and fully clarify its activities in numerous bio-labs overseas. Second, efforts should be made to resume negotiation for a verification protocol under BWC framework in order to put in place an effective international verification mechanism for the sake of safeguarding bio-security. We hope that such a decision can be made at next year's BWC Review Conference. We once again urge the US to stop impeding the resumption of negotiation. Third, it is necessary to set up a scientific advisory body within the framework of BWC and develop a voluntary code of conduct, in order to better regulate bio-research activities and promote the sound development of bio-technologies. Fourth, it is time to establish a fair and inclusive non-proliferation, export control and international cooperation regime under the framework of the BWC, remove discriminatory barriers, ensure developing countries' rights to the dividends of bio-technologies and jointly lift global bio-security to a new level.As the only possessor of chemical weapon stockpile, the US should earnestly fulfill its obligations under the CWC and expedite the destruction of its chemical weapons stockpile.

"For instance, Smederevo steel mill is one of the examples of joint victory."In 2016, Serbia's only steel mill was saved from bankruptcy by the Chinese HBIS group. Thanks to that intervention, over 12,000 workers kept their jobs.However, amid uncertain progress in EU membership talks, Serbia is also courting the U.S. as it seeks international allies, placing it in the middle of tense relations between east and west.  Vucic recently visited Washington to sign an agreement with the U.S. vowing not to use 5G equipment from "suspicious sources." This came just weeks after the U.S. banned Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei, claiming it could compromise national security.Vucic said: "We already had various pressures and we know it is not easy to maintain a friendship with China. But so far, Serbia [has been] successful in maintaining it. We'll keep our freedom of choices, and we'll continue to build a sincere friendship with the People's Republic of China."    Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi hailed Serbia as a "true and great friend" after meeting President Aleksandar Vucic and his leading ministers.Yang Jiechi also praised Serbia's economic development and said China would continue to encourage its companies to invest in Serbia and help to maintain its economic growth. The two nations have established an increasingly close relationship, with Serbia receiving large shipments of medical aid from China to help its fight against COVID-19.Now, Yang Jiechi says the focus of the two nations is to map out their future economic relationship, which he believes will benefit both parties.  "Regarding practical cooperation between China and Serbia, it is proven to be mutually beneficial," he said.

"China's reform and opening-up, as well as its development and construction, are inseparable from the large number of overseas Chinese who care about their motherland," he said.The old downtown area of Shantou witnessed the city's opening-up. Xi visited the Shantou Opening Port Culture Exhibition Hall, where he learned about Shantou's history since it opened a wharf in the 19th century, and the Qiaopi Museum in Kaibu District, which houses many "qiaopi" or letters from overseas Chinese to their families in China. The Qiaopi Museum has so far collected some 30,000 original copies and 30,000 photocopies of the letters. Xi spoke highly of the role that overseas Chinese have played in China's reform and opening-up.The group of people "with a Chinese heart" love their country and hometown deeply, and they made a huge contribution to China's opening-up and economic growth, Xi said.Read more:'Reform and opening-up' remains theme of Xi Jinping's visit to China's Guangdong Province Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Tuesday that he came to Guangdong to send a clear message that the Communist Party of China (CPC) will continue to lead China on the path of reform and opening-up.Xi, also general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks to a crowd of local people in the old downtown area in Shantou City, south China's Guangdong Province. Growing from a 1.6-square-kilometer suburban area into a modern coastal city, the Shantou Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in southern China's Guangdong Province is a paragon of the country's development through reform and opening-up over the past 40 years. The Shantou SEZ, founded in 1980, now covers 2,064 square kilometers on the eastern coast of Guangdong. "I'm here in Guangdong to show both China and the world that the Communist Party of China will firmly continue to lead the Chinese people to walk down the road of reform and opening-up," Xi told the crowd.The CPC will strive for the prosperity of the country and the well-being of the Chinese people and endeavor to realize the national rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, he said.The Chinese president also affirmed the contribution of overseas Chinese to the country.

They were of the view that these discussions were positive, constructive and had enhanced understanding of each other's positions," said the statement.According to the statement, the two sides agreed to maintain dialogue and communication through military and diplomatic channels in order to find a "mutually acceptable solution" for the lasting standoff."Both sides agreed to earnestly implement the important understandings reached by the leaders of the two countries, not to turn differences into disputes, and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas," said the statement.The meeting, began on Monday, is the seventh round of commander-level talks between the two sides. During the sixth round of military talks, military officials of the two sides agreed to stop sending more troops in the border areas.Tensions between the two sides rose in April, as the Chinese Defense Ministry claimed that the Indian border troops have unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities in the Galwan Valley on the Chinese side, blocked the Chinese troops' patrol in an attempt to unilaterally change the status of the border control. It soon escalated after the two sides clashed on June 15, causing a total of 20 Indian deaths.Read more:Chinese Defense Ministry blames India for border clash: it 'unilaterally' violates consensusChina opposes India building bridges, warns of further tension in border areasChina and India reached a five-point consensus regarding the current situation in early September of which the two countries agreed to ease tension and not allowing differences to become disputes.India's consistent enhancement of its infrastructures and deployment of forces in the area is recognized as the leading cause of the tension, as Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday after India announced it had opened 44 bridges in the border areas."We urged the Indian side to fully implement the consensuses reached by the two sides, stop taking any actions that may worsen the situation and maintain peace and stability in the region with concrete efforts," said Zhao in a daily briefing.China and India held "positive, constructive" discussions on disengaging troops locked in a months-long standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Western Sector of China-India border areas, said the Chinese Defense Ministry in a statement on Tuesday."The two sides had a sincere, in-depth and constructive exchange of views on disengagement along the Line of Actual Control in the Western Sector of China-India border areas.

However, some high-profile cases involving violent crimes committed by underage youths in recent years have sparked a heated debate on the minimum age of criminal liability.Besides, statistics from the country's top procuratorate raised concerns over juvenile crimes.

It's one of few key states in the age of mass mail-in voting likely to report on November 3, and if Biden wins its 29 Electoral College votes, the election will be as good as over.CGTN analysis of public polling indicates the former vice president is up by 3.4 points in Florida and over eight points nationally, with female, older and suburban voters moving towards him. Biden has built up a lead with seniors, the most reliable voting bloc, as the pandemic has progressed.While the first presidential debate looks to have hurt Trump in the polls, the only lasting impact from the vice-presidential clash between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Mike Pence is the slew of memes that emerged after a fly perched for two minutes on the vice president's head.Snap polls suggested Harris was the winner of a low-key debate which was quickly forgotten as the president returned to center stage. Whether Biden and Trump will square up again in person remains unclear â the president has refused to debate virtually and so the second event, scheduled for this week, has been cancelled.The third planned debate, now the second, is still due to go ahead on October 22 and could be the final opportunity for Trump to try to knock the risk-averse Biden campaign off course.Video: Wang Zengzheng and Zhou TingyuScript: John GoodrichScan the QR code in the video above to check out CGTN's U.S. election interactive special for exclusive data as well as the latest news, explainers, cartoons and analysis.With three weeks until election day in the United States more than 10 million Americans have already voted and CGTN analysis suggests Joe Biden has pulled further ahead of Donald Trump in the national polls.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionHere are the highlights from the past seven days.Trump returned to the White House after his COVID-19 hospitalization, released a series of videos, conducted phone or recorded interviews with Fox News, addressed a crowd on the South Lawn on Saturday, and then got into a spat with Anthony Fauci before returning to the campaign trail in Florida on Monday.The president, desperate to return to in-person events, insisted he was "immune" from the virus on Sunday in a tweet which was flagged for spreading "misleading and potentially harmful information" as the U.S. continued to report over 40,000 new COVID-19 cases per day.Confirmation of a negative test did not come until Trump was en route to Monday's rally, the first of a series of swing state campaign stops â Axios reported that the Republican wants to hold a rally every day until November 3.Polling numbers for Trump have gone from bad to worse since the first presidential debate and his COVID-19 diagnosis.Seemingly low on funds, the president's campaign is cutting advertising spending and hoping for a free media boost from rallies just as Biden, flush with cash, broadens his own ad buys: the Democrat splashed out $40 million to Trump's $23 million over the past week.Florida is yet again shaping up to be the race to watch.

negotiation" with the U.S. and Russia as the U.S. intends to avoid its own responsibility in nuclear disarmament.  The U.S. named China "the third largest nuclear power on Earth," hyped up the "nuclear arms race between the U.S., Russia and China" and proposed the so-called "trilateral arms control negotiation," which is just a trick to shift the focus of the international community, said Geng, the head of the Chinese delegation and deputy permanent representative of China to the United Nations.Speaking during the general debate of the First Committee of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly (UNGA), Geng called the trilateral arms control talks "coercion" and "blackmail," saying China will never be part of such negotiation. China has pursued a nuclear strategy of self-defense, always kept its nuclear capabilities at the minimum level required for its national security, and has never and will never take part in a nuclear arms race with any other country, Geng said."Given the huge gap between the nuclear arsenals of China and those of the U.S. and the Russian Federation, it is unfair, unreasonable and infeasible to expect China to join in any trilateral arms control negotiation," he continued.But the Chinese representative said China is pursuing its responsibility to push forward nuclear disarmament.China signed the UN-led Arms Trade Treaty (ATT) spurned by the U.S. in July, Geng noted, saying it's a "significant" step taken by his country.The ATT regulates a 70 billion-U.S.-dollar global cross-border trade in conventional arms and seeks to keep weapons out of the hands of human rights abusers.Then-U.S. President Barack Obama's administration signed it, but it was opposed by the National Rifle Association and never ratified by the U.S. Senate.In July 2019, the United States told UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres that Washington did not intend to become a party to the treaty and that it had no legal obligations from its 2013 signature.Naming the United States, Geng said the U.S. is reverted to the Cold War mentality and launched acts of unilateralism and confrontation."These hegemonic unilateral acts have posed the gravest threat to global strategic security and stability."Geng noted that China has provided $1.4 million through the United Nations Peace and Development Fund in 2018 and 2019 to help reduce illicit trafficking of small weapons in African countries.China also has declared the policy of "no-first-use" of nuclear weapons at any time and under any circumstances, and unconditionally commits itself not to use or threaten to use nuclear weapons against non-nuclear-weapon states or nuclear-weapon-free zones, Geng said."China is the only P5 (five permanent members of the UN Security Council)

Many Republicans have followed the lead of President Donald Trump, who has regularly castigated voting by mail, while the party's leadership in some states has offered mixed messages about when supporters should vote.While millions of people are choosing to vote by mail this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic, others are opting for in-person early voting.Recent controversies including criticism by the Trump administration over the U.S. Postal Service and doubts about the acceptance of ballots are leading some to head to the polls in-person. In Virginia, early voting began September 28th. Officials say election workers are receiving about 2,000 mail-in ballots per day and hundreds are lining up to vote in-person. More than 890,000 people have already cast ballots by voting in person, by mail or drop box."We're probably looking at three times the rate for early voting that we saw in 2016," said Gary D.

The LA Times reports, fear was a common factor among reasons why people decided to vote early. Voters were worried their mail-in ballots wouldnât arrive on time, get lost or election officials would stop counting.In Georgia, early in-person voting began Monday. Thousands of people turned out in long lines. Voters in Fulton County faced technical glitches that temporarily stopped voting but officials were able to clear the lines by mid-morning.CNN reports the state of Ohio has received almost 2.2 million ballot requests... double those from early October 2016.Considering millions have already cast their votes early, experts predict a record turnout for the election. National opinion polls show Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in the lead over Trump. But as officials brace for an influx of mail-in ballots compared to previous elections, they are also warning, Americans might not have a final result by the end of the night on November 3rd. Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

Pubs and bars will close temporarily and socializing prohibited indoors, but universities and retail shops will stay open.High level measures will be applied to Manchester and Nottinghamshire, meaning socializing indoors will be banned and the rule of six applied in outdoor settings, but pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open, as across the rest of the country, until 10 p.m.  Those areas placed on the medium tier will continue to follow national guidelines, with bars and pubs closing at 10 p.m. and the rule of six applied outdoors.The UK government response is for England only, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland implementing their own strategies to deal with the pandemic.Johnson says the new system is designed to avoid another national lockdown, which he says would cause long-term economic damage."This is not how we want to live our lives," he said. "But it is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic costs of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."  Johnson added: "The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country. I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed."The prime minister and his scientific advisers will continue to monitor the number of cases in each area, which could lead to an increasing number of towns and cities facing the most severe measures.England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained why cases of COVID-19 have risen so sharply the north of England compared with the rest of the country. "The epidemic this time has clearly picked up pace in the north of England earlier than it did in the first wave and that almost certainly relates to the fact that disease levels in the north never dropped, and certainly in the northwest, they never dropped as far as they dropped in the summer as they did in the south."Johnson also announced a further economic package would be introduced to replace the furlough scheme, which comes to an end at the end of this month. The support will cover two-thirds of the wages for employees of businesses forced to close as a result of the new virus restrictions.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a new three-level COVID-19 alert system across England as cases continue to rise across the country.Infection rates have quadrupled in England in the past month, and hospital admissions have doubled. The new system will apply localized measures of varying severity to the worst-hit areas of the country, with regions placed into one of three levels â medium, high or very high. Liverpool has been placed in the very high level with measures set to be imposed from Wednesday.

establishing a republic following the abrupt departure abroad of former King Juan Carlos amid a cloud of scandal, according to an opinion poll.The 82-year-old former monarch has been living in the United Arab Emirates since he left Spain in August to avoid causing further embarrassment to his son, King Felipe VI.Of the respondents, 40.9 percent said they preferred a republic, while 34.9 percent said they supported the royal family and 24.2 percent said they did not know, according to the survey for the Platform for Independent Media, a group of mainly left-wing media.The poll, which questioned 3,000 people, also found 48 percent want a referendum on the monarchy, which under Spain's constitution is the only way to decide the fate of the institution, while 25 percent were opposed and 16.1 percent did not know.  A poll published in August for the pro-monarchy ABC newspaper found 33.5 percent favouring a republic and 56 percent the monarchy, while six percent did not know and 4.1 percent were indifferent.While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos could become a target in two inquiries in Spain and Switzerland into alleged corruption associated with a $9.9 billion, high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms.Spain's supreme court prosecutor is considering whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to formally involve Juan

holiday when King Felipe will lead a reduced celebration due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was commissioned after the government's Centre for Sociological Investigations declined to question Spaniards about the monarchy in its most recent poll.Defence Minister Margarita Robles said the monarchy was an "essential part of the constitutional pact," speaking in an interview published on Monday in

establishing a republic following the abrupt departure abroad of former King Juan Carlos amid a cloud of scandal, according to an opinion poll.The 82-year-old former monarch has been living in the United Arab Emirates since he left Spain in August to avoid causing further embarrassment to his son, King Felipe VI.Of the respondents, 40.9 percent said they preferred a republic, while 34.9 percent said they supported the royal family and 24.2 percent said they did not know, according to the survey for the Platform for Independent Media, a group of mainly left-wing media.The poll, which questioned 3,000 people, also found 48 percent want a referendum on the monarchy, which under Spain's constitution is the only way to decide the fate of the institution, while 25 percent were opposed and 16.1 percent did not know.  A poll published in August for the pro-monarchy ABC newspaper found 33.5 percent favouring a republic and 56 percent the monarchy, while six percent did not know and 4.1 percent were indifferent.While not formally under investigation, Juan Carlos could become a target in two inquiries in Spain and Switzerland into alleged corruption associated with a $9.9 billion, high-speed Saudi train contract won by Spanish firms.Spain's supreme court prosecutor is considering whether to extend a corruption investigation into the train contract to formally involve Juan
