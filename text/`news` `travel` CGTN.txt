An architectural wonder of its age, it was built in the 18th and 19th centuries during the Qing Dynasty (1636-1911). British and French forces destroyed the place on October 18 and 19, 1860, during the Second Opium War, a move to force China to open its market.A special activity marks 160th anniversaryIn order to allow visitors to explore the Old Summer Palace more deeply, the park has launched the "Old Summer Palace Passport," which can be purchased at stores in the park or at Tmall and JD.com stores. There are 51 classic attractions of the Old Summer Palace on this "passport." Visitors can find the seals from shops near the corresponding attractions on the map on the front page of the passport.After collecting all 51 seals, one from each attraction, visitors can get a special seal. "This seal is the symbol of treasure coming into and going out of the Old Summer Palace. Completing the seal collection is like bringing the Old Summer Palace home," said a personnel who works at the park.According to officials, each seal has been custom-made for the 160th anniversary of the massive loot.Will the Old Summer Palace be rebuilt?As many as 160 years ago, the Old Summer Palace, known as the "garden of gardens," was looted and burned down by Western powers. Numerous treasures disappeared and the famous garden was gradually abandoned. Later, the Old Summer Palace was turned into a park, but it remained as it was when it was destroyed. As the restoration work continues, some experts and scholars say the Old Summer Palace needs a museum to store items that behold precious historical memories. What is the fate of the cultural relics? Should we keep it original or restore it? Experts and scholars have different views on this.Experts estimate that millions of looted cultural relics are scattered around the world and China, and the ones in the country are mainly concentrated in Beijing. Since the establishment of the management office of the Old Summer Palace in 1976, experts and scholars have been trying to trace the lost relics. Nowadays, access to information is expanding, providing more clues for finding cultural relics.In September 2007, Macao gaming tycoon Stanley Ho Hung-sun purchased the bronze statue of the horse head of Yuanmingyuan at a price of HK$69.1 million.

There have always been two completely different views: keeping the original appearance and reflecting the history of the changes; and restoring its glory as it was in its heyday.The Old Summer Palace management office, at the center of the controversy, has been trying to explore this issue.

They have special visas that allow them to stay for 90 days with the option to renew twice. The first 14 days have to be spent in quarantine.Among other stipulations, they also need to have proof of travel insurance and medical insurance for in and outpatient treatment, as well as for treatment for COVID-19.After landing, their papers were checked, and their temperatures were taken before they were allowed through immigration. In all, they had to pass through three thermoscans as they walked through the airport, according to airport authorities. As they queued to board buses, workers in protective clothing disinfected their luggage."We can assure everyone that all our measures are systematic and meet international standards," said the airport's deputy general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn.Chinese tourists were seen putting on raincoats as the last step before leaving for their quarantine accommodation. Kittipong said this was not a government requirement, but rather, he said, the raincoats appeared to have been part of a complimentary package of items from their hotel.Almost 40 million people visited Thailand in 2019, with tourism accounting for more than 10 percent of the country's GDP.

But such requirements have drawn criticism from a minority that has complained of having their liberty suppressed."In those situations where a customer declines to wear a face covering, we'll put in place additional procedures to take care of them in a friendly, expedited way," McDonald's said, adding that it will help its employees get training "to ensure they are prepared to address this new policy in a friendly and positive way."Customers who come into a McDonald's restaurant without a mask will be offered one by a worker, a McDonald's representative told NPR.

A maximum of five stamps are allowed per customer.But, as they say, there's no such thing as a free lunch.

Sweden banned large gatherings, closed high schools and colleges and promoted social distancing.

It has the fifth highest mortality rate in the world with 53.35 per 100,000 people.The light-touch strategy has drawn criticism from neighboring countries, with many still not welcoming Swedish tourists even after re-opening their borders to each other's nationals and to arrivals from nations further afield.But things might be taking a turn for the better, and the country on Tuesday recorded only 238 new infections, the lowest daily tally since May.Officials are betting that the downward trend of coronavirus cases could convince more countries to allow Swedes in â and that means passports can soon come in handy.

But now, digital technology has brought these cultural heritage sites together in one place.The first joint exhibition of China's three major grottoes, namely Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang, northwest China's Gansu Province, Longmen Grottoes in Luoyang, central China's Henan Province and Yungang Grottoes in Datong, north China's Shanxi Province, is currently underway in the city of Luoyang.The exhibition breaks the space barrier of these immovable cultural relics and displays the exquisite carving and painting skills of the grottoes, their rich history as well as the protection of cultural heritage by making use of 3D printing, VR, and other digital technologies.Professor Jia Zhuofei from Xi'an Jiaotong University said the digital technology has opened up a new field in the research and display of these cultural relics, allowing visitors to appreciate the unique charm of the ancient treasures."VR technology has made a major breakthrough in terms of displaying the destroyed grottoes," said Shi Jiazhen, head of the research institute of the Longmen Grottoes, referring to the virtual restoration of the destroyed Buddha statues. The VR display enables viewers to see the original look of the over 1,000-year-old figures.Mogao Grottoes, Longmen Grottoes, and Yungang Grottoes were listed as the UNESCO World Heritage sites in 1987, 2000, and 2001, respectively. This year also marks the 20th anniversary of Longmen Grottoes being included in the list.Co-hosted by the three grottoes sites' research institutes, the exhibition is held at Luoyang Museum and lasts for three months until January 18, 2021.(Cover: An exhibition on China's three major grottoes is held at Luoyang Museum, Luoyang, central China's Henan Province, October 20, 2020. /CFP)The ancient Chinese grottoes have long been widely acclaimed as treasures along the Silk Road, scattered across the country.

The federal government will meet on Friday afternoon to discuss a raft of new tightening measures. Options include a France-like curfew for all citizens, mandating telework, reducing social contacts outside the home to one and forcing all restaurants to close at 11 p.m.. Bars and cafes across the country are already on reduced hours. A full lockdown is off the table for now, but experts and ministers have warned that if infections don't make a U-turn, a further shutting down of society won't be ruled out. The EUEU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen was forced to duck out of a critical leaders' summit on Thursday after a member of her staff tested positive for the coronavirus. She headed into self-isolation, but not before hosting bilateral meetings with the prime ministers of Portugal and Czechia. She said in a tweet that she had tested negative. She's the third high-ranking official to be sidelined by COVID-19. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki didn't come to Brussels for the summit and is reportedly self-isolating after coming into contact with an infected person, while Finland's leader Sanna Marin left the council on Friday morning after becoming aware she had come into contact with someone who tested positive. A resurgence in coronavirus cases across the continent has led many to question why the leaders would risk meeting in person. But Council president Charles Michel defended the move, saying face-to-face meetings are imperative when important issues are up for discussion. The leaders are meeting for two days to discuss Brexit, COVID-19 and escalating tensions with Turkey.  Jemima Walker in LondonMillions of people across England are facing tougher coronavirus restrictions later on Friday, as rates of infection continue to rise.

Pubs and bars will close temporarily and socializing prohibited indoors, but universities and retail shops will stay open.High level measures will be applied to Manchester and Nottinghamshire, meaning socializing indoors will be banned and the rule of six applied in outdoor settings, but pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open, as across the rest of the country, until 10 p.m.  Those areas placed on the medium tier will continue to follow national guidelines, with bars and pubs closing at 10 p.m. and the rule of six applied outdoors.The UK government response is for England only, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland implementing their own strategies to deal with the pandemic.Johnson says the new system is designed to avoid another national lockdown, which he says would cause long-term economic damage."This is not how we want to live our lives," he said. "But it is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic costs of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."  Johnson added: "The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country. I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed."The prime minister and his scientific advisers will continue to monitor the number of cases in each area, which could lead to an increasing number of towns and cities facing the most severe measures.England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained why cases of COVID-19 have risen so sharply the north of England compared with the rest of the country. "The epidemic this time has clearly picked up pace in the north of England earlier than it did in the first wave and that almost certainly relates to the fact that disease levels in the north never dropped, and certainly in the northwest, they never dropped as far as they dropped in the summer as they did in the south."Johnson also announced a further economic package would be introduced to replace the furlough scheme, which comes to an end at the end of this month. The support will cover two-thirds of the wages for employees of businesses forced to close as a result of the new virus restrictions.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a new three-level COVID-19 alert system across England as cases continue to rise across the country.Infection rates have quadrupled in England in the past month, and hospital admissions have doubled. The new system will apply localized measures of varying severity to the worst-hit areas of the country, with regions placed into one of three levels â medium, high or very high. Liverpool has been placed in the very high level with measures set to be imposed from Wednesday.

Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home. Jason Huth, an English teacher in Beijing, was one who decided not to travel during the holiday. "I chose to stay for a few reasons; partly because I had just got back to Beijing a few weeks ago after being stuck abroad since Chinese New Year, partly because my school strongly advised teachers not to travel too far away from Beijing due to fears of having to quarantine upon return."Many international schools and companies advised staff against travel during the break. Aletta Magrieta Strauss, a Beijing-based art teacher, said she thought this was reasonable. "If there was an outbreak and I had to quarantine as a result, work would not cover the cost. They (international schools) have already lost a lot of money and are still trying to get staff back into China."With many people having extra money to spend due to not traveling earlier in the year, and with the onus being on safety and comfort, high-end hotels saw a boom in business. Of all hotel bookings made on Trip.com during the October holiday, four- and five-star accommodation accounted for nearly half. It's anticipated that the effect will be lasting, as more people get used to the idea of "luxury staycations."This year's October holiday saw a resurgence in domestic tourism, with 637 million trips being recorded in eight days.

The contest is worth 10 million yuan.Sanxingdui Museum has two exhibition halls totaling 10,800 square meters. With the continuous archaeological finds at Sanxingdui Ruins, the existing halls can no longer accommodate new cultural relics. For this reason, the museum has decided to build a new one.Officials have been reported as saying that the project solicitation area is about 35,000 square meters. That includes the new exhibition area of about 30,000 square meters, a visitor center construction area of about 5,000 square meters and a series of ancillary projects for an estimated total investment of 1.06 billion yuan.Sanxingdui Museum is situated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site by the bank of the Yazi River in Guanghan â a city famed for its long history.The Sanxingdui Ruins site, which dates back 4800-2600 years, has a distribution area of 12 square kilometers. Its discovery provides unique physical evidence of the vanished ancient Shu Kingdom and showcases the Yangtze River basin as a cradle of Chinese civilization like the Yellow River basin. Besides, it is regarded as "the source of Yangtze civilization" and "the ninth wonder of the world."Sanxingdui Ruins was listed among "Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level" in 1988 and "the first batch of national archeological parks" in 2010. Now, it has been included in the Tentative List of China's World Cultural Heritages.The Sanxingdui civilization is world-class and an important part of the pluralistic integration of Chinese civilization. The new Sanxingdui Museum is an important part of the construction of the Sanxingdui National Cultural Relic Protection and Utilization Demonstration Area and its proposed declaration as a World Cultural Heritage site, the project organizer said in the invitation for design entries."We are looking forward to making the new Sanxingdui Museum a symbol of the combination of international style and Chinese style. We sincerely invite outstanding creative design teams and individuals from all over the world to participate in this project solicitation," said Zhu Jiake, the executive deputy director of the museum.This global solicitation award accumulates to 10 million yuan. The specific requirements were announced on the Sanxingdui Museum's official website on October 10.(Cover: The Sanxingdui Museum, a modern theme museum 40 kilometers to the north of Chengdu, China. /CFP)China's Sanxingdui Museum, a modern theme museum 40 kilometers north of the city of Chengdu, has started global solicitation for conceptual architectural designs for a new hall to house its Ancient Shu Cultural Relics and Ancillary Facilities Project.

For this reason, the museum has decided to build a new one.Officials have been reported as saying that the project solicitation area is about 35,000 square meters. That includes the new exhibition area of about 30,000 square meters, a visitor center construction area of about 5,000 square meters and a series of ancillary projects for an estimated total investment of 1.06 billion yuan.Sanxingdui Museum is situated in the northeast of the state-protected Sanxingdui Site by the bank of the Yazi River in Guanghan â a city famed for its long history.The Sanxingdui Ruins site, which dates back 4800-2600 years, has a distribution area of 12 square kilometers. Its discovery provides unique physical evidence of the vanished ancient Shu Kingdom and showcases the Yangtze River basin as a cradle of Chinese civilization like the Yellow River basin. Besides, it is regarded as "the source of Yangtze civilization" and "the ninth wonder of the world."Sanxingdui Ruins was listed among "Major Historical and Cultural Sites Protected at the National Level" in 1988 and "the first batch of national archeological parks" in 2010. Now, it has been included in the Tentative List of China's World Cultural Heritages.The Sanxingdui civilization is world-class and an important part of the pluralistic integration of Chinese civilization. The new Sanxingdui Museum is an important part of the construction of the Sanxingdui National Cultural Relic Protection and Utilization Demonstration Area and its proposed declaration as a World Cultural Heritage site, the project organizer said in the invitation for design entries."We are looking forward to making the new Sanxingdui Museum a symbol of the combination of international style and Chinese style. We sincerely invite outstanding creative design teams and individuals from all over the world to participate in this project solicitation," said Zhu Jiake, the executive deputy director of the museum.This global solicitation award accumulates to 10 million yuan. The specific requirements were announced on the Sanxingdui Museum's official website on October 10.(Cover: The Sanxingdui Museum, a modern theme museum 40 kilometers to the north of Chengdu, China. /CFP)Cape Verde is set to reopen its borders on Monday, the government said, after the coronavirus pandemic forced the archipelago state to close to visitors for months.Visitors to the West African country will have to provide proof of a negative coronavirus result from a high-precision molecular test, known as a PCR test."The government has decided that the time has come to restore full air links with the outside world," Transport Minister Carlos Santos said during a press conference on Friday.Cruise ships and commercial vessels will also be able to dock in Cape Verde from Monday, he added.Sunseekers have traditionally flocked to the 10-island archipelago, where tourism represents about a quarter of its GDP.The former Portuguese colony's high season falls over the winter months.The government banned commercial flights after the outbreak of the pandemic, but initial plans to lift the restrictions in July were delayed.Health officials in Cape Verde have since recorded some 6,700 coronavirus cases to date, including 71 fatalities.Transport Minister Santos said the country had strengthened its testing capabilities ahead of its reopening, including establishing testing centres on the islands of Sal and Boa Vista â both tourist draws.Cape Verde is set to reopen its borders on Monday, the government said, after the coronavirus pandemic forced the archipelago state to close to visitors for months.Visitors to the West African country will have to provide proof of a negative coronavirus result from a high-precision molecular test, known as a PCR test."The government has decided that the time has come to restore full air links with the outside world," Transport Minister Carlos Santos said during a press conference on Friday.Cruise ships and commercial vessels will also be able to dock in Cape Verde from Monday, he added.Sunseekers have traditionally flocked to the 10-island archipelago, where tourism represents about a quarter of its GDP.The former Portuguese colony's high season falls over the winter months.The government banned commercial flights after the outbreak of the pandemic, but initial plans to lift the restrictions in July were delayed.Health officials in Cape Verde have since recorded some 6,700 coronavirus cases to date, including 71 fatalities.Transport Minister Santos said the country had strengthened its testing capabilities ahead of its reopening, including establishing testing centres on the islands of Sal and Boa Vista â both tourist draws.Twenty-five provinces in China revealed its tourism revenue over the eight-day National Day holiday, 15 of which exceeded 10 billion yuan according to officials.

newspaper, the 11 countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than three months also being eligible.Eligible travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 before entering Japan and upon arrival in Japan, while their sponsors, such as companies or organizations which support them, will be expected to ensure their self-isolation for 14 days, during which time they will not be allowed to use public transport.The government had said it would consider permitting 1,000 foreigners into the country per day, mainly to accommodate those who intend to stay for three months or longer, while looking to increasing the cap in the months ahead.Foreigners with resident status here who had been overseas have recently been allowed to re-enter the county, while expatriates and other long-term residents from some Asian countries have also been granted access into the country.These include those from Vietnam, Thailand and a number of other economies with which reciprocal agreements have been made.The Japanese government has more recently made similar reciprocal agreements with Singapore and Brunei.Currently, people from 159 countries and regions have been denied entry to the country, but Japan has steadily been easing its entry restrictions. (Cover: Japan. /CFP) Japan is reportedly planning to ease travel restrictions to China and

that's all over after British Airways retired the fleet.It's easy to blame this on the COVID-19 pandemic, but truth be told, the 747 has had its day. Four fuel-guzzling engines have been replaced by two, and modern technology has left this massive people-carrier behind.But as with so many things in this pandemic, the inevitable has been accelerated â and this is still an industry gasping for survival.  On Wednesday evening, the UK's transport secretary, Grant Shapps, took to social media to reassure the aviation sector that it hadn't been forgotten.He tweeted: "We are moving ahead with the next step to reduce the travel quarantine period by launching the Global Travel Taskforce to open up international travel and boost our businesses."The task force will implement a testing regime to reduce the self-isolation period, along with a wide range of other measures to enable travel while keeping down infection rates.What everyone wants to see is quicker testing at the airports. So passengers can quickly verify their state of health and therefore avoid the exhaustive quarantine measures that have prevented passengers from bothering traveling.Currently under limited trial in Asia are digital health passports. A record for passengers who have taken a test within 72 hours to ensure a safe passage through international security.  The trial moves to the UK and Europe next week.The government's COVID-19 "safe list" of countries grows shorter by the day and gradually across the globe moments of access are being closed off again as much of the world braces itself for the second wave most knew would come but somehow hoped to avoid.Low-cost airline easyJet is now forecasting more than $1 billion in losses this year, confounding even pessimistic analysts' predictions.So far, the company has borrowed in the region of $800 million from the government, sold off aircraft and cut 4,500 jobs.Still it's calling for more action from the government.The airline says it will fly just 25 percent of its planned capacity for the rest of this year, behind rival Ryanair, which is aiming for 40 percent in October. The lumbering bulk of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet accelerating through the rain at London's Heathrow Airport has been a familiar sight since 1971 â but that's all over after British Airways retired the fleet.It's easy to blame this on the COVID-19 pandemic, but truth be told, the 747 has had its day.

She was told by her teacher of a special opportunity to work with helicopters. The project was recruiting students from poor families in Tibet, and she was lucky to be selected as one of them."At the beginning, I was excited and I couldn't believe it," she said.From February 2017, she started her training and learned to operate and maintain helicopters in Jiangsu.

It took only 3 years to build, and first went into operation 6 years ago.Chen Xin felt curious and excited when he first boarded a bullet train 6 years ago. He still remembers the day he got into a bullet train cab for the first time. He wasn't allowed to touch the control desk because his teacher was afraid that he might do something wrong and force the train to stop. Now he's become one of the best bullet train drivers in Xinjiang.Before 2011, Chen drove either diesel or electric locomotives. But he says driving bullet trains is very different, and much better."Diesel and electric locomotives don't seal properly. Sand still gets inside, even when the windows are closed," Chen said. He had to clean up the sand or it could have damaged the control desk and other devices in the cabin."Now bullet trains are wind and sand proof. So I can focus on my work, safely taking passengers to their destinations," he added.Xinjiang's first high-speed rail line officially opened in November 2014, connecting the region's capital city Urumqi with Hami, a city in east Xinjiang. The 530-kilometer trip used to take 4-6 hours. Today, it takes only 2.5 hours. Traveling by bullet train has now become a new way of life for the locals.Despite the transformation that high-speed railway has brought to the city, for Chen, one thing hasn't changed. That is the sense of responsibility."No matter what kind of locomotives you're driving, you should stick to your sense of responsibility. You should be responsible for yourself, your passengers, as well as the state property," he told CGTN.Chen has witnessed the railway's development in Xinjiang, from diesel locomotives to electric, and now bullet trains. What impressed him the most are the greater levels of efficiency as well as the working environment.The speed limit for trains in Xinjiang is now two times higher than before and Chen believes it'll be three times faster in the foreseeable future.The bullet train is changing people's way of life in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and boosting the region's economic potential.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

They were already down about 80 percent this year, due to the impact of the pandemic on the entertainment industry.  The company reopened its UK cinemas in July but customers numbers have been small since then.Cineworld's CEO, Moody Greidinger, said it was "not a decision we made lightly.""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings," he added. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time."Greidinger's statement also highlighted the challenges the firm faced in getting studios to release new movies.  Cineworld was hoping the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, could help turn around its fortunes. But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added. The world's second largest cinema chain, Cineworld, is temporarily shutting its theaters in the U.S. and the UK.The move is due to low footfall as a result of COVID-19 and puts 45,000 jobs at risk, including 5,500 in the UK.Cineworld's shares in London plunged more than 50 percent at one stage on Monday.

But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added.Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region received over 1.14 million visits during the first four days of the National Day holiday, an increase of more than 10 percent year on year, according to the local tourism department.  The iconic Potala Palace in Lhasa is full of festive atmosphere during the holiday. The palace has set a maximum capacity of 5,000 visitors per day due to coronavirus control and prevention measures.  This year, the Potala Palace allowed visitors to book via WeChat. Tourists can follow the official WeChat account palace and book tickets one day in advance.  With this year's National Day holiday having been extended to eight days, from October 1 to 8, as it coincides with the Mid-Autumn Festival, people across the country are taking advantage of the longer than usual holiday to travel.China has seen over 10 million daily railway trips for five consecutive days since the start of the National Day holiday. It is estimated that about 11.6 million railway trips were made across the nation on October 5, according to China State Railway Group.  The railway departments have added 564 passenger trains and implemented various service measures to ensure the smooth travel of passengers. Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region received over 1.14 million visits during the first four days of the National Day holiday, an increase of more than 10 percent year on year, according to the local tourism department.  The iconic Potala Palace in Lhasa is full of festive atmosphere during the holiday.

He's been in this occupation for seven years so far, the period of which, nonetheless, is just a fraction of that of his father and grandfather.The apple doesn't fall far from the treeThe story began in 1958 when his grandfather Li Wangfu, a native of east China's Shandong, went from Dandong Railway Bureau to Xining on a job transfer. "I arrived here on August 15, 1958," Li Wangfu told CGTN. In his 80s, he still remembers the date clearly. After a long bumpy ride, what appeared before his eyes was a barren land where the sun blazed down straight.When the Xining railway depot was set up in October 1959, Li Wangfu became one of the few train inspectors on the sparsely populated plateau. Back then, he hunted troubles and made overhauls with a slew of clumsy tools in the daytime and lived in a cellar, which he and his colleagues dug by themselves, on a dust hill just south to the garage of the station, at night."At that time, we went to wherever they needed us," he said. Every day he went off work with his coats soaked in black engine oil. Hard work paid off. He became one of the first train inspection chiefs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1984 â the year when the railroad linking Xining and Golmud, respectively the first and second largest city of Qinghai Province, started operation.Like father, like son. Li Xiujin's foray into train maintenance was hugely impacted by his father Li Wangfu. "My father once took me on his train, I felt it was really a good job," he recalled. In 1983, he was assigned to the Golmud Depot. "Back then, it took us over two days to travel from Xining to Golmud, where sands and pebbles were flying around."Li Xiujin and his colleagues lived in a small, drafty mud hut and carried repair hammers along with them to work every day. Over the past 37 years, he witnessed the booming development of railway technologies, which has largely facilitated train inspection.The Qinghai railway system introduced an array of automatic detecting machines in 2012, amid a nationwide tech-driven development momentum. Li Xiujin learned state-of-the-art technology and became a TFDS (Train of Freight Failures Detection System) centralized analyst. "Now I can check around 300 trains every day on computer."Repair and maintenance work used to rely more on experience but now "comprehensive skills" based on technical know-how are also required to guarantee the safety of passengers, according to third-generation Li Haifeng.From steam locomotives to electric trainsIn the 1950s and 1960s, what the train offered was a bottom-rattling, days-long ride â that was the era when steam reigned railroads. Steam locomotives helped thrust the world into the first industrial revolution and have since forged ahead the human civilization for the next 150 years.In China, the production and use of steam locomotives continued into the late 1980s though most of them were phased out at a much earlier time. In the 1960s, steam trains led the development of the country's railroad networks, driving its socio-economic development.Li Wangfu witnessed the antiques being gradually sifted out and the debut of internal combustion trains and then electric trains. "We're all electrified now."Over the past decades, China's train technology is all but obsolete. His son and grandson saw more unfathomable developments. "Previously on the Xining-Golmud section, the train ran at merely some 50 kilometers per hour, but now it could reach 160 kilometers," noted Li Haifeng.Now China has the world's biggest high-speed railway network, along with advanced inspecting methods for the facilities and equipment on the train."We have switched from heavy manual labor to mental work, just like a physician in a hospital," said Li Xiujin, "We just sit indoors, watch pictures taken by high-speed cameras, and report problems to on-site inspectors with the help of TFDS."For Li Haifeng, the work is much less laborious but requires more expertise. The train he works on has a UV filter inbuilt in its window, oxygen generators, and automatic excrement processing devices amid a variety of new facilities."Working on the train is tough, as you need to take into account the safety of every passenger. It's like being a 'doctor' who knows everything about the train and gives the right prescription," Li Haifeng said.Video director: Yu YingtianCameraman: Guo YuanhengText by Wang XiaonanCopy editor: Oscar MargainVoiceover: Sim Sim WissgottProduction assistant: Yu WenwenProducer: Zhang XiaoheSupervisor: Zhang Shilei"I'm continuing the dream of my father and grandfather," said Li Haifeng, a train inspector at the Xining Depot â the place where the trains on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway blew their first whistle.Thirty-one-year-old Li has been investigating and troubleshooting undetected faults in the facilities of each coach to ensure the safety of every train journey.

With the help of the government, they have moved out from the deep mountains and started a new life in well-constructed communities.Walking into the kitchen of a Dulong family, we found modern electrical appliances, a traditional fire pit and, surprisingly, a black piglet sleeping very well beside the warm fire. Unlike dogs or cats which are kept for pets, the pig is one of their livestock. Living with animals is common among some ethnic groups who living in remote areas. The fire pit sits on a three-legged iron frame. As it is used for warming the house and cooking, the fire pit is at the center of family life for humans and animals alike. When the piglet grows up, it will be sent to the pigsty. For now, it just enjoys the best time of its life inside the house.About "Go!

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

It is the first long holiday over three days since the coronavirus epidemic broke out in January.The tourism industry suffered a heavy blow during the epidemic. With the epidemic largely under control in the country, people are pinning high hopes on the holiday for a tourism boost. Preferential price stimulates tourism boomOne month before the holiday, travel agencies introduced various discounts and subsidies to attract tourists.China's top online travel platform Ctrip rolled out 1 billion yuan of subsidies for the National Day holiday on September 7, while its contender Fliggy backed by Alibaba announced a 10-billion-yuan-subsidy plan one day after. These can be used to book train tickets, hotels and scenic spot tickets.For example, if the subsidies are properly used, the ticket price for Shanghai Disney Resort can reach as low as 199 yuan compared to its normal price of 500 to 700 yuan, and the ticket price for some popular destinations, such as Beijing's Palace Museum and Guangzhou Chimelong Tourist Resort, can be halved.Scenic spots themselves have also striven to attract more visitors, with more than 500 across China exempting or reducing ticket prices.

People across the country reunite with family and friends, and enjoy the charm of moon together. Some people will choose to watch Peking Opera during the festivities, classic opera "Drunken Concubine" is one of the most widely circulated ones. It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera. "Drunken Concubine" has been performed in many countries including Russia, Austria and North Korea.Mid-Autumn Festival meets Peking OperaYu Kuizhi and Li Shengsu are two Peking Opera masters of the China National Peking Opera Company. Li Shengsu plays Yang, the main character in the opera "Drunken Concubine," which is basically a one-person show. Before Yu and Li, there was another notable Peking Opera artist: Mei Lanfang, who adapted "Drunken Concubine" to a new version. Mei took the traditional Chinese art abroad in the early 20th century, impressing foreign audiences with his beautiful voice and unforgettable performances. "Peking Opera needs to be passed down from one generation to the next, and our cultural exchanges with other countries also needed to be passed down like this," Yu told CGTN. Traditional festivals give people a chance to know more about time-honored culture like the Peking Opera, and also allows people to enjoy the country's national treasures. (Cover image designed bu Xu Qianyun)The Mid-Autumn Festival falls on October 1 this year, marking one of the most important and poetic Chinese festivals.

But now I just put on [my] headphones to get my GPS. "They [the policemen] can have a part of humanity and say to themselves 'I'm not going to fine a young person $158 who only earns the minimum wage.' But they don't have any humanity in fact, and then they complain about their reputation."Cyclists must now hope they steer clear of heavy traffic and the watchful eyes of the police. Police in Paris are issuing hefty fines to cyclists for committing traffic offences, following a huge rise in the number of people cycling around the city.Parisiens are continuing to avoid public transport as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with thousands of people using bikes as an alternative to travel to and from work.The huge increase in cyclists has resulted in several accidents, prompting police to monitor traffic in the city center and issue fines to those breaking the rules.  Commander Gilles Gravet, the head of the traffic police, said: "The behaviors that we notice most often, of course, are earphones in the ears or big helmets to listen, that's completely forbidden, it's a $158 fine, but also red lights, stop signs, road signs quite simply, it's generally a $158 fine."Police have specifically targeted a busy crossroads, which has been the scene of several serious incidents and where cyclists have been accused of ignoring red lights."We notice that here there are a lot of cyclists who run the red light, they all pass it, practically they don't stop despite our presence, because we are visible at the crossroads, we can't be missed, but they pass the red light," said a police officer called Jonathan."As a result, we give a fine because it's a rather accident-prone crossroads, we've already seen accidents here before, so we don't go through the traffic lights," he added.CLICK: SCIENTISTS LAUNCH 'EMERGENCY' PROJECT TO REVIVE UNDERSEA MEADOWS But cyclists have hit back at police, accusing them of issuing fines for minor offences and failing to show any empathy towards people who are being forced to cycle to save money.Anouck Linquier, a project manager living in the city, said: "If I get a fine for running a red light, I have nothing to say, I ran a red light.

The themed flower parterre along Chang'an Avenue has also been in place to welcome the upcoming National Day.  The themed flowerbeds along Chang'an Avenue were created with over 200 flower varieties and depict themes including "all-around well-off society" and "hard-won battle against the epidemic," highlighting the historical achievements in the course of the country's development.  In Harbin City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, a symphony concert titled "Me and My Motherland" was held Wednesday.  The residents in Yuncheng City, north China's Shanxi Province, also expressed their love for the motherland through music by organizing a community variety show with various song and dance performances.    Reuniting with friends and loved ones is customary during the festive celebrations. In Gongliu County of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, neighbors and friends from near and far gathered to make and enjoy local delicacies like Dapanji, or big plate chicken stew, and moon cakes.  "We put pomegranate seeds on moon cakes, signifying that people of all ethnic groups remain closely united like the seeds of a pomegranate that stick together, and we all live a prosperous life," resident Guzinay told CGTN.  The attractions and featured streets in many places were lit up with dazzling lights, forming gorgeous night scenes.  At the Yellow River Tower in Lanzhou City, northwest China's Gansu Province, a 3D projection light show was held with dazzling lights illuminating the mother river and the night sky.  In Nanjing City, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, the nighttime economy injects vitality into Changjiang Road, a popular scenic spot with 1,800 years of history.  Tourists can visit the night market, taste delicious food and watch a show at the theater.    "I think it's good to bring my kid here to experience the culture and distinctive atmosphere of Nanjing," said resident Zhang Xiao.  In Hezhou City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 2,300 drones changed formations in the night sky from time to time, forming patterns like the Chinese national flag and Tiananmen Rostrum, bringing viewers a visual feast.  In Shangqiu City, central China's Henan Province, a marvelous molten iron-splashing show awed spectators.  Listed as a national intangible cultural heritage item, the molten iron-splashing performance features one blacksmith throwing a ladle of molten iron up to the sky and another blacksmith beating the molten iron with a wooden club, creating a fascinating firework-like display to usher in the new year and extend wishes for good harvests. The activity can be traced back more than 1,000 years ago.In Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the ancient city wall was lit in red, and the words "Celebrate National Day" and "I love you, motherland" were projected on its surface. A huge five-star red flag was also passed through the crowd, expressing people's affectionate blessings to the motherland. (Cover image: People celebrate the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. /CFP)As the country's National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival both fall on October 1 this year, Chinese cities are festooned with flowers and lanterns and holding colorful activities to celebrate the joyful occasion.  At the center of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, one of China's most iconic landmarks, a giant flower and fruit basket was readied on September 24.

It provides help to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in the area, such as English lessons and financial budgeting.She thinks the UK should be doing more to provide safe and legal routes for asylum and said "shutting the door in people's faces isn't going to make this issue go away."Chapman added: "In the grand scheme of displaced people in the world, it's a relatively small number and the UK really does need to do its bit. France takes four times as many asylum applications as we do. Germany takes 10 times as many."But not everyone thinks Britain should be as welcoming, particularly in the middle of a global COVID-19 pandemic that has curtailed travel for millions of people worldwide. On the streets of Dover, there appeared to be support for tougher immigration policies."They all come over here. They could be murderers, terrorists and no one's stopping them. They're pretending to be children and they're like 30 years old," said Leigh, a local resident."It's about time somebody put a stop to it, isn't it?" said Janet, another Dover resident. "I mean, we haven't got any schools, we've got no hospitals, we've got nothing. So how can we bring all these extra people in?" she added.Daniel, 32, said the arrivals had transformed the area: "The population has gone from a normal, British civilization to â¦ half of us aren't even British. Come on, we're not being funny, who's pure British these days?"The sentiments highlight the concern and anger felt by some parts of the UK's population about a perceived lack of control of its borders.The issue of immigration was a key part of the Brexit debate, which culminated in Britain's departure from the European Union. Soon, that will mean an end to the free movement of people to and from the EU. But for many migrants, their journey to the UK is often long and perilous."They come from places where there are problems: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Sudan are common countries, also Syria, of course," said Chapman, back at the refugee center.Britain's government wants to make it easier to return potential asylum seekers who arrive from France and said smuggling gangs are profiting from the latest surge.Figures at the end of September suggest around 7,000 had made the journey, more than three times as many as in the whole of 2019.The latest increase in arrivals looks unlikely to stop any time soon. It's a journey that could mean life or death â but for the thousands attempting it, reaching the UK is worth risking the ultimate price.September has been the busiest month on record for migrants attempting to cross the English Channel.Around 2,000 people have been picked up by the UK's Border Force this month, many on small boats or dinghies, which are often unsafe.The UK recently beefed up patrols in the world's busiest shipping lane to dissuade people from embarking on the journey, often from France.The issue is being particularly felt in places such as Dover, a picturesque town in southern England where many migrants first arrive.  Bridget Chapman works with the nearby Kent Refugee Action Network.

Well, we've seen it now and it is, quite honestly, awesome."The jet pack can reach a top speed of around 56 kilometers per hour and climb to a maximum altitude of around 3,660 meters. A test simulation involved a 10-year-old girl who had fallen down cliffs and sustained a serious leg injury. CLICK: READ OUR GUIDE ON THE THREE MAIN COVID-19 TESTS BEING USED IN EUROPE The creator of the jet suit, Richard Browning, was able to obtain coordinates and then fly to the scene in just 10 minutes. The same journey would have taken responders 25 minutes on foot.According to the Lake District Search and Mountain Rescue Association, the number of incidents requiring emergency responses in 2019 was 584.Richard Browning, says he's excited by the potential of his creation for emergency services."It was wonderful to be invited to explore the capabilities of the Gravity JetSuit in an emergency response simulation and work alongside the team at GNAAS.

However, it is hard to spot Victorine Obola's small photo studio, despite it being one of the busiest places inDunga. People from all over Kisumu county flock here to capture their memorable moments on the shores of the largest freshwater lake in Africa.Some are photographed while on the beach while others prefer to have their photos deep into the waters while boat riding. Weekends ushers in a beehive of activities for friends and families who want to experience the cool breeze here, eat fish, or just while away time.This is where Miss Obola plies her trade and this has turned her into the most sought-after photographer on the beach. This is manifested in the long ques of people lining up waiting for their photographs to be processed in her studio.She juggles between her interests in photography and the highly competitive but male-dominated profession of being a coxswain."What happened is that while doing door-to-door photography in the market, I saw a school bus by the roadside,â she says. "I went near it and talked to the driver and requested them if the teacher would want some photos to be taken because it seemed they had come for a tour. So they accepted. They told me they were looking for a photographer but they did not know where to get one. So I got onto the bus, we went to Kisumu Airport, then Kisumu Lakeport took them some photos, then they came to Dunga beach for boat riding,âShe was also fortunate to be admitted by the Dunga Beach Management, to practice her trade here. She however did not know that she would end up also doubling as a coxswain.Initially, she had been working in a photography studio owned that time by a member of parliament in Kisumu city."I had a passion for photography. I decided to go to my member of Parliament who employed me in his studio. I worked there for one year.â"After that I decided to buy a small camera, using my savings. It cost around Ksh.8000/$80.The first day I went to Kibuye, the jua kali sector, I talked to a few people. Luckily the first day I got Ksh.350/$3.I also took photos of my neighbors.âAfter getting a permit to work as a photographer at the beach, she also saw another opportunity. An opportunity to learn boat-riding skills and earn an extra coin."Since I had a passion in physics and there are some topics that we were taught in high-school concerning navigation, navigating a ship, I just had the interest and so I talked to some coxswains around to see if they could train me and they accepted.âBut what happens in case there are clients who need their moments at the beach captured on camera and those who need to be boat ridden in the Victorian waters?"There are so many male coxswains around, but in case I get a customer who wants boat riding, I talk to my fellow photographers to help me as I do the boat riding, âShe says.Her job requires an agile person and who is hawk-eyed to be able to spot clients streaming into the beach. But not just that, one needs to be patient and persuasive to convince them to be photographed and part with some cash rather than using their own phones to do it."The major obstacle is this era of digital. Personally, I trained using a manual camera, but people come with their phones. You just have to explain and tell them why you want them to use your camera," Obola submits.Additionally, she says, with regards to being a coxswain, there are customers who do not have confidence in a woman. But some only want to be taken to the lake by a lady, and if it's not her turn because they ride these boats in turns, they refuse to go with male coxswain.Obola however says she faces those challenges in stride knowing that her two jobs help her put food on the table as well as educate her siblings."I come from a family of nine. I am the 6th born and I am the breadwinner because I have been able to educate my three siblings in high school and university level using the same photography and boat riding work.âIt has been four years of photography and boat-riding at Lake Victoria. But for the 36-year-old Obola, expanding her territory is her biggest dream now.The Kenyan government has established a marine school at the Port of Kisumu and Miss Obola wants to take advantage of the institution to hone her boat-riding skills and become a certified coxswain soon."If the light of God illuminates my life one day one time, I get a speed boat, after having gotten the certificate to do my own, have my own boat because these ones are not mine.â"And as for my photography, my ambition is to have a big studio right in the town center with big digital machines plus the latest machines for lamination in bulk so that customers will be coming to do their photo-shoot and get what they want," she concludes.As we finish our interview with her, she smiles at the next clients who want to be photographed. She quickly bids us goodbye and tells me that life is to be lived and to be enjoyed but the biggest step is to not fear anything.When one visits Kisumu city lying on the western parts of Kenya at the shores of Lake Victoria, one cannot miss an opportunity to sample some of its beautiful beaches among them, Dunga beach that is just an 8 kilometers drive from the city center.The beach is alive thanks to various activities going on.

Besides buying mooncakes, the occasion is also marked in artistic ways.Making Chinese tea is quite a complicated and demanding job. The tea leaves, the tools and every procedure counts. At the Dajue Temple in Beijing, a demonstration showcases how to make green tea properly."Chinese tea culture has a history of thousands of years," said Murong Zigui, director of the Minghui Teahouse. "Every year, we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Day at the Dajue Temple. We hope that people would always remember this quiet and happy moment in their life, drinking tea and watching Guqin performance at this ancient site."Such events featuring traditional Chinese culture are frequently held at the temple for the past 20 years. Tasting tea and playing Guqin, a seven-string musical instrument, was a way for friends to spend time together in ancient China.Guqin artist Yang Qing believes that the two art forms share something in common. "The taste of Chinese tea is considered to be mild, restrained and it has a lingering aftertaste. And the sound of Guqin is considered heavy and rich, inspiring positive sentiments from the bottom of one's heart. Both art forms give people a feeling of jade-like warmness and smoothness, and are deeply favored by Chinese people," he said.In distant Luxembourg, a similar celebration featuring Chinese tea culture has also been held. The relaxing occasion, as its Chinese organizers say, is supposed to allow people to release some stress during the pandemic."We organized Wenshi Tea ceremonies for French friends to introduce them this traditional way of drinking tea that originated from the Tang Dynasty. I feel that French people are really interested in that," said Duan Xiaoyang, president of the Sino-European Association for Art and Intercultural Communication.Various celebrations are taking place across China and abroad to celebrate this year's traditional Mid-Autumn Festival.

From September 28 to October 8, China's railways are expected to carry 108 million passengers, an average of 9.82 million per day.October 1 will be the peak, with an estimated 13 million passengers on the rails, the highest daily passenger flow since the outbreak of the pandemic, the group said.In order to meet the needs of tourists, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has lifted the upper limit for visitors at cultural and tourist locations from 50 percent to 75 percent of capacity.According to a notice released by the authority of Mount Huashan scenic area on September 28, the daily maximum passenger flow limit will be 20,000 and ticket sales will be stopped when the limit is reached.Meanwhile, starting from September 28, the maximum daily capacity for visitors to Mount Huangshan has been expanded from 25,000 to 37,500.From September 25, the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang City also raised the maximum daily limit of each ticket type to 75 percent of the normal capacity.Tickets to popular attractions are hard to getThe eight-day Golden Week has inspired people to travel. Some scenic attractions are already booked up, with popular spots such as the Palace Museum selling out from October 1 to 8.Tickets for the Jiuzhaigou Sparkling Lake in Sichuan Province from October 2 to 4 have also sold out.The ministry urged travelers to book tickets to scenic spots in advance.No booking, no travelShan Gangxin, deputy head of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism's resource development department, said that tourism sites should be opened and tickets booked in an orderly manner under the premise of overall prevention and control of the pandemic.The ministry also reminded tourists to understand and inquire in advance about epidemic prevention and control measures, opening hours, ticket reservations and passenger flow restrictions so as to ensure "no booking, no travel."For example, the Mount Huashan scenic area in northwest China's Shaanxi Province requires all tourists to register with the Shaanxi Health Code before booking tickets. Those with a green health code can book tickets, while those with a yellow or red code cannot.The Mount Huangshan scenic area in east China's Anhui Province also requires visitors to show a successful test or a matching ID card with health code and undertake a temperature test before entering the scenic area.Minimize 'unnecessary outbound travel'The Department of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded Chinese citizens to pay close attention to security alerts and overseas epidemic information issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassies and consulates. It also urged travelers to fully assess the serious risks of cross-infection and the long quarantine period brought by international travel and minimize "unnecessary travel."(Cover image from CFP)With Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day approaching, some popular scenic attractions in China, such as the Palace Museum, are already booked up for the holiday, while other attractions are selling out fast.

Read our guide to the most widely used including the Antibody, PCR and Antigen tests â explaining exactly what they do, how much they cost and how accurate they are.When the immune system is exposed to COVID-19, it produces IgG antibodies to fight the virus. A COVID-19 antibody test looks for IgG antibodies in a blood sample â if present, that means you have had the illness. Studies have shown antibodies are produced approximately 14 days after the start of the illness, so the best time to take the test is 14 to 21 days after feeling unwell.What does a positive result mean?A positive result means you have been exposed to the virus and your immune system has produced antibodies in response. A small number of people may have had the virus and produced antibodies without ever feeling unwell, meaning they are asymptomatic carriers. What does a negative result mean?A true negative result means the immune system hasn't produced antibodies because you haven't been exposed to the virus. However, a false negative is when you have been exposed to the virus but antibodies haven't been identified, either because the test was taken too soon or the body simply hasn't produced antibodies to fight the virus.Is the test accurate?The Roche antibody test widely used in the UK is 100 percent accurate in identifying IgG antibodies and 99.8 percent accurate in determining that there are no antibodies in the bloodstream. However, the timings of the test (pictured above) mean false negatives can occur, so it's imperative the test is taken within the 14-to-21-day window for optimal accuracy.How much does it cost?In the UK, only certain people who work in social care in England and Wales are able to get an antibody test for free. Otherwise, they must be bought at private clinics, with prices starting at $84. In Germany, the same test costs $76.How long will it take to get my results?Results typically take up to 72 hours from private health services. The PCR test is used to detect whether the COVID-19 virus is currently present in your body. This is done by looking for evidence of the virus's genetic material, known as RNA, from a swab sample taken from the nose and back of the throat. In the lab, a reagent is added to the sample â if the RNA is present the reagent sparks a chain reaction so it is visible to scientists, who can then correctly identify a positive test. The test is also commonly referred to as an RNA, genetic, molecular, viral detection or swab test.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?PCR tests vary in accuracy. Some can be as low as 70 percent accurate, as outlined here by Oxford University Hospitals in the UK. However, FIND (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics), tested five COVID-19 RT-PCR tests and found that all five achieved 100 percent specitivity on positive samples, and at least 96 percent specificity on negative samples.How much does it cost?Most European countries have made PCR tests available for free, though foreign nationals entering many EU countries have to pay. Travelers landing at Germany's Munich airport are being charged $213 for a PCR test.How long will it take to get my results?Between 12 and 24 hours but new technology available in some hospitals and medical practices can return results within just four hours. Similar to PCR tests, antigen tests also attempt to find out if you currently have the virus, but the process is slightly different. Rather than looking for the virus's genetic material, an antigen test looks for the presence of proteins or glycans, such as the spike proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus, via a swab sample taken from the nose and mouth.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?Antigen tests are typically very fast and cheap in many countries but are not as accurate as PCR tests, with some experts claiming they could miss 15-20 percent of infections when only small amounts of proteins or glycans are present. How much does it cost?Private UK test centers charge up to $173, while in France, they are available in pharmacies for as little as $15.How long will it take to get my results?Antigen tests are the fastest of the COVID-19 tests, with some producing results in just a few minutes.A range of COVID-19 tests are being used across Europe.

Mgahinga is also home to the endangered mountain gorillas."Golden monkeys are special in that they have an outstanding color that is nearly to the gold color, they are unique in that you can only track them from the Virunga Massif,âJoyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide at Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) told Xinhua in a recent visit to the park. UWA is a state-owned conservation agency.High up the ridges of the volcanic Mount Muhabura, which is part of Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, the golden monkeys feed on largely bamboo shoots. They live in troops of about 100, led by an Alpha male, according to UWA.Uganda has one habituated troop of about 60 golden monkeys and another group of about 80 monkeys is also being habituated as the country builds new tourist attractions.Golden monkeys are endangered species. According to UWA, tourists who come to see the mountain gorillas, which are the country's main tourist attractions, can also track the golden monkeys.Before tracking the monkeys, at the park gate, standard operating procedures like hand sanitizing, face mask-wearing and social distancing are practiced in a bid to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19 to the monkeys.About 300 meters before reaching the golden monkeys, visitors are hand sanitized again and urged to keep their face masks on. Visitors are also not allowed to get less than 10 meters away from the animals.Tourism is one of Uganda's major foreign exchange earners, bringing in about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars annually, according to ministry of finance figures.Although the sector has been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, government is optimistic that it will pick up as the country continues to ease the lockdown restrictions.Abiaz Rwamwiri, director at Africa Wild Explorations, a tour agency told Xinhua in a recent interview that once the country's international airport opens up on Oct. 1, as planned by government, tourists may start flocking in.Rwamwiri said that there are some confirmed tours scheduled for next year.Tucked on the common border with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda's Mgahinga Gorilla National Park is host to the endangered golden monkeys, a new tourist attraction.Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, which is part of the Virunga Massif is where "gold meets silver,âa tourism marketing catchphrase meaning a place where the golden monkeys coexist with the mountain gorilla silverbacks.

The football-obsessed SEC begins its season with fans in stadiums. Several teams in other leagues have had to postpone games because of outbreaks among players and staff.Institutions across the nation saw spikes of thousands of cases days after opening their doors in the last month, driven by students socializing with little or no social distancing. School and community leaders have tried to rein in the virus by closing bars, suspending students, adding mask requirements, and toggling between in-person and online instruction as case numbers rise and fall. Tension over the outbreaks is starting to boil over in college towns. Faculty members from at least two universities have held no-confidence votes in recent weeks against their top leaders, in part over reopening decisions. Government leaders want the University of Wisconsin-Madison to send its students home. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, alarmed by what he sees as draconian rules on college campuses, said he is drawing up a "bill of rights" for college students. In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, this week blamed outbreaks at two colleges for a surge of virus cases that boosted the state's infection rate high enough to put it on the list of places whose residents are required to quarantine when traveling to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The University of Wisconsin-Madison had seen more than 2,800 confirmed cases in students as of Friday. The school shut down in-person instruction for two weeks, locked down two of its largest dorms, and imposed quarantines on more than a dozen sorority and fraternity houses. The school lifted the dorm lockdown just this week. Dane County Executive Joe Parisi has demanded the university send all its students home for the rest of the academic year. "(The virus) was under control until the university came back," Parisi said. Chancellor Rebecca Blank has fired back, saying tens of thousands of students with off-campus housing would still come to the city. She accused Parisi of failing to enforce capacity restrictions in bars and off-campus parties."You can't simply wish (students) away, nor should you," Blank said in a statement directed at Parisi. Amid the fighting, thousands of students around the country have been quarantined in dorm rooms. At Kansas State University, more than 2,200 students have been placed in quarantine or isolation since class began. Student Emily Howard was isolated in what students have dubbed "COVID jail" after she and her dorm roommate tested positive for the virus on September 4, just three weeks after arriving on campus. "Now you walk around campus (and) pretty much everyone says they've had it," Howard said. "Now we don't really care as much because we know we had the antibodies." Bryan Fisher, a UW-Madison freshman quarantined in the dorms, said students were allowed to leave only to get food from the dining hall, and they were given only 30 minutes to make each trip. He said he spent his time studying and watching movies. "We were pretty much stuck in here," Fisher said. "It's been pretty hard to meet new people. Everyone's expectations of college aren't what they were." The University of Connecticut on Friday placed a third dormitory under medical quarantine. More than 150 students have tested positive. The University of Missouri has had more than 1,500 confirmed cases among students since classes began. The school plans to limit the crowd at Saturday's home football opener against Alabama to no more than 11,700 fans, leaving the stands about 80 percent empty. Florida State on Friday decided to require that students test negative for the virus a week before a football game before being allowed to attend and must wear masks in the stands. Seminoles coach Mike Norvell tested positive for the virus last week. Despite the attempts at mitigation, student cases have sent local county infection numbers soaring. Schools' decisions to push on with the semester have frustrated some faculty and local community leaders. Faculty members at Appalachian State in August approved a no-confidence vote against Chancellor Sheri Everts over university finances, morale and reopening plans. Everts has said she has received support from the school's Board of Trustees. The University of Michigan faculty took a no-confidence vote against President Mark Schlissel earlier this month. Faculty felt Schlisselâs administration hasnât been transparent about reopening decisions and hasnât released any modeling gauging the health risks. Graduate students went on strike Sept. 8 to protest reopening. Schlissel has acknowledged that trust in his leadership had slipped, but the universityâs governing board expressed support him this week. "Colleges and universities are ... under immense pressure to remain open," said Chris Mariscano, director of the College Crisis Initiative, a research project at Davidson College tracking the effects of the virus on higher education. "When the president of the United States starts tweeting (about staying open), you understand just how much politics is playing a role here and institutional survival is playing a role here." University officials across the country say they hope to bolster testing and contact tracing as the semester continues. But Mariscano said universities should expect college students to act like college students. At Kansas State, Howard was not especially concerned about the virus and didn't mind the "COVID Jail," where students got free laundry service and their own bedrooms. "I personally am not too worried about it, and everyone I have talked to is not that worried about it," she said. "I think it is more like, you are going to get it. It's just a matter of when."(Cover image: Auburn students are scanned to check for a health screening questionnaire before entering the stadium for the start of an NCAA college football game between Auburn and Kentucky, September 26, 2020. /AP)Colleges across the U.S. are struggling to salvage the fall semester amid skyrocketing coronavirus cases, entire dorm complexes and frat houses under quarantine, and flaring tensions with local community leaders over the spread of the disease. Many major universities are determined to forge ahead despite warning signs, as evidenced by the expanding slate of college football games occurring Saturday.

"When the president of the United States starts tweeting (about staying open), you understand just how much politics is playing a role here and institutional survival is playing a role here." University officials across the country say they hope to bolster testing and contact tracing as the semester continues. But Mariscano said universities should expect college students to act like college students. At Kansas State, Howard was not especially concerned about the virus and didn't mind the "COVID Jail," where students got free laundry service and their own bedrooms. "I personally am not too worried about it, and everyone I have talked to is not that worried about it," she said. "I think it is more like, you are going to get it. It's just a matter of when."(Cover image: Auburn students are scanned to check for a health screening questionnaire before entering the stadium for the start of an NCAA college football game between Auburn and Kentucky, September 26, 2020. /AP)TOP HEADLINES- The World Health Organization has admitted Europe has "a lot of work to do" to slow the spread of the virus, calling the spikes across the continent "worrying." - More than 50,000 Spanish flags have been set up in a park in Madrid to pay homage to the victims of COVID-19.

Gatherings of 10 people or more will be banned between 11 p.m and 6 a.m, shops that sell food or drinks will have to close at 10 p.m and no food can be consumed at street markets. The Brussels region is experiencing one of the sharpest spikes in new infections in Belgium, averaging 323 new cases a day. BrusselsEuropean Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has become the latest top EU official to head into quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19.

He exited quarantine on Friday after two negative COVID-19 tests. But the incident forced him to postpone a crucial leaders summit by a week.    Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamOn Monday night, the Dutch government will announce new measures to limit the spread of the virus in the densest regions of the country. Amsterdam (194 cases/100,000 inhabitants) and The Hague (180/100,000) are now in the Top 10 of cities with the most infections in Europe (Paris, with 231 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, tops the list). On Sunday, 2,999 people tested positive for COVID-19, a new daily record.The number of foreigners visiting the Netherlands is 70 percent lower than last year. Major events that were set in the Netherlands, Such as the Formula One Grand Prix, the Eurovision Song Contest and the UEFA Euro 2020 football tournament, were all canceled. Instead of the 21 million expected visitors, only seven million showed up. Also, 40 percent fewer Dutch people are going on holiday in their own country. This brings tourism in the Netherlands back to the level of the 1990s. Rahul Pathak in MadridIt's being reported that the socialist government of Pedro Sanchez could force the Madrid regional government to implement stricter coronavirus measures.  Right now 45 neighbourhoods in and around Madrid are under some form of lockdown, but the national government wants that extended to the entire city, which has the worst infection rate in Europe.  So far the right wing coalition government of Isabel Ayuso is resisting any further restrictions prompting the central government to say that it is prepared to intervene if there is "an urgent need." Isobel Ewing in BudapestPrime Minister Viktor Orban has assured Hungarians that the country will procure a vaccine against the coronavirus and it will be made available to everyone who needs it.Speaking on commercial broadcaster TV2, Orban said: "Brussels estimates the vaccine will be ready by 2021, while the Americans expect it to be ready by the end of the year".He added: "We'll be free from this misery and we will endure it until then."Orban said the coronavirus pandemic is worsening in Hungary and the situation is difficult, with a lot of pressure on health and education both now and in the coming months. However, he believes that as the winter months approach, people will be more inclined to abide by hygiene rules.Andrew Wilson in LondonThe government is expected to enforce a total social lockdown on large parts of the country today, including London. Pubs and restaurants could be ordered to close for two weeks and households banned from meeting each other.As of today, people face a heavy fine if they do not self-isolate after a positive test or are told to quarantine by test-and-trace services. Household members should also self-isolate by law.The police are expected to start carrying out spot checks in areas where there are high levels of the virus.Thousands of university students remain in self-isolation in their halls of residence. Ministers say any complaints about fees should be directed at the institutions, not the government. Ross Cullen in ParisIn France, the latest measures came into force overnight on Sunday into Monday, including the closure of all bars and restaurants in Marseille, Aix-en-Provence and Guadeloupe. In Paris, sports centers and gyms have closed and bars in the capital now must close at 10 p.m. These measures will be in place for at least two weeks. The moves come as a new poll in the Journal de Dimanche Sunday newspaper shows that 72 percent of French citizens are in favor of new nationwide lockdown for at least 15 days. In the same survey, it showed that only 44 percent of those polled said they trusted the government to help businesses recover. On Monday, finance minister Bruno Le Maire will present the budget for next year. The 2021 finance bill sets out the main lines of the $116 billion stimulus plan and the government says its forecasts have anticipated a possible deterioration in economic health. FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: WHO backs China's emergency use of COVID-19 vaccinesCGTN America: Is New York dead?

Restaurants can also reopen for indoor dining at 25 percent capacity on Wednesday.The bubbles caught the eye of CafÃ© du Soleil owner Alain Chevreux in July when he was online, figuring out how to stay in business.At limited indoor capacity, Chevreux said the 20 seats would not be enough to pay his chef, cooks and other staff. And who would pay to eat in the cold, rain or snow without shelter?Fifteen bubbles saved Chevreux much toil and trouble. At 400 U.S. dollars a pop, the capsules hold six people, and customers ask to reserve them over the phone."Families love it. Kids love it. Friends who want to get together love it," Chevreux said.

Restaurants can also reopen for indoor dining at 25 percent capacity on Wednesday.The bubbles caught the eye of CafÃ© du Soleil owner Alain Chevreux in July when he was online, figuring out how to stay in business.At limited indoor capacity, Chevreux said the 20 seats would not be enough to pay his chef, cooks and other staff. And who would pay to eat in the cold, rain or snow without shelter?Fifteen bubbles saved Chevreux much toil and trouble. At 400 U.S. dollars a pop, the capsules hold six people, and customers ask to reserve them over the phone."Families love it. Kids love it. Friends who want to get together love it," Chevreux said. "It was raining a couple of weeks ago, midweek, pouring, raining. Everybody that was inside those bubbles were having a blast."Childhood fantasies awaken for some diners."As soon as I came in, I said, wait a minute, it looks like Cinderella's carriage," said Sylvia Gonzalez as she dined with her granddaughter and friend. "It's beautiful."Her friend Blanca Morales felt safe and optimistic inside the "carriage.""You're not being cluttered with other people, crowded, very, like, individual, you know?" she observed. "Like she said, I'm waiting for my prince to get here."(Cover: A woman sits outside CafÃ© du Soleil under a bubble tent following the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the Manhattan borough of New York City, New York, U.S., September 23, 2020. /Reuters)When the leaves start to turn gold in autumn, Ejin Banner, located in the westernmost part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in north China, is ready to welcome flocks of tourists from all over the country. As the eight-day National Day holiday fast approaches, the annual ecological tourism festival featuring Populus euphratica is scheduled to open in Ejin during the Golden Week.Populus euphratica, also known as desert poplar, is a rare species that can survive in extremely dry and cold regions, commonly found in temperate deserts in China's western part. Sitting in the Gobi Desert, Ejin is home to one of the largest Populus euphratica forests in the country â nearly 30,000 hectares.Over the years, by putting the rich resources of poplar desert forests into good use, Ejin has made various efforts in developing the tourism industry while preserving the rare species. The thriving tourism businesses have boosted the local economy and helped those once impoverished households escape extreme poverty.Ejin has built several tourist attractions, among which the Populus Euphratica Forest Tourist Area has now become one of the must-visit spots in autumn for outings and photographs and also a landmark in Ejin.The booming tourism sector has then tempted more local farmers and herdsmen to join the cooperative to run various tourism-related businesses, such as opening homestay inns, offering horse-riding, camel-riding, as well as off-riding vehicle rental services at the scenic spot.As of the end of 2019, 63 registered poor households (146 people) in Ejin were able to witness a surge in their earnings through working in the tourism industry. Statistics from the local government showed that their average annual income saw an increase of 13,637 yuan (2,000 U.S. dollars) per household compared with the previous year.Acknowledging the significant role that the ecological environment has played in Ejin's tourism development, local people started to make efforts in ecological construction and preservation. In 2018, China Green Foundation, a non-governmental organization, launched a "Euphrates poplar project" in Inner Mongolia in a bid to fight desertification. Also, in this June, the local government launched a set of regulations on protecting the desert poplar forests in Ejin.Read more: Inner Mongolia's rejuvenating desert poplar forestsLast year from January to November, Ejin received a total of 8 million domestic and foreign tourists, a year-on-year increase of 15 percent, with the overall tourism revenue exceeding 7.6 billion yuan (1.1 billion U.S. dollars), according to Du Zigang, deputy director of the local culture and tourism bureau.

Holding carnival - whether it's samba schools or 'blocos,' any kind of carnival with crowds of people - without certainty on a vaccine or guarantees for people's health is a mistake," said Rita Fernandes, president of the Sebastiana association."Sebastiana has decided that without a vaccine and especially without health guarantees for the population, we're not going to hold any kind of carnival at all," she told TV network Globo News.Rio's carnival, the world's biggest, draws millions of tourists from around Brazil and the world each year.But it has become the latest casualty of the pandemic, as Brazil struggles to get a handle on the second-deadliest outbreak of COVID-19 in the world, after the United States.Brazil has registered 4.7 million infections and nearly 140,000 deaths from the virus.And while its spread has slowed somewhat since July, the numbers are still alarmingly high, with an average of nearly 30,000 new cases and 735 new deaths per day over the past two weeks, according to health ministry figures.Rio is the Brazilian city hit second-hardest, after economic capital Sao Paulo, with 10,730 deaths.This is the first time it has postponed carnival since 1912.The pandemic had already forced Rio to scrap another tourist magnet, its annual New Year's Eve celebrations on Copacabana beach.The city's economy will likely take a hit from both decisions. Last year, carnival brought 1.5 million tourists to Rio and added 3.8 billion reais (685 million U.S. dollars) to the economy.But many residents said they supported the move."I'm a huge fan of carnival - I go to the 'blocos,' I dance in a samba school. But right now we need to be protecting people, especially the elderly," Carla Mauro, a 52-year-old architect, said on Copacabana."A year with no carnival won't kill anyone."(Cover: Queen of Percussion Raissa Machado of Unidos do Viradouro Samba School performs during the 2020 Rio de Janeiro Carnival champions' parade at the Sapucai Sambadrome on February 29, 2020 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. /CFP)Revelers hoping to escape the coronavirus doldrums at Rio de Janeiro's world-famous carnival got more bad news Friday as organizers indefinitely postponed the city's epic street parties, a day after the official parades were scrapped.Originally scheduled for February 2021, the Brazilian beach city's carnival is a massive mixture of social-distancing no-no's, from the huge crowds that attend the annual samba school parade competition to the giant free-for-all of street parties known as "blocos."After organizers announced Thursday they were indefinitely postponing the samba school parades because of the pandemic, the association responsible for 11 of the biggest "blocos" said it was following suit."The samba school league made the absolutely correct decision.

It drew travelers and traders from far and wide, all with different perspectives on life and eager to learn from others. It was known to be a place where a belief system could truly thrive.  The centuries seem to have passed by in a flash here. Yet, the long passage of time could not totally bury history.  There are ruins of Subash Temple north of the city of Kuqa in southern Xinjiang, highlighting the dominance of the Buddhist religion in these parts."Buddhism came to Qiuci around the 2nd century," illustrated Miao Lihui, chief researcher at Kucha Academy of Xinjiang. "Construction began on Subash in the following century. It was supposed to be the largest temple here. It flourished until the 12th century." "From here, we can see traces of the time when Indian Buddhism was introduced into China, and Chinese Buddhism later spread westward," Miao said. These traces have gone down in history and the evidence is still quite vague.  However, there are stronger claims in the Kizil Buddhist cave temples in neighboring Baicheng County. Miao Lihui has been doing research here for two decades. "The theme of these paintings is closely related to Sakyamuni, and so are the stories. The tales are about Buddha's previous lives and journey in this life. On this dome, there's a painting of the Buddha's life as Prince Sudana is sacrificing his own life to save a family of tigers," Miao explained as he showed us into a cave. These paintings are said to encourage kindness and good deeds. It was actually from Qiuci where Buddhism was introduced to central China.  Qiuci's prince Kumarajiva traveled eastward and translated numerous Buddhist scriptures into the ancient Chinese language in Chang'an, today's Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, until he passed away.  "We see these temples, grottoes and the Buddhists who once lived here and brought Buddhism to Qiuci. Through this, they were able to bridge cultural exchanges between the east and the west and promote world cultural prosperity and development," Miao said. Though in the past centuries, many were stolen and brought to other parts of the world, those that remain are well-preserved and listed as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. They are our window into a time when Buddhism truly flourished in Xinjiang. Over time, Buddhism gradually disappeared from Qiuci, now known as Kuqa. But its legacy remains. It will not quietly turn to ashes and dust, but rather be remembered for generations to come.  Kuqa, a bustling township at the center of the ancient state of Qiuci, used to be a hub for business, culture and thoughts along the ancient Silk Road.

Here is a breakdown of all the latest rules as of 0900 GMT on Thursday 24 September. UKFollowing a rise in infections, UK prime minister Boris Johnson announced new lockdown measures across England on Tuesday. Having originally been encouraged to return to offices, people are now being advised to work from home if possible. People are also banned from meeting in groups of more than six, indoors and outdoors â with weddings are now restricted to just 15 people and funerals capped at 30. Face masks must be worn on public transport and in supermarkets, shops and all indoor spaces, while shop staff must also wear masks at all times. Fines for not wearing a mask have also risen to $254 for a first time offence. Pubs, restaurants and bars must close by 22:00 and will operate with table service only. All travelers returning to the UK from abroad must observe a 14-day quarantine period except from countries where there is an established travel corridor. FrancePeople are being advised to work from home and avoid offices. On public transport, face masks must be worn at all times by passengers and staff and there is an on-the-spot $158 fine for non-compliance. In shops, masks are compulsory for all customers and staff, while in bars and restaurants masks must be worn by staff and by customers when they move around, for example going to the toilet. Different cities have different closing times, while some, like Marseille, Bordeaux, Lyon and Nice, do not allow gatherings of more than 10 people. At weddings and funerals everyone must wear a face mask and stay a meter away from other attendees. Outdoors, there is a limit of 10 for gatherings in some cities.There are no restrictions on entry back into France from other EU member nations plus 19 other countries (including Australia, Canada, Switzerland and the UK). Travelers returning from a country not in the EU or on the list of 19 other states must have a specific reason for traveling to France and will be subject to a two-week quarantine period if they show symptoms of COVID-19 on arrival or cannot present a negative PCR test, carried out less than 72 hours before departure.   SpainThe government is advising people to work from home, although for some low-paid people that is proving impossible. Face masks must be worn at all times on public transport and in shops, which also require people to wear gloves when handling food. In bars and restaurants, staff must wear masks at all times. Customers are exempt when eating and drinking but must wear one when they move around or go to the toilet. Wedding venues can only operate at 60 percent capacity. For funerals, 50 people are allowed to attend outdoors and 25 indoors. Social gatherings of more than 10 people are also banned but there is no current limit on indoor meetings, although more than 10 would be frowned upon. Spain allows all EU citizens to arrive without having to go into quarantine. Anyone coming into Spain must complete a special online health form: once they send it off, they will receive an email with a QR code that will allow access at the arrival airport in Spain.â¢ Arctic Circle: ice floes captured by drone after huge chunk breaks off â¢ How Europe's air pollution rose as COVID-19 lockdowns eased â¢ UK students show off their Mandarin in Chinese Bridge Competition  GermanyEmployees are continuing to work from home. It's compulsory for people to shield their mouth and nose with a cloth covering (scarves are acceptable) on public transport, in grocery stores and other shops.

There are no limitations on opening hours. People must keep a minimum of 1.5 meters (roughly five feet) away from those outside their household when out in public; when sitting in parks or other green spaces, they must maintain a five-meter distance. There is no longer any limit on the number of people who can meet from different households, indoors or outdoors. Germans are discouraged from undertaking unnecessary trips to all countries, except those who are low-risk. From 1 October, Germany will offer specific travel advice for travel to and from individual countries based on their infection rates.   ItalySmart working agreements (working from home) are being encouraged between employers and employees. Face masks must be worn from 18:00 to 06:00 local time in all public and outdoor spaces across Italy where social distancing isn't possible.

Designers from across the nation have brought their latest ideas to inspire Beijing visitors. Modern design ideas refresh various articles for everyday use, like furniture, costumes, and decorations. How to transmit the country's rich cultural heritage has been a subject much discussed among artists and craftsmen in recent years. Many believe merging ancient with modern in fashion for mass production is the best way. "The Chinese tiger pillow is a mascot inherited from ancient China. It has been considered a symbol of protection of its owner and was commonly used as pillows or sachets. Artist Sanmao uses it in jewelry making.

He said that police would be able to get military support if required, and warned that the new measures, which are intended to avoid a second full lockdown, could last for six months. The key measures include:* Pubs and restaurants to close by 10pm* Asking people to work from home if they can* The requirement to wear face masks is extended to shop workers and fines for non-compliance doubled to $256* Maximum number allowed at weddings cut to 15 people* Plans to allow some spectators into sports stadiums from 1 October have been paused - A European Union leaders' summit due to start on Thursday has been postponed after a security guard tested positive for coronavirus, forcing Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, to quarantine. - Spain's cumulative tally of confirmed coronavirus infections rose by nearly 10,800 on Tuesday from the previous day. Meanwhile, the region of Catalonia said it would further limit public gatherings as cases continue to rise.- The World Health Organization said 1,998,897 new COVID-19 cases were registered around the world last week - a six percent increase on a week earlier.

The League was returned to power in Veneto and Liguria. Italians also voted in a national referendum to reduce the number of members of parliament, which was a key pledge by coalition ally The Five Star Movement. In another win for the government, the result was overwhelmingly in favour. Numbers will be cut by a third, from 945 to 600.In case you missed it:Â·  China-EU relations: The Agenda in fullÂ·  Alexei Navalny able to walk and talk after comaÂ·  How our brains 'join the dots' while we are asleepStefan de Vries in AmsterdamThere were 2,223 new cases on Monday, a new record. The number of people with COVID-19 in hospitals almost doubled in one week: 410 on Monday, compared with 209 seven days ago. The number of people in intensive care rose from 77 to 85. The government has underestimated the number of people who wanted to get tested. "We should have made a better prediction," said one of the members of the Dutch COVID-19 Outbreak Management Team. To be able to meet the increase in demand, the Ministry of Health has struck deals with large German labs which can analyse the Dutch tests. In November, an estimated 55,000 test per day will be necessary, in February possibly 85,000 a day.A quarter of all workers with COVID-19 symptoms still show up at work, an investigation by Dutch public television revealed. Almost half of them fear consequences by their employer if they call in sick.  Mia Alberti in FrankfurtGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn is visiting the Frankfurt plant of the biopharmaceutical giant, Sanofi, one of the laboratories leading the race for a COVID-19 vaccine.Sanofi is set to be the main supplier of the vaccine when it is completed. The EU has signed an agreement with the French company for the supply of 300 million doses.In Germany, the government has been heavily supportive of vaccine development and research. On 15 September, it announced $881 million in funding for the three German companies working on possible vaccines: Biontech, Curevac and IDT Biologika.Minister Jens Spahn has warned "there won't be enough vaccine for everyoneâ¦ at the beginning," but "there will certainly be enough for everyone within months," he told public broadcast Deutschlandfunk on Monday.Toni Waterman in BrusselsThe Belgian government plans to ease up on travel bans in a bid to foster better coordination between EU member states. Come Friday, it will replace bans on travel to "red zones" with notices strictly advising against travel to these areas. Belgium has been the only European country to ban travel to red zones, allowing few exemptions to the rule and requiring a COVID-19 test and 14-days of quarantine upon return. The change comes as the number of cases in the country surges, averaging nearly 1,200 new infections a day. The government said teenagers make up the bulk of new cases. And with the reproduction rate at 1.3, the epidemic is still growing.  Ross Cullen in ParisThe city of Lyon has introduced stricter measures to try to control the surge in new coronavirus cases. The number of communities in the wider RhÃ´ne region where face masks are obligatory has been extended. There are new limits on care home visits: each resident can have only two visits a week. Mass gatherings have also been limited - down from a maximum number of attendees of 5,000 to 1,000 people. Also coming into force on Tuesday are the new infection and isolation measures for schools, which will see classes only all being sent home if there are three positive cases in one class (from three different households). And Italy is tightening its rules for travellers coming in from France by making arrivals from seven regions, including Paris, undergo compulsory COVID-19 tests. Nawied Jabarkhyl in LondonPrime Minister Boris Johnson is set to address the nation on Tuesday evening after a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.

The key measures include:* Pubs and restaurants to close by 10pm* Asking people to work from home if they can* The requirement to wear face masks is extended to shop workers and fines for non-compliance doubled to $256* Maximum number allowed at weddings cut to 15 people* Plans to allow some spectators into sports stadiums from 1 October have been paused - A European Union leaders' summit due to start on Thursday has been postponed after a security guard tested positive for coronavirus, forcing Charles Michel, the president of the European Council, to quarantine. - Spain's cumulative tally of confirmed coronavirus infections rose by nearly 10,800 on Tuesday from the previous day. Meanwhile, the region of Catalonia said it would further limit public gatherings as cases continue to rise.- The World Health Organization said 1,998,897 new COVID-19 cases were registered around the world last week - a six percent increase on a week earlier. It was "the highest number of reported cases in a single week since the beginning of the epidemic," the agency said.- Czechia Prime Minister Andrej Babis has admitted that the government made a mistake when it eased the COVID-19 restrictions over the summer, adding that he does not want to make the same mistake again. - Holiday company TUI has announced it will operate at a reduced capacity over the winter because of the ever-changing travel restrictions.- Spain's health ministry has admitted "the option is there" to impose a broader lockdown in the country's capital, Madrid, if cases continue to surge in the city.- German airline Lufthansa announced further cuts to its fleet and workforce and said it expects to operate at between 20 and 30 percent of capacity in the fourth quarter. "The outlook for international air traffic has significantly worsened in recent weeks," the company said in a statement.- The European Medicines Agency, the regulator which authorise medicines before they can be used in the European Union, has this month been in contact with 38 makers of potential COVID-19 vaccines, it has said. - Czechia's prime minister Andrej Babis has nominated epidemiologist Roman Prymula, who helped with the country's initial response to the pandemic, as the country's new health minister after the previous minister, Adam Vojtech, submitted his resignation on Monday following criticism over his handling of the pandemic.- More than 200 asylum-seekers admitted to a new refugee camp in the Greek island of Lesbos have tested positive for COVID-19, according to a government spokesman.- Masks will be made mandatory in some areas of the German city of Munich after a surge in new infections.- Italy has announced anyone arriving from some areas of France will have to take a mandatory test following rising cases across the nation.- Russia's new infections rose by 6,215 in the past 24 hours, its highest daily new cases since 18 July, bringing the cumulative total to 1,115,810.

The League was returned to power in Veneto and Liguria. Italians also voted in a national referendum to reduce the number of members of parliament, which was a key pledge by coalition ally The Five Star Movement. In another win for the government, the result was overwhelmingly in favour. Numbers will be cut by a third, from 945 to 600.In case you missed it:Â·  China-EU relations: The Agenda in fullÂ·  Alexei Navalny able to walk and talk after comaÂ·  How our brains 'join the dots' while we are asleepStefan de Vries in AmsterdamThere were 2,223 new cases on Monday, a new record. The number of people with COVID-19 in hospitals almost doubled in one week: 410 on Monday, compared with 209 seven days ago. The number of people in intensive care rose from 77 to 85. The government has underestimated the number of people who wanted to get tested. "We should have made a better prediction," said one of the members of the Dutch COVID-19 Outbreak Management Team. To be able to meet the increase in demand, the Ministry of Health has struck deals with large German labs which can analyse the Dutch tests. In November, an estimated 55,000 test per day will be necessary, in February possibly 85,000 a day.A quarter of all workers with COVID-19 symptoms still show up at work, an investigation by Dutch public television revealed. Almost half of them fear consequences by their employer if they call in sick.  Mia Alberti in FrankfurtGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn is visiting the Frankfurt plant of the biopharmaceutical giant, Sanofi, one of the laboratories leading the race for a COVID-19 vaccine.Sanofi is set to be the main supplier of the vaccine when it is completed. The EU has signed an agreement with the French company for the supply of 300 million doses.In Germany, the government has been heavily supportive of vaccine development and research. On 15 September, it announced $881 million in funding for the three German companies working on possible vaccines: Biontech, Curevac and IDT Biologika.Minister Jens Spahn has warned "there won't be enough vaccine for everyoneâ¦ at the beginning," but "there will certainly be enough for everyone within months," he told public broadcast Deutschlandfunk on Monday.Toni Waterman in BrusselsThe Belgian government plans to ease up on travel bans in a bid to foster better coordination between EU member states. Come Friday, it will replace bans on travel to "red zones" with notices strictly advising against travel to these areas. Belgium has been the only European country to ban travel to red zones, allowing few exemptions to the rule and requiring a COVID-19 test and 14-days of quarantine upon return. The change comes as the number of cases in the country surges, averaging nearly 1,200 new infections a day. The government said teenagers make up the bulk of new cases. And with the reproduction rate at 1.3, the epidemic is still growing.  Ross Cullen in ParisThe city of Lyon has introduced stricter measures to try to control the surge in new coronavirus cases. The number of communities in the wider RhÃ´ne region where face masks are obligatory has been extended. There are new limits on care home visits: each resident can have only two visits a week. Mass gatherings have also been limited - down from a maximum number of attendees of 5,000 to 1,000 people. Also coming into force on Tuesday are the new infection and isolation measures for schools, which will see classes only all being sent home if there are three positive cases in one class (from three different households). And Italy is tightening its rules for travellers coming in from France by making arrivals from seven regions, including Paris, undergo compulsory COVID-19 tests. Nawied Jabarkhyl in LondonPrime Minister Boris Johnson is set to address the nation on Tuesday evening after a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.

Due to the impact of COVID-19, tourists tend to choose shorter trips in order to spend less time travelling. The recommended routes are meant to tap into local cultural and agricultural resources and boost economic growth. Data by the ministry showed that rural tourism in the country experienced a strong recovery in the second quarter of this year, with the total revenue increasing by nearly 149 percent from 69.5 billion yuan (about 10.3 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, and continued to pick up steam. China celebrates its National Day on October 1 every year.

This number, he said, was 2.6 times higher than the one before the COVID-19 outbreak. These flights have been strengthening the bonds amid the pandemic, he added.The first direct international flight to land in Beijing following the lifting of COVID-19 curbs was that of Air China (CA746). Departing from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, the plane landed at the Beijing Capital International Airport on September 3, signifying the resumption of direct international flights.Resumption of flights in China offers a glimmer of hope for the aviation industry globally. However, travel norms for passengers, especially when it comes to air travel, have changed in ways that were previously unimaginable.New guidelines for air travel As the restrictions are eased, an increasing number of people are choosing air travel to commute domestically. Naturally, airports are not how they used to be.Passengers need to wear masks covering their nose and mouth, and there are signs reminding them to do so everywhere at the airports. Additionally, it is essential to practice social distancing, staying at least 6 feet apart, especially when waiting in line."Most viruses and germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes," according to travel guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Some airline companies have canceled their in-flight meals to decrease touch points onboard, while others are providing passengers with pre-packaged meals only. For example, Delta announced that "customers in all cabins will now receive their own personal snack bags on domestic flights," which include crackers and cookies. Body temperature checks are becoming part of the new airline boarding process, as a fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19, according to CDC and other medical institutions.  A health QR code or health declaration form has become a travel necessity in China after the coronavirus outbreak. Filling in the health code information before landing could save one more time. It's important to check the policies of the destination cities or countries for information, as some regions will require a nucleic acid test for COVID-19 before entry. The number of passengers globally will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024, according to International Air Transport Association. So, passengers now are adjusting to new guidelines for air travel. (Cover image designed by Feng Yuan)In the end of August, China was operating more than 13,000 flights per day, hitting about 90 percent of the pre-pandemic level, said Cui Xiaofeng, deputy director of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), on September 9. Speaking at the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), Cui said as many as 1,068 cargo flights operated between China and the countries and regions along the Belt and Road on a weekly basis.

Since the initial launch of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, this railway has become the most popular and convenient way to connect Tibet to the rest of China, bringing tremendous profits to the regions.Dubbed the "sky road" and noted as a man-made wonder in transportation, the 1,956-kilometer-long world-renowned railway begins in Xining and ends in Lhasa. The stunning scenery along the railway offers not only a feast for the eyes, but also a journey for the soul. Come join CGTN to enjoy the enchanting trip on the Qinghai-Tibet train! Qinghai Lake: A paradise for birdwatchers and cyclistsStarting from Xining Railway Station, it takes around one hour to appreciate the stunning view of Qinghai Lake. Dazzling like a crystal-clear gem, Qinghai Lake is the largest inland lake as well as saline lake in China. Surrounded by lofty mountains, the lake features two sub-lakes: a saline Gahai Lake and a freshwater Erhai Lake. Be it the blue sky and water, the green grassland or mesmerizing landscapes â Qinghai Lake boasts great charms worth exploring.Qinghai Lake is definitely a paradise for bird lovers as many different kinds of birds would fly here to breed in May and June due to the mild weather. Meanwhile, for cyclists, cycling around the lake not only allows them to enjoy the beauty of the lake view, but also while away the time.Tips: The best time to visit the Qinghai Lake is from April to August as numerous Cole flowers blossom along the lake during that time, forming breathtaking scenery for visitors. In addition, May and June are the best season for bird watching.Kunlun Mountains: More than just mountainsAs the train keeps moving up, a picturesque view of the Kunlun Mountains appears before you. Reputed as the holy mountains, the Kunlun extend west from the Pamirs with a length of 2,500 kilometers. The 6,178-meter-high Yuzhu Peak is the highest of the Kunlun Mountains in Qinghai. The high peaks are covered with snow and mist all year round, creating a stunning view along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It's worth mentioning that Yuzhu Peak is the first sightseeing station for passengers, which allows them to get off the train and take photos outside. It is considered to be an ideal choice for hiking beginners as its route requires less technique.Hoh Xil Nature Reserve: 'Forbidden zone for humans'Hoh Xil, which means "green mountains" in Mongolian, is a plateau between the Kunlun and Tanggula mountain ranges, with an average altitude of 5,000 meters. Home to many wild animals, including the Tibetan antelope and the wild yak, Hoh Xil Nature Reserve is undoubtedly a desolate region in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The extensive area of alpine mountains and steppe systems is situated more than 4,500 meters above sea level, where sub-zero average temperatures prevail all year round. The geographic and harsh climatic conditions have made this place a "forbidden zone for humans," which is also a reason for its biodiversity. This is probably one of the few places left on Earth where one could get off the beaten track and find inner peace.  Tips:  As there are no signs in Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, visitors often get lost here. Remember to bring a local guide with you or rent a car to travel. Tsonag Lake: A 'soul lake' for TibetansLying in Amdo County, Nagqu Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tsonag Lake is one of the most significant holy lakes to local residents.  The Qinghai-Tibet railway passes right by the lake, making it the closest altiplano lake to the railway on the road. Passengers can take photos and capture the charming view of the lake as they would definitely have something to brag about on social media.Lhasa: The start of the journey to TibetThe final destination of the Qinghai-Tibet train trip â Lhasa, offers almost every aspect of Tibetan culture. If one must pick a name card for Lhasa, the Potala Palace is very likely to be the answer. No one can really say that he/she has visited Lhasa unless they have been to the Potala Palace â a must-see for travelers from home and abroad. Tibet is always full of incredible scenery. In early March when most of the plateau is still tinged with a wintry chill, Nyingchi Prefecture, in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, is blanketed with pink blossoms. If you want to record all the scenery along the sky road, seeing them yourself is not enough. The feelings from the bottom of your heart are important. So, what are you still waiting for? It's time to pack your bag and start the soul journey to Tibet where you could completely hand over yourself to nature and experience the unique Tibetan culture.  For centuries, Tibet has not been explored as much by the outside world due to its remote location, extreme climate and geographic environment. Since the initial launch of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, this railway has become the most popular and convenient way to connect Tibet to the rest of China, bringing tremendous profits to the regions.Dubbed the "sky road" and noted as a man-made wonder in transportation, the 1,956-kilometer-long world-renowned railway begins in Xining and ends in Lhasa.

Meanwhile, for cyclists, cycling around the lake not only allows them to enjoy the beauty of the lake view, but also while away the time.Tips: The best time to visit the Qinghai Lake is from April to August as numerous Cole flowers blossom along the lake during that time, forming breathtaking scenery for visitors. In addition, May and June are the best season for bird watching.Kunlun Mountains: More than just mountainsAs the train keeps moving up, a picturesque view of the Kunlun Mountains appears before you. Reputed as the holy mountains, the Kunlun extend west from the Pamirs with a length of 2,500 kilometers. The 6,178-meter-high Yuzhu Peak is the highest of the Kunlun Mountains in Qinghai. The high peaks are covered with snow and mist all year round, creating a stunning view along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It's worth mentioning that Yuzhu Peak is the first sightseeing station for passengers, which allows them to get off the train and take photos outside. It is considered to be an ideal choice for hiking beginners as its route requires less technique.Hoh Xil Nature Reserve: 'Forbidden zone for humans'Hoh Xil, which means "green mountains" in Mongolian, is a plateau between the Kunlun and Tanggula mountain ranges, with an average altitude of 5,000 meters. Home to many wild animals, including the Tibetan antelope and the wild yak, Hoh Xil Nature Reserve is undoubtedly a desolate region in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The extensive area of alpine mountains and steppe systems is situated more than 4,500 meters above sea level, where sub-zero average temperatures prevail all year round. The geographic and harsh climatic conditions have made this place a "forbidden zone for humans," which is also a reason for its biodiversity. This is probably one of the few places left on Earth where one could get off the beaten track and find inner peace.  Tips:  As there are no signs in Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, visitors often get lost here. Remember to bring a local guide with you or rent a car to travel. Tsonag Lake: A 'soul lake' for TibetansLying in Amdo County, Nagqu Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tsonag Lake is one of the most significant holy lakes to local residents.  The Qinghai-Tibet railway passes right by the lake, making it the closest altiplano lake to the railway on the road. Passengers can take photos and capture the charming view of the lake as they would definitely have something to brag about on social media.Lhasa: The start of the journey to TibetThe final destination of the Qinghai-Tibet train trip â Lhasa, offers almost every aspect of Tibetan culture. If one must pick a name card for Lhasa, the Potala Palace is very likely to be the answer. No one can really say that he/she has visited Lhasa unless they have been to the Potala Palace â a must-see for travelers from home and abroad. Tibet is always full of incredible scenery. In early March when most of the plateau is still tinged with a wintry chill, Nyingchi Prefecture, in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, is blanketed with pink blossoms. If you want to record all the scenery along the sky road, seeing them yourself is not enough. The feelings from the bottom of your heart are important. So, what are you still waiting for? It's time to pack your bag and start the soul journey to Tibet where you could completely hand over yourself to nature and experience the unique Tibetan culture.  The fourth edition of Beijing Documentary Week which kicked off Tuesday is in full swing, bringing 54 selected documentaries and a series of exhibitions, seminars and cultural events to the capital. At a themed forum on Thursday, big names from the country's streaming services gathered to discuss how to produce documentaries that appeal to Generation Z.   When it comes to documentaries, many people think of educational films or series that are too dry to keep viewers' attention.  However for streaming services like Bilibili, Youku and iQiyi, documentaries are the best way to win over viewers, especially the younger ones, if you know what really speaks to them.  As part of the themed forum at this year's Beijing Documentary Week, representatives from these companies have come to share their stories at the China Millennium Monument Museum.  Bilibili, which started as ACG video platform, has a track record of success with younger generations like Gen Z in distributing documentaries in recent years.  Previous hit series on the platform include "The Story of CHUAN'ER" the popular grilled kebabs, which has been viewed over 200 million times through the first two seasons.  Zhu Xiangliang, senior adviser at the Documentary Department of Bilibili, told CGTN, "The documentaries distributed via new media platforms offer more interaction between the audience and the production team than ever before. For example, some viewers would make stickers or render clips of our documentaries in new ways, and these would bring more attention to the series. It's a positive succession."Zhu revealed that young viewers are equally attracted to themes like history and traditional crafts, contrary to conventional thinking.  A good example is Bilibili's two-season documentary which has taken a different angle on historic figures, like bringing the gourmet side of poet Su Shi. And technology also helps to bring a fresh perspective and a modern approach to documentaries. Zhang Wei, director of Youku Documentary Center, explained, "Creative storytelling methods like what we did with The Legend Hunters can give documentaries a new look to hook the younger generation. Mini mobile games are mixed into The Legend Hunters as a way to explain archaeological methodology and the science relevant to this site. In the near future we might see more interactive documentaries or even ones specifically designed for vertical screens." Beijing Documentary Week will also see the release of quality documentaries and themed screenings.  It runs till Tuesday, September 22. The fourth edition of Beijing Documentary Week which kicked off Tuesday is in full swing, bringing 54 selected documentaries and a series of exhibitions, seminars and cultural events to the capital.

And it's been practiced by some of the greats in European art. From German Renaissance figure DÃ¼rer to French impressionist Monet and even modernists Picasso and Matisse. The origins of copperplate etching can be traced back to Medieval Europe. An image is drawn on a copperplate then transferred onto paper using a printing press. The traditional method has evolved over centuries into an art form in its own right.Yang Hui, curator of Changyang Art Museum, said: "These copperplate prints are small and delicate. They are quite different from Chinese paintings, which are grand and magnificent. This exhibit gives people here in Beijing a chance to closely feel the charm of European art." Copper-plate etching arrived in China during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) by way of European missionaries and gained popularity during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), winning the emperor's favor in Emperor Qianlong's reign. Today, copperplate etching has become a form of cultural exchange between China and France. Guo Renzhi, a Beijing resident viewed the exhibition, said, "I'm in awe. The pieces are very detailed. The themes are colorful, even the ones on human figures and landscapes. The depictions are meticulous. When you look carefully, you'll see they're so vivid. Even if it's in black and white, you can still see how the brightness changes." The exhibit runs through October. An exhibition of French copperplate etching is underway in the Chinese capital, featuring collections from Li Keran Academy of Painting.  Over 200 copperplate prints on show from the Palace of Versailles use a technique that has a history of nearly 600 years and requires a certain degree of skill.

France, however, was still in a tough battle against the epidemic at that time. Both countries have overcome many difficulties to hold the exhibition, she added.At the exhibition is an innovative, immersive space that allows visitors to explore the origin and background stories about "Impression, Sunrise" via video clips and projections.It also holds a crossover collaboration with Team Wang, a home-grown streetwear label by Chinese pop star Jackson Wang, featuring a conceptual display space, "TEAM WANGÃMONET," on the third floor of the Bund One Art Museum, where the famous painting embraces a new interpretation and incorporates the images of landmarks in Shanghai and Paris like the Oriental Pearl Tower and Eiffel Tower.One of the greatest painters of the 20th century, Monet is a founder of French Impressionist painting and an unswerving advocate of the Impressionist style. His masterwork "Impression, Sunrise," which was created from a scene in the port of northwestern French city Le Havre, is credited with inspiring the name of the Impressionist movement.The exhibition will run through January 3, 2021.(Cover: A poster for the Claude Monet exhibition at the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai, China. /ambafrance.org)Groundbreaking artwork "Impression, Sunrise" by legendary French painter Claude Monet (1840-1926) made its China debut nearly 150 years after it was first shown at a Paris exhibition, stunning the world of art.Monet's 1872 masterpiece was unveiled on Wednesday at the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai, while a special exhibition in honor of the French impressionist painter takes place from Thursday, September 17, where Chinese viewers can have a close look at some of Monet's classics.In addition to the world-famed "Impression, Sunrise," the exhibition is showcasing a total of 47 French paintings, including nine of Monet's masterworks collected in the Marmottan Monet Museum in Paris, such as "Charing Cross Bridge, Smoke in the Fog" (1902) and "Sailing Boat, Evening Effect" (1885).The sunrise symbolizes new birth and hope, which seems more meaningful than ever since people are facing the COVID-19 pandemic, said Marianne Mathieu, the Marmottan's curatorial director.Myriam Kryger, cultural attache of the French consulate general in Shanghai, said the idea to exhibit "Impression, Sunrise" in China started around April as prevention and control measures in China began producing positive results.

That is the traditional culture of the Yi people," said Fan Chengyuan, head of Xianrendong, a village tucked away in southwest China's Yunnan Province.Xianrendong, which means "fairy cave" in Chinese, was plagued by extreme poverty for a very long time. In the 1990s, it was nicknamed the "Pocket Village" because of people's dire living conditions. Villagers largely relied on growing crops and fishing for a living and their average annual income was only 300 yuan (44 U.S. dollars) â approximately one-eighth of the national poverty line which is 2,300 yuan (339 U.S. dollars).Things have changed since. In 2019, per capita income jumped to 40,000 yuan (5,902 U.S. dollars) on average, making the village the richest in Qiubei County.Developing rural tourism with ethnic elementsThe nearby scenic spot of Puzhehei first started developing its tourism sector in the 1990s. As changes began to set in, people in the surrounding villages slowly started to see tourism as a viable method for escaping poverty as well.Home to 196 households, Xianrendong is inhabited by Yi people â one of the largest ethnic minority groups in China. It also boasts clear lakes and lush vegetation, offering abundant tourism resources.Seeing the potential business opportunity, Fan quit his previous job in the county and returned to the village in 2005. He then took out a bank loan to renovate old houses and convert them into homestay properties with traditional ethnic Yi style.Keeping local traditions and ethnic culture alive has become key to the village's tourism development. Fan said they studied the traditional architectural styles and upgraded the designs to make the houses more habitable and comfortable. Since 2013, yellow-brick cottages of two or three stories have sprung up across the village. They also revived traditional customs and events, ethnic handicrafts as well as folk songs and dances. During special occasions, the resident art troupe would stage singing and dancing performances around the bonfire, presenting a cultural feast for the visitors. This return to traditional culture has successfully brought a boon to the once impoverished village.As the village rose to fame and popularity, more job opportunities followed, covering the industries of agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, catering, accommodation and others. Today, many young people have returned home to start their own businesses.Last year, 5.85 million trips by domestic and foreign visitors were made to the Puzhehei scenic spot, bringing in 5.25 billion yuan (775 million U.S. dollars) in tourism revenue.(Cover image designed by Du Chenxin)"The development of rural tourism cannot come at the expense of [a place's] essence.

Now, with more exhibits dusting display cases and opening their doors again, a trip to the museum comes with mandatory mask-wearing and body temperature checks, hand sanitizer stations, social distancing markers and limits on visitor numbers. In the spirit of adapting to the new normal, museums have turned to the virtual space and museum patrons have warmed up to appreciating artwork from the comfort of their living room.This month, 16 museum curators from around the world sifted through their collections to choose their most favorite relics and shared them with a global audience in a nine-day art galore, which also featured discussions about the most pressing issues facing museums during these extraordinary times.The "Treasure Hunt Relay: Global Museum Director's Choice," which ran from September 6 to 15, was an initiative by The National Museum of China to help art lovers experience the power of culture wherever they were. The museum collaborated with 15 other cultural institutions across five continents to display prized artifacts and share the exciting history behind them, while weighing in on the opportunities and obstacles brought about by COVID-19.Every day, two curators held online presentations, revealing some of the cultural objects closest to their hearts. The relay began with the Beijing-based host museum and ended with the British Museum on Monday.About 90 percent of the museums worldwide were forced to temporarily shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak, and 13 percent could have their doors permanently closed, according to a May report jointly released by the UNESCO and International Council of Museums.The National Museum of China, for example, closed for 100 days before reopening on May 1, and currently caps the number of daily visitors at 8,000.In countries that rely heavily on tourism, the impact is even bigger. The number of visitors to the National Museum of Slovenia is now about 25 percent of that of last year. The Singapore-based Asian Civilizations Museum, which normally sees an average of 2,000 guests a day, is registering just 5 percent of the usual flow after reopening in June.The internet provided a way out for museums, which moved their exhibits and activities online in search of viable alternatives, with technology playing an important role in the conceptualization of fresh projects.The National Museum of China launched dozens of virtual exhibitions, including the first virtual exhibition on Chinese aerospace achievements, and a number of digital courses. The National Museum in Warsaw launched an app called Selfie, which allowed people to take pictures of their favorite works of art and upload them online. Meanwhile, the National Museum of Korea modified existing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) projects and moved them online."These opportunities also get the public to tell us how they were experiencing the pandemic. These things in their own right will become important documents telling the story of how people coped with this age," said Dr. Mathew Trinca, curator of the National Museum of Australia.As palaces for sheltering human civilization, connecting the past, present and future, "museums are important at this time because they sustain our people and give them a sense of hope and optimism, drawn from the study of experiences of people in the past," said Trinca."I think this is important for us now to know how human beings are resilient and [how] we've overcome obstacles like these in our shared long history on earth," he added.Marriage of cultures"Virtual space, cloud exhibition and live broadcast can reach beyond the limits of time and space, so that audiences from all over the world can understand our museums, enjoy the exquisite collections of the museums, and appreciate the brilliance and splendor of different civilizations," said Dr. Wang Chunfa, curator of the National Museum of China, during the relay's opening presentation.The rich collections of the U.S.-based Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art is an example of the convergence of cultures. Dr. Chase F.

So optical fibers are now connecting East and West," said Robinson when referring to the "Treasure Hunt Relay" project.The National Museum of the Sultanate of Oman also shared their appreciation to the Chinese culture, showing three Ming-Dynasty bowls, which attests to the long-lasting relationship and sea trade on the maritime Silk Road that connected Oman and China."Today we are witnessing the idea of a global world coming under increased reassessment, criticism, and scrutiny. We see nationalism become stronger again and perhaps a certain tendency of countries isolating themselves from others. I believe strongly that this movement, which comes way out of the past of an ever-growing connection globally, is irreversible," said Dr. Hartwig Fischer, curator of the British Museum.Fischer said that the possibility of working with the National Museum of China is a huge chance with an impact on the development of globalization.

Some of the exhibits have been displayed for the first time.Since its completion in 1420, the Forbidden City served as the imperial palace of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) Dynasties, with 24 emperors living and ruling there. It stands today as the concentrated embodiment of thought about urban planning and palace construction in ancient China.Exhibition explores the Forbidden City's past 600 yearsFollowing the timeline, the exhibition has been divided into three parts with 18 major historical events. The first part explains why the Forbidden City was planned and laid out as it is through the relationship between the imperial palace and the capital city.The second part, "Inclusiveness," focuses on the Forbidden City's look in ethnic elements after it was taken over by ethnic Manchu ruler during the Qing Dynasty and Western architectural style after the 18th century.The third part shows how the imperial palace was given new vitality after becoming a public museum and World Heritage Site and welcoming visitors both from home and abroad."The Forbidden City has a cultural foundation of several thousands of years, and architectural basis on the traditions of the Tang and Song Dynasties before evolving into its today's form," said Ren Wanping, deputy director of the Palace Museum and the general curator of the exhibition."I hope visitors perceive that the Forbidden City contains Chinese philosophical thought and humanistic spirit from our ceaseless culture passed down from generation to generation," she added.Rarely-seen cultural relics exhibitedThe exhibition displays many rarely-seen cultural relics, including the Empress's Winter Court Coronet used on her wedding day and the Jewel-inlaid Gold Cup with "Jin'ou youngu" (Everlasting Territory) Inscription used by the emperor on Chinese New Year's Eve.The ten Glazed Animal Ornaments, which stand together only on the eaves of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the largest and highest-level building in the Forbidden City, have been displayed together for the first time. On previous occasions, they were shown separately.Another treasure is the Lacquered Gauze, originally on the window partition in the south room of the Belvedere of Viewing Achievements (Fuwang ge). Painted with gold and silver, the exquisite fabric has six layers but it is easy for light to get through."This is the first time it is displayed for the public in the past over 200 years," said curator Zhang Jie, "Because of its fragile condition, it will be very hard for it to exhibit again in the future."The exhibition will last till November 15.(Cover image designer: Yin Yating)The Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, on Thursday inaugurated an exhibition featuring its planning, layout, architecture and court life to celebrate its 600th birthday.Titled "Everlasting splendor: Six centuries at the Forbidden City," the exhibition displays more than 450 cultural relics and historical photos in three halls on top of the Meridian Gate, or the Forbidden City's main entrance.

The pandemic has shut borders, grounded planes and forced people to trade their vacation for staycation during much of the first half of the year.As European countries slowly lift travel restrictions and open their doors again for foreign travelers in time for the summer holiday, the Swedes have been left out in the cold because of their government's coronavirus response.While Nordic countries opted for lockdowns and strict epidemic control measures, Stockholm took a different path, choosing a laid-back approach and putting faith in its citizens to behave responsibly. Sweden banned large gatherings, closed high schools and colleges and promoted social distancing. But it also allowed students under the age of 16 to continue to attend classes as bars, coffee shops and restaurants maintained business as usual.Sweden's economy dodged a bullet, but that came at a high human price as infections climbed and deaths surged, especially among the elderly. According to Johns Hopkins University, Sweden has recorded 73,061 COVID-19 cases and 5,433 fatalities so far. It has the fifth highest mortality rate in the world with 53.35 per 100,000 people.The light-touch strategy has drawn criticism from neighboring countries, with many still not welcoming Swedish tourists even after re-opening their borders to each other's nationals and to arrivals from nations further afield.But things might be taking a turn for the better, and the country on Tuesday recorded only 238 new infections, the lowest daily tally since May.Officials are betting that the downward trend of coronavirus cases could convince more countries to allow Swedes in â and that means passports can soon come in handy.

Baijiu is a Chinese spirit with a huge and loyal fan base, but I've heard all sorts of hyperbolic commentary about the high alcohol content and pungent taste.To try it out for myself, I wander through Beijing's hutongs (alleys formed by the city's traditional courtyard homes) and discover a baijiu bar tucked away in an artsy, up-and-coming neighborhood. I order a flight of baijiu shots and get an introduction to what baijiu is all about: sharp, bitter, and very strong, in my opinion. Let's just say it's probably not for the faint of heart. At this particular bar though, baijiu also comes in the form of cocktails featuring different juices, syrups, and bitters. Now we're talking!

Thailand is talking with China to a quarantine-free travel corridor by January to rescue its ailing tourism industry, the Bloomberg reported.Thailand Tourism Minister Phiphat Ratchakitprakarn said Thailand will reopen to foreign tourists in October with limitation.

However, from this object we can see that the technique has in fact already been practiced during the Sui Dynasty," said Lei.The exhibition featuring ceramic development between the third and ninth century runs through January 3 in 2021 at the M WOODS Art Museum.(Cover: Painted and glazed earthenware statuette of a mystical beast. /CGTN)A total of 125 ancient tombs, some of which date back to as early as the pre-Qin period (c.2100-221 BC), were found in an excavation at a high school in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, according to Guangzhou Municipal Institute of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology.Other cultural ruins discovered during the salvage archaeological excavation conducted between July to October at Guangdong Guangya High School include seven wells, four ditches, two ponds, as well as more than 470 (sets) cultural relics.The items date back to a wide range of the periods of China's history, from the pre-Qin period (221-206 B.C.), Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-AD 220), Jin Dynasty (265-420), Southern Dynasties (420-589), Tang Dynasty (618-907), Five Dynasties (907-960), Song Dynasty (960-1279), Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), to Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).The remains of the pre-Qin period are the most important archaeological findings, including 41 tombs, one well, and the cultural relics, such as pottery vessel, bronze dagger, bronze sword, bronze axe and jade slit ring.The tombs are the closest to and the most concentrated pre-Qin period remains discovered in Guangzhou so far, providing important material for exploring human activities in the region before the founding of the city.A tomb from the Han Dynasty contained more than 50 artifacts, including exquisitely-made models of livestock and poultry.A total of 125 ancient tombs, some of which date back to as early as the pre-Qin period (c.2100-221 BC), were found in an excavation at a high school in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, according to Guangzhou Municipal Institute of Cultural Heritage and Archaeology.Other cultural ruins discovered during the salvage archaeological excavation conducted between July to October at Guangdong Guangya High School include seven wells, four ditches, two ponds, as well as more than 470 (sets) cultural relics.The items date back to a wide range of the periods of China's history, from the pre-Qin period (221-206 B.C.), Han Dynasty (206 B.C.-AD 220), Jin Dynasty (265-420), Southern Dynasties (420-589), Tang Dynasty (618-907), Five Dynasties (907-960), Song Dynasty (960-1279), Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), to Qing Dynasty (1644-1911).The remains of the pre-Qin period are the most important archaeological findings, including 41 tombs, one well, and the cultural relics, such as pottery vessel, bronze dagger, bronze sword, bronze axe and jade slit ring.The tombs are the closest to and the most concentrated pre-Qin period remains discovered in Guangzhou so far, providing important material for exploring human activities in the region before the founding of the city.A tomb from the Han Dynasty contained more than 50 artifacts, including exquisitely-made models of livestock and poultry.From silver-haired old men to children who just learnt how to speak, people of the Nu ethnic group can sing and dance, and almost all of them are quite talented.

Pubs and bars will close temporarily and socializing prohibited indoors, but universities and retail shops will stay open.High level measures will be applied to Manchester and Nottinghamshire, meaning socializing indoors will be banned and the rule of six applied in outdoor settings, but pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open, as across the rest of the country, until 10 p.m.  Those areas placed on the medium tier will continue to follow national guidelines, with bars and pubs closing at 10 p.m. and the rule of six applied outdoors.The UK government response is for England only, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland implementing their own strategies to deal with the pandemic.Johnson says the new system is designed to avoid another national lockdown, which he says would cause long-term economic damage."This is not how we want to live our lives," he said. "But it is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic costs of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."  Johnson added: "The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country. I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed."The prime minister and his scientific advisers will continue to monitor the number of cases in each area, which could lead to an increasing number of towns and cities facing the most severe measures.England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained why cases of COVID-19 have risen so sharply the north of England compared with the rest of the country. "The epidemic this time has clearly picked up pace in the north of England earlier than it did in the first wave and that almost certainly relates to the fact that disease levels in the north never dropped, and certainly in the northwest, they never dropped as far as they dropped in the summer as they did in the south."Johnson also announced a further economic package would be introduced to replace the furlough scheme, which comes to an end at the end of this month. The support will cover two-thirds of the wages for employees of businesses forced to close as a result of the new virus restrictions.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a new three-level COVID-19 alert system across England as cases continue to rise across the country.Infection rates have quadrupled in England in the past month, and hospital admissions have doubled. The new system will apply localized measures of varying severity to the worst-hit areas of the country, with regions placed into one of three levels â medium, high or very high. Liverpool has been placed in the very high level with measures set to be imposed from Wednesday.

Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home. Jason Huth, an English teacher in Beijing, was one who decided not to travel during the holiday. "I chose to stay for a few reasons; partly because I had just got back to Beijing a few weeks ago after being stuck abroad since Chinese New Year, partly because my school strongly advised teachers not to travel too far away from Beijing due to fears of having to quarantine upon return."Many international schools and companies advised staff against travel during the break. Aletta Magrieta Strauss, a Beijing-based art teacher, said she thought this was reasonable. "If there was an outbreak and I had to quarantine as a result, work would not cover the cost. They (international schools) have already lost a lot of money and are still trying to get staff back into China."With many people having extra money to spend due to not traveling earlier in the year, and with the onus being on safety and comfort, high-end hotels saw a boom in business. Of all hotel bookings made on Trip.com during the October holiday, four- and five-star accommodation accounted for nearly half. It's anticipated that the effect will be lasting, as more people get used to the idea of "luxury staycations."This year's October holiday saw a resurgence in domestic tourism, with 637 million trips being recorded in eight days.

Domestic tourism revenue recovered 69.9 percent year on year.The reports released by several online travel platforms showed that the homestay inns were "difficult to book" during the holiday, and the popularity of the homestay industry even exceeded the same period last year.Judging from the occupancy trend, September 29 and 30 were the busiest days for homestay inns. Starting from the night of October 1, the occupancy rate showed explosive growth, and reached its peak on October 2 and lasted until October 6. The popularity of homestaysAccording to a report released by Tujia Homestay, China's short-term lodging rental platform, homestay bookings for this year's National Day Golden Week recovered to 95 percent from the same period last year. Among them, homestays in the countryside performed well, with platform booking volume reaching 120 percent from the same period last year.For example, the Huang He Su Ji hotel groups, a luxury homestay alliance comprised of five major domestic hotel operators, in Zhongwei, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, were fully occupied for the entire holiday."All the tourists who want to go abroad for holidays due to the COVID-19 pandemic have shifted to domestic, so high-end holiday products have been trending this year," said Ma Li, co-founder of Huang He Su Ji.Read more: Travelogue: Luxury hotel group helps transform desert into destination"The occupancy rate of Huang He Su Ji kept 100 percent from May to now, and visitors usually booked two months in advance almost, which is completely higher than the same period last year," added Ma.Qian Jiliang, president of Moganshan's homestay association, also told ThePaper that the average occupancy rate of homestays was about 90 percent during National Day last year, and more than 95 percent during this year's National Day, up five percentage points from the same period last year.Of course, there are occupancy rates that fell short of expectations.According to the ThePaper, the average occupancy rate at a homestay in Lijiang, a popular tourist destination, during National Day this year has been about 70 percent to 75 percent, according to an insider familiar with the Lijiang's homestay industry."The situation in Lijiang is much worse than last year," the person said.

newspaper, the 11 countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than three months also being eligible.Eligible travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 before entering Japan and upon arrival in Japan, while their sponsors, such as companies or organizations which support them, will be expected to ensure their self-isolation for 14 days, during which time they will not be allowed to use public transport.The government had said it would consider permitting 1,000 foreigners into the country per day, mainly to accommodate those who intend to stay for three months or longer, while looking to increasing the cap in the months ahead.Foreigners with resident status here who had been overseas have recently been allowed to re-enter the county, while expatriates and other long-term residents from some Asian countries have also been granted access into the country.These include those from Vietnam, Thailand and a number of other economies with which reciprocal agreements have been made.The Japanese government has more recently made similar reciprocal agreements with Singapore and Brunei.Currently, people from 159 countries and regions have been denied entry to the country, but Japan has steadily been easing its entry restrictions. (Cover: Japan. /CFP) Japan is reportedly planning to ease travel restrictions to China and

that's all over after British Airways retired the fleet.It's easy to blame this on the COVID-19 pandemic, but truth be told, the 747 has had its day. Four fuel-guzzling engines have been replaced by two, and modern technology has left this massive people-carrier behind.But as with so many things in this pandemic, the inevitable has been accelerated â and this is still an industry gasping for survival.  On Wednesday evening, the UK's transport secretary, Grant Shapps, took to social media to reassure the aviation sector that it hadn't been forgotten.He tweeted: "We are moving ahead with the next step to reduce the travel quarantine period by launching the Global Travel Taskforce to open up international travel and boost our businesses."The task force will implement a testing regime to reduce the self-isolation period, along with a wide range of other measures to enable travel while keeping down infection rates.What everyone wants to see is quicker testing at the airports. So passengers can quickly verify their state of health and therefore avoid the exhaustive quarantine measures that have prevented passengers from bothering traveling.Currently under limited trial in Asia are digital health passports. A record for passengers who have taken a test within 72 hours to ensure a safe passage through international security.  The trial moves to the UK and Europe next week.The government's COVID-19 "safe list" of countries grows shorter by the day and gradually across the globe moments of access are being closed off again as much of the world braces itself for the second wave most knew would come but somehow hoped to avoid.Low-cost airline easyJet is now forecasting more than $1 billion in losses this year, confounding even pessimistic analysts' predictions.So far, the company has borrowed in the region of $800 million from the government, sold off aircraft and cut 4,500 jobs.Still it's calling for more action from the government.The airline says it will fly just 25 percent of its planned capacity for the rest of this year, behind rival Ryanair, which is aiming for 40 percent in October. The lumbering bulk of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet accelerating through the rain at London's Heathrow Airport has been a familiar sight since 1971 â but that's all over after British Airways retired the fleet.It's easy to blame this on the COVID-19 pandemic, but truth be told, the 747 has had its day.

It took only 3 years to build, and first went into operation 6 years ago.Chen Xin felt curious and excited when he first boarded a bullet train 6 years ago. He still remembers the day he got into a bullet train cab for the first time. He wasn't allowed to touch the control desk because his teacher was afraid that he might do something wrong and force the train to stop. Now he's become one of the best bullet train drivers in Xinjiang.Before 2011, Chen drove either diesel or electric locomotives. But he says driving bullet trains is very different, and much better."Diesel and electric locomotives don't seal properly. Sand still gets inside, even when the windows are closed," Chen said. He had to clean up the sand or it could have damaged the control desk and other devices in the cabin."Now bullet trains are wind and sand proof. So I can focus on my work, safely taking passengers to their destinations," he added.Xinjiang's first high-speed rail line officially opened in November 2014, connecting the region's capital city Urumqi with Hami, a city in east Xinjiang. The 530-kilometer trip used to take 4-6 hours. Today, it takes only 2.5 hours. Traveling by bullet train has now become a new way of life for the locals.Despite the transformation that high-speed railway has brought to the city, for Chen, one thing hasn't changed. That is the sense of responsibility."No matter what kind of locomotives you're driving, you should stick to your sense of responsibility. You should be responsible for yourself, your passengers, as well as the state property," he told CGTN.Chen has witnessed the railway's development in Xinjiang, from diesel locomotives to electric, and now bullet trains. What impressed him the most are the greater levels of efficiency as well as the working environment.The speed limit for trains in Xinjiang is now two times higher than before and Chen believes it'll be three times faster in the foreseeable future.The bullet train is changing people's way of life in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and boosting the region's economic potential.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

In its holds we discovered military vehicles, porcelain and many crates with contents still unknown."The Karlsruhe had been taking part in Operation Hannibal, one of the largest sea evacuations in history, which helped more than one million German troops and civilians from East Prussia escape the Soviet advance towards the end of World War II.  Documentation from the time suggests the boat left Koenigsberg in a hurry, with a large cargo and 1,083 people onboard."All this, put together, stimulates the human imagination. Finding the German steamer and the crates with contents as yet unknown resting on the bottom of the Baltic Sea may be significant for the whole story," said diver Tomasz Zwara.The Amber Room was constructed in Prussia and then given to Tsar Peter the Great of Russia in 1716 as a present.The Germans dismantled it and took it to Koenigsberg during the war, from where it disappeared during Allied bombing raids on the city. Many believe it was destroyed.

They were already down about 80 percent this year, due to the impact of the pandemic on the entertainment industry.  The company reopened its UK cinemas in July but customers numbers have been small since then.Cineworld's CEO, Moody Greidinger, said it was "not a decision we made lightly.""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings," he added. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time."Greidinger's statement also highlighted the challenges the firm faced in getting studios to release new movies.  Cineworld was hoping the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, could help turn around its fortunes. But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added. The world's second largest cinema chain, Cineworld, is temporarily shutting its theaters in the U.S. and the UK.The move is due to low footfall as a result of COVID-19 and puts 45,000 jobs at risk, including 5,500 in the UK.Cineworld's shares in London plunged more than 50 percent at one stage on Monday.

He's been in this occupation for seven years so far, the period of which, nonetheless, is just a fraction of that of his father and grandfather.The apple doesn't fall far from the treeThe story began in 1958 when his grandfather Li Wangfu, a native of east China's Shandong, went from Dandong Railway Bureau to Xining on a job transfer. "I arrived here on August 15, 1958," Li Wangfu told CGTN. In his 80s, he still remembers the date clearly. After a long bumpy ride, what appeared before his eyes was a barren land where the sun blazed down straight.When the Xining railway depot was set up in October 1959, Li Wangfu became one of the few train inspectors on the sparsely populated plateau. Back then, he hunted troubles and made overhauls with a slew of clumsy tools in the daytime and lived in a cellar, which he and his colleagues dug by themselves, on a dust hill just south to the garage of the station, at night."At that time, we went to wherever they needed us," he said. Every day he went off work with his coats soaked in black engine oil. Hard work paid off. He became one of the first train inspection chiefs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1984 â the year when the railroad linking Xining and Golmud, respectively the first and second largest city of Qinghai Province, started operation.Like father, like son. Li Xiujin's foray into train maintenance was hugely impacted by his father Li Wangfu. "My father once took me on his train, I felt it was really a good job," he recalled. In 1983, he was assigned to the Golmud Depot. "Back then, it took us over two days to travel from Xining to Golmud, where sands and pebbles were flying around."Li Xiujin and his colleagues lived in a small, drafty mud hut and carried repair hammers along with them to work every day. Over the past 37 years, he witnessed the booming development of railway technologies, which has largely facilitated train inspection.The Qinghai railway system introduced an array of automatic detecting machines in 2012, amid a nationwide tech-driven development momentum. Li Xiujin learned state-of-the-art technology and became a TFDS (Train of Freight Failures Detection System) centralized analyst. "Now I can check around 300 trains every day on computer."Repair and maintenance work used to rely more on experience but now "comprehensive skills" based on technical know-how are also required to guarantee the safety of passengers, according to third-generation Li Haifeng.From steam locomotives to electric trainsIn the 1950s and 1960s, what the train offered was a bottom-rattling, days-long ride â that was the era when steam reigned railroads. Steam locomotives helped thrust the world into the first industrial revolution and have since forged ahead the human civilization for the next 150 years.In China, the production and use of steam locomotives continued into the late 1980s though most of them were phased out at a much earlier time. In the 1960s, steam trains led the development of the country's railroad networks, driving its socio-economic development.Li Wangfu witnessed the antiques being gradually sifted out and the debut of internal combustion trains and then electric trains. "We're all electrified now."Over the past decades, China's train technology is all but obsolete. His son and grandson saw more unfathomable developments. "Previously on the Xining-Golmud section, the train ran at merely some 50 kilometers per hour, but now it could reach 160 kilometers," noted Li Haifeng.Now China has the world's biggest high-speed railway network, along with advanced inspecting methods for the facilities and equipment on the train."We have switched from heavy manual labor to mental work, just like a physician in a hospital," said Li Xiujin, "We just sit indoors, watch pictures taken by high-speed cameras, and report problems to on-site inspectors with the help of TFDS."For Li Haifeng, the work is much less laborious but requires more expertise. The train he works on has a UV filter inbuilt in its window, oxygen generators, and automatic excrement processing devices amid a variety of new facilities."Working on the train is tough, as you need to take into account the safety of every passenger. It's like being a 'doctor' who knows everything about the train and gives the right prescription," Li Haifeng said.Video director: Yu YingtianCameraman: Guo YuanhengText by Wang XiaonanCopy editor: Oscar MargainVoiceover: Sim Sim WissgottProduction assistant: Yu WenwenProducer: Zhang XiaoheSupervisor: Zhang Shilei"I'm continuing the dream of my father and grandfather," said Li Haifeng, a train inspector at the Xining Depot â the place where the trains on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway blew their first whistle.Thirty-one-year-old Li has been investigating and troubleshooting undetected faults in the facilities of each coach to ensure the safety of every train journey.

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

It is the first long holiday over three days since the coronavirus epidemic broke out in January.The tourism industry suffered a heavy blow during the epidemic. With the epidemic largely under control in the country, people are pinning high hopes on the holiday for a tourism boost. Preferential price stimulates tourism boomOne month before the holiday, travel agencies introduced various discounts and subsidies to attract tourists.China's top online travel platform Ctrip rolled out 1 billion yuan of subsidies for the National Day holiday on September 7, while its contender Fliggy backed by Alibaba announced a 10-billion-yuan-subsidy plan one day after. These can be used to book train tickets, hotels and scenic spot tickets.For example, if the subsidies are properly used, the ticket price for Shanghai Disney Resort can reach as low as 199 yuan compared to its normal price of 500 to 700 yuan, and the ticket price for some popular destinations, such as Beijing's Palace Museum and Guangzhou Chimelong Tourist Resort, can be halved.Scenic spots themselves have also striven to attract more visitors, with more than 500 across China exempting or reducing ticket prices.

Beijing is scheduled to hand out 12.5 million vouchers in seven batches in October, among which are meal vouchers used in onsite restaurants and take-away food.Epidemic prevention measures taken to keep safetyTo meet the tourists' demand during the holiday, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism recently raised the capped number of tourists from 50 percent to 75 percent in scenic spots.The Palace Museum raised the limited number of visitors from 12,000 to 30,000 since Thursday, the most since it reopened. But visitors should book the ticket online in advance, which is a common practice in most scenic spots across the country.Tourists are also arranged to visit in staggered time.

People across the country reunite with family and friends, and enjoy the charm of moon together. Some people will choose to watch Peking Opera during the festivities, classic opera "Drunken Concubine" is one of the most widely circulated ones. It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera.

People across the country reunite with family and friends, and enjoy the charm of moon together. Some people will choose to watch Peking Opera during the festivities, classic opera "Drunken Concubine" is one of the most widely circulated ones. It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera.

When they settled down in the Jingmai Mountain, they cultivated tea trees near their village together with the Dai people, turning the mountain into a huge tea garden. Now, the Jingmai Mountain in Pu'er City in southwest China's Yunnan Province is hailed as the world's natural museum of tea trees. The ancient Jingmai tea garden occupies a land area of 1.867 hectares, and 43 percent of them can be picked by the local. The Jingmai Mountain is also an important spot on the the ancient Tea Horse Road.

The themed flower parterre along Chang'an Avenue has also been in place to welcome the upcoming National Day.  The themed flowerbeds along Chang'an Avenue were created with over 200 flower varieties and depict themes including "all-around well-off society" and "hard-won battle against the epidemic," highlighting the historical achievements in the course of the country's development.  In Harbin City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, a symphony concert titled "Me and My Motherland" was held Wednesday.  The residents in Yuncheng City, north China's Shanxi Province, also expressed their love for the motherland through music by organizing a community variety show with various song and dance performances.    Reuniting with friends and loved ones is customary during the festive celebrations. In Gongliu County of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, neighbors and friends from near and far gathered to make and enjoy local delicacies like Dapanji, or big plate chicken stew, and moon cakes.  "We put pomegranate seeds on moon cakes, signifying that people of all ethnic groups remain closely united like the seeds of a pomegranate that stick together, and we all live a prosperous life," resident Guzinay told CGTN.  The attractions and featured streets in many places were lit up with dazzling lights, forming gorgeous night scenes.  At the Yellow River Tower in Lanzhou City, northwest China's Gansu Province, a 3D projection light show was held with dazzling lights illuminating the mother river and the night sky.  In Nanjing City, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, the nighttime economy injects vitality into Changjiang Road, a popular scenic spot with 1,800 years of history.  Tourists can visit the night market, taste delicious food and watch a show at the theater.    "I think it's good to bring my kid here to experience the culture and distinctive atmosphere of Nanjing," said resident Zhang Xiao.  In Hezhou City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 2,300 drones changed formations in the night sky from time to time, forming patterns like the Chinese national flag and Tiananmen Rostrum, bringing viewers a visual feast.  In Shangqiu City, central China's Henan Province, a marvelous molten iron-splashing show awed spectators.  Listed as a national intangible cultural heritage item, the molten iron-splashing performance features one blacksmith throwing a ladle of molten iron up to the sky and another blacksmith beating the molten iron with a wooden club, creating a fascinating firework-like display to usher in the new year and extend wishes for good harvests. The activity can be traced back more than 1,000 years ago.In Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the ancient city wall was lit in red, and the words "Celebrate National Day" and "I love you, motherland" were projected on its surface.

It provides help to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in the area, such as English lessons and financial budgeting.She thinks the UK should be doing more to provide safe and legal routes for asylum and said "shutting the door in people's faces isn't going to make this issue go away."Chapman added: "In the grand scheme of displaced people in the world, it's a relatively small number and the UK really does need to do its bit. France takes four times as many asylum applications as we do. Germany takes 10 times as many."But not everyone thinks Britain should be as welcoming, particularly in the middle of a global COVID-19 pandemic that has curtailed travel for millions of people worldwide. On the streets of Dover, there appeared to be support for tougher immigration policies."They all come over here. They could be murderers, terrorists and no one's stopping them. They're pretending to be children and they're like 30 years old," said Leigh, a local resident."It's about time somebody put a stop to it, isn't it?" said Janet, another Dover resident. "I mean, we haven't got any schools, we've got no hospitals, we've got nothing. So how can we bring all these extra people in?" she added.Daniel, 32, said the arrivals had transformed the area: "The population has gone from a normal, British civilization to â¦ half of us aren't even British. Come on, we're not being funny, who's pure British these days?"The sentiments highlight the concern and anger felt by some parts of the UK's population about a perceived lack of control of its borders.The issue of immigration was a key part of the Brexit debate, which culminated in Britain's departure from the European Union. Soon, that will mean an end to the free movement of people to and from the EU. But for many migrants, their journey to the UK is often long and perilous."They come from places where there are problems: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Sudan are common countries, also Syria, of course," said Chapman, back at the refugee center.Britain's government wants to make it easier to return potential asylum seekers who arrive from France and said smuggling gangs are profiting from the latest surge.Figures at the end of September suggest around 7,000 had made the journey, more than three times as many as in the whole of 2019.The latest increase in arrivals looks unlikely to stop any time soon. It's a journey that could mean life or death â but for the thousands attempting it, reaching the UK is worth risking the ultimate price.September has been the busiest month on record for migrants attempting to cross the English Channel.Around 2,000 people have been picked up by the UK's Border Force this month, many on small boats or dinghies, which are often unsafe.The UK recently beefed up patrols in the world's busiest shipping lane to dissuade people from embarking on the journey, often from France.The issue is being particularly felt in places such as Dover, a picturesque town in southern England where many migrants first arrive.  Bridget Chapman works with the nearby Kent Refugee Action Network. It provides help to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in the area, such as English lessons and financial budgeting.She thinks the UK should be doing more to provide safe and legal routes for asylum and said "shutting the door in people's faces isn't going to make this issue go away."Chapman added: "In the grand scheme of displaced people in the world, it's a relatively small number and the UK really does need to do its bit. France takes four times as many asylum applications as we do. Germany takes 10 times as many."But not everyone thinks Britain should be as welcoming, particularly in the middle of a global COVID-19 pandemic that has curtailed travel for millions of people worldwide. On the streets of Dover, there appeared to be support for tougher immigration policies."They all come over here. They could be murderers, terrorists and no one's stopping them. They're pretending to be children and they're like 30 years old," said Leigh, a local resident."It's about time somebody put a stop to it, isn't it?" said Janet, another Dover resident. "I mean, we haven't got any schools, we've got no hospitals, we've got nothing. So how can we bring all these extra people in?" she added.Daniel, 32, said the arrivals had transformed the area: "The population has gone from a normal, British civilization to â¦ half of us aren't even British.

However, it is hard to spot Victorine Obola's small photo studio, despite it being one of the busiest places inDunga. People from all over Kisumu county flock here to capture their memorable moments on the shores of the largest freshwater lake in Africa.Some are photographed while on the beach while others prefer to have their photos deep into the waters while boat riding. Weekends ushers in a beehive of activities for friends and families who want to experience the cool breeze here, eat fish, or just while away time.This is where Miss Obola plies her trade and this has turned her into the most sought-after photographer on the beach. This is manifested in the long ques of people lining up waiting for their photographs to be processed in her studio.She juggles between her interests in photography and the highly competitive but male-dominated profession of being a coxswain."What happened is that while doing door-to-door photography in the market, I saw a school bus by the roadside,â she says. "I went near it and talked to the driver and requested them if the teacher would want some photos to be taken because it seemed they had come for a tour. So they accepted. They told me they were looking for a photographer but they did not know where to get one. So I got onto the bus, we went to Kisumu Airport, then Kisumu Lakeport took them some photos, then they came to Dunga beach for boat riding,âShe was also fortunate to be admitted by the Dunga Beach Management, to practice her trade here. She however did not know that she would end up also doubling as a coxswain.Initially, she had been working in a photography studio owned that time by a member of parliament in Kisumu city."I had a passion for photography. I decided to go to my member of Parliament who employed me in his studio. I worked there for one year.â"After that I decided to buy a small camera, using my savings. It cost around Ksh.8000/$80.The first day I went to Kibuye, the jua kali sector, I talked to a few people. Luckily the first day I got Ksh.350/$3.I also took photos of my neighbors.âAfter getting a permit to work as a photographer at the beach, she also saw another opportunity. An opportunity to learn boat-riding skills and earn an extra coin."Since I had a passion in physics and there are some topics that we were taught in high-school concerning navigation, navigating a ship, I just had the interest and so I talked to some coxswains around to see if they could train me and they accepted.âBut what happens in case there are clients who need their moments at the beach captured on camera and those who need to be boat ridden in the Victorian waters?"There are so many male coxswains around, but in case I get a customer who wants boat riding, I talk to my fellow photographers to help me as I do the boat riding, âShe says.Her job requires an agile person and who is hawk-eyed to be able to spot clients streaming into the beach. But not just that, one needs to be patient and persuasive to convince them to be photographed and part with some cash rather than using their own phones to do it."The major obstacle is this era of digital. Personally, I trained using a manual camera, but people come with their phones. You just have to explain and tell them why you want them to use your camera," Obola submits.Additionally, she says, with regards to being a coxswain, there are customers who do not have confidence in a woman. But some only want to be taken to the lake by a lady, and if it's not her turn because they ride these boats in turns, they refuse to go with male coxswain.Obola however says she faces those challenges in stride knowing that her two jobs help her put food on the table as well as educate her siblings."I come from a family of nine. I am the 6th born and I am the breadwinner because I have been able to educate my three siblings in high school and university level using the same photography and boat riding work.âIt has been four years of photography and boat-riding at Lake Victoria. But for the 36-year-old Obola, expanding her territory is her biggest dream now.The Kenyan government has established a marine school at the Port of Kisumu and Miss Obola wants to take advantage of the institution to hone her boat-riding skills and become a certified coxswain soon."If the light of God illuminates my life one day one time, I get a speed boat, after having gotten the certificate to do my own, have my own boat because these ones are not mine.â"And as for my photography, my ambition is to have a big studio right in the town center with big digital machines plus the latest machines for lamination in bulk so that customers will be coming to do their photo-shoot and get what they want," she concludes.As we finish our interview with her, she smiles at the next clients who want to be photographed. She quickly bids us goodbye and tells me that life is to be lived and to be enjoyed but the biggest step is to not fear anything.When one visits Kisumu city lying on the western parts of Kenya at the shores of Lake Victoria, one cannot miss an opportunity to sample some of its beautiful beaches among them, Dunga beach that is just an 8 kilometers drive from the city center.The beach is alive thanks to various activities going on.

Besides buying mooncakes, the occasion is also marked in artistic ways.Making Chinese tea is quite a complicated and demanding job. The tea leaves, the tools and every procedure counts. At the Dajue Temple in Beijing, a demonstration showcases how to make green tea properly."Chinese tea culture has a history of thousands of years," said Murong Zigui, director of the Minghui Teahouse. "Every year, we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Day at the Dajue Temple. We hope that people would always remember this quiet and happy moment in their life, drinking tea and watching Guqin performance at this ancient site."Such events featuring traditional Chinese culture are frequently held at the temple for the past 20 years. Tasting tea and playing Guqin, a seven-string musical instrument, was a way for friends to spend time together in ancient China.Guqin artist Yang Qing believes that the two art forms share something in common. "The taste of Chinese tea is considered to be mild, restrained and it has a lingering aftertaste. And the sound of Guqin is considered heavy and rich, inspiring positive sentiments from the bottom of one's heart. Both art forms give people a feeling of jade-like warmness and smoothness, and are deeply favored by Chinese people," he said.In distant Luxembourg, a similar celebration featuring Chinese tea culture has also been held. The relaxing occasion, as its Chinese organizers say, is supposed to allow people to release some stress during the pandemic."We organized Wenshi Tea ceremonies for French friends to introduce them this traditional way of drinking tea that originated from the Tang Dynasty. I feel that French people are really interested in that," said Duan Xiaoyang, president of the Sino-European Association for Art and Intercultural Communication.Various celebrations are taking place across China and abroad to celebrate this year's traditional Mid-Autumn Festival.

Residents in seven areas, including the cities Newcastle and Sunderland, will no longer be allowed to socialize indoors with people outside their household or social bubble. Â· Only one in eight countries have introduced measures to specifically protect women from the impact of the pandemic, according to a database of government responses launched by two UN agencies.  ACROSS EUROPEIsobel Ewing in BudapestHungary's registered case numbers keep climbing, with 851 new cases recorded on Tuesday and eight deaths.There are more than 25,500 active cases in the country.According to virus experts, virologists, mathematicians and experts from Hungary's Ministry of Innovation and Technology (ITM), the number of deaths is expected to rise sharply in early October. The experts said that 90 to 95 percent of COVID-19 cases in Hungary are not officially registered as cases and the sufferers are not in quarantine.Although the number of tests has increased since the first wave in Hungary, many experts have pointed out that if the rate of positive results among the tests is too high â according to the WHO, if it exceeds five percent â that means the country is not performing enough tests.In Hungary, this indicator has not fallen below 5 percent since the beginning of September, and sometimes even exceeded 10 percent.  Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamTo stop the spread of COVID-19, the Netherlands introduced stricter guidelines on Monday. Face masks will be recommended in stores in the largest three cities, but not mandatory, because of legal restrictions. Businesses, however, can refuse clients who are not wearing face masks. Restaurants and bars will have to close at 10 p.m. and can only receive a maximum number of 30 guests at a time. Supermarkets need to reserve two specified shopping hours per day for the elderly and others in vulnerable health. Working at home becomes the strict norm unless that is virtually impossible. Spectators are no longer allowed at sporting events. Mayors have the power to close places not respecting the rules. The new measures will come into effect on Tuesday at 6 p.m. local time.  Ross Cullen in ParisThe French prime minister will meet representatives of the hospitality sector on Tuesday morning as anger grows in Marseille over the forced closure of bars and restaurants. On Monday, 100 business owners tried to block some road tunnels and part of a motorway in Marseille in protest at the shutdown measures that have forced the closure of all cafes, pubs and bistros in the city for the next two weeks to try to control the surge in new coronavirus measures. The move affects Marseille and Aix-en-Provence but 11 other cities in France have had to impose a 10 p.m. closing time on bars. Andrew Wilson in LondonPrime Minister Boris Johnson was forced to apologize after mistakenly saying people living in high-risk areas of England's North East region were able to meet indoors with others from different households, despite fines being in place against such action. "This is vital to control the spread of coronavirus and keep everyone safe. If you are in a high-risk area, please continue to follow the guidelines from local authorities."

The authorities suggest that tourists pay attention to their safety and check ticket reservations have been confirmed before traveling.Scenic attractions have increased capacity for visitorsBecause Mid-Autumn Festival coincides with the National Day holiday in 2020, this year's Golden Week holiday is one day longer than usual, and the eight-day holiday has made Chinese tourists even more eager to go out.China State Railway Group said on Monday that the National Day railway rush will start on September 28. From September 28 to October 8, China's railways are expected to carry 108 million passengers, an average of 9.82 million per day.October 1 will be the peak, with an estimated 13 million passengers on the rails, the highest daily passenger flow since the outbreak of the pandemic, the group said.In order to meet the needs of tourists, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has lifted the upper limit for visitors at cultural and tourist locations from 50 percent to 75 percent of capacity.According to a notice released by the authority of Mount Huashan scenic area on September 28, the daily maximum passenger flow limit will be 20,000 and ticket sales will be stopped when the limit is reached.Meanwhile, starting from September 28, the maximum daily capacity for visitors to Mount Huangshan has been expanded from 25,000 to 37,500.From September 25, the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang City also raised the maximum daily limit of each ticket type to 75 percent of the normal capacity.Tickets to popular attractions are hard to getThe eight-day Golden Week has inspired people to travel. Some scenic attractions are already booked up, with popular spots such as the Palace Museum selling out from October 1 to 8.Tickets for the Jiuzhaigou Sparkling Lake in Sichuan Province from October 2 to 4 have also sold out.The ministry urged travelers to book tickets to scenic spots in advance.No booking, no travelShan Gangxin, deputy head of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism's resource development department, said that tourism sites should be opened and tickets booked in an orderly manner under the premise of overall prevention and control of the pandemic.The ministry also reminded tourists to understand and inquire in advance about epidemic prevention and control measures, opening hours, ticket reservations and passenger flow restrictions so as to ensure "no booking, no travel."For example, the Mount Huashan scenic area in northwest China's Shaanxi Province requires all tourists to register with the Shaanxi Health Code before booking tickets. Those with a green health code can book tickets, while those with a yellow or red code cannot.The Mount Huangshan scenic area in east China's Anhui Province also requires visitors to show a successful test or a matching ID card with health code and undertake a temperature test before entering the scenic area.Minimize 'unnecessary outbound travel'The Department of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded Chinese citizens to pay close attention to security alerts and overseas epidemic information issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassies and consulates. It also urged travelers to fully assess the serious risks of cross-infection and the long quarantine period brought by international travel and minimize "unnecessary travel."(Cover image from CFP)With Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day approaching, some popular scenic attractions in China, such as the Palace Museum, are already booked up for the holiday, while other attractions are selling out fast.

Read our guide to the most widely used including the Antibody, PCR and Antigen tests â explaining exactly what they do, how much they cost and how accurate they are.When the immune system is exposed to COVID-19, it produces IgG antibodies to fight the virus. A COVID-19 antibody test looks for IgG antibodies in a blood sample â if present, that means you have had the illness. Studies have shown antibodies are produced approximately 14 days after the start of the illness, so the best time to take the test is 14 to 21 days after feeling unwell.What does a positive result mean?A positive result means you have been exposed to the virus and your immune system has produced antibodies in response. A small number of people may have had the virus and produced antibodies without ever feeling unwell, meaning they are asymptomatic carriers. What does a negative result mean?A true negative result means the immune system hasn't produced antibodies because you haven't been exposed to the virus. However, a false negative is when you have been exposed to the virus but antibodies haven't been identified, either because the test was taken too soon or the body simply hasn't produced antibodies to fight the virus.Is the test accurate?The Roche antibody test widely used in the UK is 100 percent accurate in identifying IgG antibodies and 99.8 percent accurate in determining that there are no antibodies in the bloodstream. However, the timings of the test (pictured above) mean false negatives can occur, so it's imperative the test is taken within the 14-to-21-day window for optimal accuracy.How much does it cost?In the UK, only certain people who work in social care in England and Wales are able to get an antibody test for free. Otherwise, they must be bought at private clinics, with prices starting at $84. In Germany, the same test costs $76.How long will it take to get my results?Results typically take up to 72 hours from private health services. The PCR test is used to detect whether the COVID-19 virus is currently present in your body. This is done by looking for evidence of the virus's genetic material, known as RNA, from a swab sample taken from the nose and back of the throat. In the lab, a reagent is added to the sample â if the RNA is present the reagent sparks a chain reaction so it is visible to scientists, who can then correctly identify a positive test. The test is also commonly referred to as an RNA, genetic, molecular, viral detection or swab test.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?PCR tests vary in accuracy. Some can be as low as 70 percent accurate, as outlined here by Oxford University Hospitals in the UK. However, FIND (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics), tested five COVID-19 RT-PCR tests and found that all five achieved 100 percent specitivity on positive samples, and at least 96 percent specificity on negative samples.How much does it cost?Most European countries have made PCR tests available for free, though foreign nationals entering many EU countries have to pay. Travelers landing at Germany's Munich airport are being charged $213 for a PCR test.How long will it take to get my results?Between 12 and 24 hours but new technology available in some hospitals and medical practices can return results within just four hours. Similar to PCR tests, antigen tests also attempt to find out if you currently have the virus, but the process is slightly different. Rather than looking for the virus's genetic material, an antigen test looks for the presence of proteins or glycans, such as the spike proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus, via a swab sample taken from the nose and mouth.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?Antigen tests are typically very fast and cheap in many countries but are not as accurate as PCR tests, with some experts claiming they could miss 15-20 percent of infections when only small amounts of proteins or glycans are present. How much does it cost?Private UK test centers charge up to $173, while in France, they are available in pharmacies for as little as $15.How long will it take to get my results?Antigen tests are the fastest of the COVID-19 tests, with some producing results in just a few minutes.A range of COVID-19 tests are being used across Europe.

Mgahinga is also home to the endangered mountain gorillas."Golden monkeys are special in that they have an outstanding color that is nearly to the gold color, they are unique in that you can only track them from the Virunga Massif,âJoyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide at Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) told Xinhua in a recent visit to the park. UWA is a state-owned conservation agency.High up the ridges of the volcanic Mount Muhabura, which is part of Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, the golden monkeys feed on largely bamboo shoots. They live in troops of about 100, led by an Alpha male, according to UWA.Uganda has one habituated troop of about 60 golden monkeys and another group of about 80 monkeys is also being habituated as the country builds new tourist attractions.Golden monkeys are endangered species. According to UWA, tourists who come to see the mountain gorillas, which are the country's main tourist attractions, can also track the golden monkeys.Before tracking the monkeys, at the park gate, standard operating procedures like hand sanitizing, face mask-wearing and social distancing are practiced in a bid to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19 to the monkeys.About 300 meters before reaching the golden monkeys, visitors are hand sanitized again and urged to keep their face masks on. Visitors are also not allowed to get less than 10 meters away from the animals.Tourism is one of Uganda's major foreign exchange earners, bringing in about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars annually, according to ministry of finance figures.Although the sector has been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, government is optimistic that it will pick up as the country continues to ease the lockdown restrictions.Abiaz Rwamwiri, director at Africa Wild Explorations, a tour agency told Xinhua in a recent interview that once the country's international airport opens up on Oct. 1, as planned by government, tourists may start flocking in.Rwamwiri said that there are some confirmed tours scheduled for next year.Tucked on the common border with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda's Mgahinga Gorilla National Park is host to the endangered golden monkeys, a new tourist attraction.Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, which is part of the Virunga Massif is where "gold meets silver,âa tourism marketing catchphrase meaning a place where the golden monkeys coexist with the mountain gorilla silverbacks.

The football-obsessed SEC begins its season with fans in stadiums. Several teams in other leagues have had to postpone games because of outbreaks among players and staff.Institutions across the nation saw spikes of thousands of cases days after opening their doors in the last month, driven by students socializing with little or no social distancing. School and community leaders have tried to rein in the virus by closing bars, suspending students, adding mask requirements, and toggling between in-person and online instruction as case numbers rise and fall. Tension over the outbreaks is starting to boil over in college towns. Faculty members from at least two universities have held no-confidence votes in recent weeks against their top leaders, in part over reopening decisions. Government leaders want the University of Wisconsin-Madison to send its students home. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, alarmed by what he sees as draconian rules on college campuses, said he is drawing up a "bill of rights" for college students. In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, this week blamed outbreaks at two colleges for a surge of virus cases that boosted the state's infection rate high enough to put it on the list of places whose residents are required to quarantine when traveling to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The University of Wisconsin-Madison had seen more than 2,800 confirmed cases in students as of Friday. The school shut down in-person instruction for two weeks, locked down two of its largest dorms, and imposed quarantines on more than a dozen sorority and fraternity houses. The school lifted the dorm lockdown just this week. Dane County Executive Joe Parisi has demanded the university send all its students home for the rest of the academic year. "(The virus) was under control until the university came back," Parisi said. Chancellor Rebecca Blank has fired back, saying tens of thousands of students with off-campus housing would still come to the city. She accused Parisi of failing to enforce capacity restrictions in bars and off-campus parties."You can't simply wish (students) away, nor should you," Blank said in a statement directed at Parisi. Amid the fighting, thousands of students around the country have been quarantined in dorm rooms. At Kansas State University, more than 2,200 students have been placed in quarantine or isolation since class began. Student Emily Howard was isolated in what students have dubbed "COVID jail" after she and her dorm roommate tested positive for the virus on September 4, just three weeks after arriving on campus. "Now you walk around campus (and) pretty much everyone says they've had it," Howard said. "Now we don't really care as much because we know we had the antibodies." Bryan Fisher, a UW-Madison freshman quarantined in the dorms, said students were allowed to leave only to get food from the dining hall, and they were given only 30 minutes to make each trip. He said he spent his time studying and watching movies. "We were pretty much stuck in here," Fisher said. "It's been pretty hard to meet new people. Everyone's expectations of college aren't what they were." The University of Connecticut on Friday placed a third dormitory under medical quarantine. More than 150 students have tested positive. The University of Missouri has had more than 1,500 confirmed cases among students since classes began.

Schools' decisions to push on with the semester have frustrated some faculty and local community leaders. Faculty members at Appalachian State in August approved a no-confidence vote against Chancellor Sheri Everts over university finances, morale and reopening plans. Everts has said she has received support from the school's Board of Trustees. The University of Michigan faculty took a no-confidence vote against President Mark Schlissel earlier this month. Faculty felt Schlisselâs administration hasnât been transparent about reopening decisions and hasnât released any modeling gauging the health risks. Graduate students went on strike Sept. 8 to protest reopening. Schlissel has acknowledged that trust in his leadership had slipped, but the universityâs governing board expressed support him this week. "Colleges and universities are ... under immense pressure to remain open," said Chris Mariscano, director of the College Crisis Initiative, a research project at Davidson College tracking the effects of the virus on higher education. "When the president of the United States starts tweeting (about staying open), you understand just how much politics is playing a role here and institutional survival is playing a role here." University officials across the country say they hope to bolster testing and contact tracing as the semester continues. But Mariscano said universities should expect college students to act like college students. At Kansas State, Howard was not especially concerned about the virus and didn't mind the "COVID Jail," where students got free laundry service and their own bedrooms. "I personally am not too worried about it, and everyone I have talked to is not that worried about it," she said.

The football-obsessed SEC begins its season with fans in stadiums. Several teams in other leagues have had to postpone games because of outbreaks among players and staff.Institutions across the nation saw spikes of thousands of cases days after opening their doors in the last month, driven by students socializing with little or no social distancing. School and community leaders have tried to rein in the virus by closing bars, suspending students, adding mask requirements, and toggling between in-person and online instruction as case numbers rise and fall. Tension over the outbreaks is starting to boil over in college towns. Faculty members from at least two universities have held no-confidence votes in recent weeks against their top leaders, in part over reopening decisions. Government leaders want the University of Wisconsin-Madison to send its students home. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, alarmed by what he sees as draconian rules on college campuses, said he is drawing up a "bill of rights" for college students. In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, this week blamed outbreaks at two colleges for a surge of virus cases that boosted the state's infection rate high enough to put it on the list of places whose residents are required to quarantine when traveling to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The University of Wisconsin-Madison had seen more than 2,800 confirmed cases in students as of Friday. The school shut down in-person instruction for two weeks, locked down two of its largest dorms, and imposed quarantines on more than a dozen sorority and fraternity houses. The school lifted the dorm lockdown just this week. Dane County Executive Joe Parisi has demanded the university send all its students home for the rest of the academic year. "(The virus) was under control until the university came back," Parisi said. Chancellor Rebecca Blank has fired back, saying tens of thousands of students with off-campus housing would still come to the city. She accused Parisi of failing to enforce capacity restrictions in bars and off-campus parties."You can't simply wish (students) away, nor should you," Blank said in a statement directed at Parisi. Amid the fighting, thousands of students around the country have been quarantined in dorm rooms. At Kansas State University, more than 2,200 students have been placed in quarantine or isolation since class began.

Gatherings of 10 people or more will be banned between 11 p.m and 6 a.m, shops that sell food or drinks will have to close at 10 p.m and no food can be consumed at street markets. The Brussels region is experiencing one of the sharpest spikes in new infections in Belgium, averaging 323 new cases a day. BrusselsEuropean Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has become the latest top EU official to head into quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. In a tweet, she said she would be working from home and was experiencing no symptoms and felt well. Just last week, European Council President Charles Michel went into self-isolation after sharing a car ride with someone who later tested positive for the coronavirus. He exited quarantine on Friday after two negative COVID-19 tests. But the incident forced him to postpone a crucial leaders summit by a week.    Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamOn Monday night, the Dutch government will announce new measures to limit the spread of the virus in the densest regions of the country. Amsterdam (194 cases/100,000 inhabitants) and The Hague (180/100,000) are now in the Top 10 of cities with the most infections in Europe (Paris, with 231 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, tops the list). On Sunday, 2,999 people tested positive for COVID-19, a new daily record.The number of foreigners visiting the Netherlands is 70 percent lower than last year. Major events that were set in the Netherlands, Such as the Formula One Grand Prix, the Eurovision Song Contest and the UEFA Euro 2020 football tournament, were all canceled. Instead of the 21 million expected visitors, only seven million showed up. Also, 40 percent fewer Dutch people are going on holiday in their own country. This brings tourism in the Netherlands back to the level of the 1990s. Rahul Pathak in MadridIt's being reported that the socialist government of Pedro Sanchez could force the Madrid regional government to implement stricter coronavirus measures.  Right now 45 neighbourhoods in and around Madrid are under some form of lockdown, but the national government wants that extended to the entire city, which has the worst infection rate in Europe.  So far the right wing coalition government of Isabel Ayuso is resisting any further restrictions prompting the central government to say that it is prepared to intervene if there is "an urgent need." Isobel Ewing in BudapestPrime Minister Viktor Orban has assured Hungarians that the country will procure a vaccine against the coronavirus and it will be made available to everyone who needs it.Speaking on commercial broadcaster TV2, Orban said: "Brussels estimates the vaccine will be ready by 2021, while the Americans expect it to be ready by the end of the year".He added: "We'll be free from this misery and we will endure it until then."Orban said the coronavirus pandemic is worsening in Hungary and the situation is difficult, with a lot of pressure on health and education both now and in the coming months. However, he believes that as the winter months approach, people will be more inclined to abide by hygiene rules.Andrew Wilson in LondonThe government is expected to enforce a total social lockdown on large parts of the country today, including London. Pubs and restaurants could be ordered to close for two weeks and households banned from meeting each other.As of today, people face a heavy fine if they do not self-isolate after a positive test or are told to quarantine by test-and-trace services. Household members should also self-isolate by law.The police are expected to start carrying out spot checks in areas where there are high levels of the virus.Thousands of university students remain in self-isolation in their halls of residence. Ministers say any complaints about fees should be directed at the institutions, not the government. Ross Cullen in ParisIn France, the latest measures came into force overnight on Sunday into Monday, including the closure of all bars and restaurants in Marseille, Aix-en-Provence and Guadeloupe. In Paris, sports centers and gyms have closed and bars in the capital now must close at 10 p.m. These measures will be in place for at least two weeks. The moves come as a new poll in the Journal de Dimanche Sunday newspaper shows that 72 percent of French citizens are in favor of new nationwide lockdown for at least 15 days. In the same survey, it showed that only 44 percent of those polled said they trusted the government to help businesses recover. On Monday, finance minister Bruno Le Maire will present the budget for next year. The 2021 finance bill sets out the main lines of the $116 billion stimulus plan and the government says its forecasts have anticipated a possible deterioration in economic health. FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: WHO backs China's emergency use of COVID-19 vaccinesCGTN America: Is New York dead?

Many online platforms are believed to be using this information to manipulate the prices we pay for the products and services we frequently use so that we end up paying more than others. The Chinese government has said such activities must stop. With China's National Day Golden Week starting on October 1, the directive could not be more timely. The pandemic is largely under control across the country, and millions of people will be capitalizing on the easing measures to get away for a few days.Online bookings are the preferred choice, but it seems the more you use certain platforms, the more susceptible you are to higher prices. "Some platforms have a huge mass of people's personal information, and use artificial intelligence algorithms to personalize prices for these people. Then price discrimination may occur," said Zhi Zhenfeng, a research fellow at the Institute of Law at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "It is likely a violation of consumer rights laws," Zhi said. "Although there are many laws protecting personal information, there is no specific law in this regard. This gives some fraudulent sellers the opportunity to personalize prices." The government has identified this problem and has issued temporary regulations. They stipulate that online travel agencies should obtain the consent of users before collecting their personal information.Users should know what's being recorded, why it's being recorded and how it will be used. Meanwhile, online travel agencies are told not to use people's information to personalize or bump-up prices."The new regulation could protect consumers' rights and interests by defining the responsibilities of the online travel agencies," said Zhi. "It will improve the environment of consumers to a certain extent." However, the problem isn't exclusive to travel. It also happens when customers purchase goods online or even order food. Once these platforms understand your preferences through big data, they can manipulate the price you have to pay.So what can consumers do to avoid paying more?"When consumers register on these online platforms, they should pay close attention to the information they're being asked for," Zhi said. "They should make sure what kind of authorization the platform would get. If the platform requires excessive information, for example, a lot of personal information, then consumers should file a complaint if they can't refuse."Zhi also warned about the information that gets collected when companies give away gifts and discounts. "It's better to refrain from small gains online, such as swiping a QR code or clicking an electronic gift," Zhi said. "Sometimes you are required to fill in some personal information, which is likely leaked to the third party."Our online data contain a great deal of information about our personal lives.

As the eight-day National Day holiday fast approaches, the annual ecological tourism festival featuring Populus euphratica is scheduled to open in Ejin during the Golden Week.Populus euphratica, also known as desert poplar, is a rare species that can survive in extremely dry and cold regions, commonly found in temperate deserts in China's western part. Sitting in the Gobi Desert, Ejin is home to one of the largest Populus euphratica forests in the country â nearly 30,000 hectares.Over the years, by putting the rich resources of poplar desert forests into good use, Ejin has made various efforts in developing the tourism industry while preserving the rare species. The thriving tourism businesses have boosted the local economy and helped those once impoverished households escape extreme poverty.Ejin has built several tourist attractions, among which the Populus Euphratica Forest Tourist Area has now become one of the must-visit spots in autumn for outings and photographs and also a landmark in Ejin.The booming tourism sector has then tempted more local farmers and herdsmen to join the cooperative to run various tourism-related businesses, such as opening homestay inns, offering horse-riding, camel-riding, as well as off-riding vehicle rental services at the scenic spot.As of the end of 2019, 63 registered poor households (146 people) in Ejin were able to witness a surge in their earnings through working in the tourism industry. Statistics from the local government showed that their average annual income saw an increase of 13,637 yuan (2,000 U.S. dollars) per household compared with the previous year.Acknowledging the significant role that the ecological environment has played in Ejin's tourism development, local people started to make efforts in ecological construction and preservation. In 2018, China Green Foundation, a non-governmental organization, launched a "Euphrates poplar project" in Inner Mongolia in a bid to fight desertification. Also, in this June, the local government launched a set of regulations on protecting the desert poplar forests in Ejin.Read more: Inner Mongolia's rejuvenating desert poplar forestsLast year from January to November, Ejin received a total of 8 million domestic and foreign tourists, a year-on-year increase of 15 percent, with the overall tourism revenue exceeding 7.6 billion yuan (1.1 billion U.S. dollars), according to Du Zigang, deputy director of the local culture and tourism bureau.

Holding carnival - whether it's samba schools or 'blocos,' any kind of carnival with crowds of people - without certainty on a vaccine or guarantees for people's health is a mistake," said Rita Fernandes, president of the Sebastiana association."Sebastiana has decided that without a vaccine and especially without health guarantees for the population, we're not going to hold any kind of carnival at all," she told TV network Globo News.Rio's carnival, the world's biggest, draws millions of tourists from around Brazil and the world each year.But it has become the latest casualty of the pandemic, as Brazil struggles to get a handle on the second-deadliest outbreak of COVID-19 in the world, after the United States.Brazil has registered 4.7 million infections and nearly 140,000 deaths from the virus.And while its spread has slowed somewhat since July, the numbers are still alarmingly high, with an average of nearly 30,000 new cases and 735 new deaths per day over the past two weeks, according to health ministry figures.Rio is the Brazilian city hit second-hardest, after economic capital Sao Paulo, with 10,730 deaths.This is the first time it has postponed carnival since 1912.The pandemic had already forced Rio to scrap another tourist magnet, its annual New Year's Eve celebrations on Copacabana beach.The city's economy will likely take a hit from both decisions. Last year, carnival brought 1.5 million tourists to Rio and added 3.8 billion reais (685 million U.S. dollars) to the economy.But many residents said they supported the move."I'm a huge fan of carnival - I go to the 'blocos,' I dance in a samba school. But right now we need to be protecting people, especially the elderly," Carla Mauro, a 52-year-old architect, said on Copacabana."A year with no carnival won't kill anyone."(Cover: Queen of Percussion Raissa Machado of Unidos do Viradouro Samba School performs during the 2020 Rio de Janeiro Carnival champions' parade at the Sapucai Sambadrome on February 29, 2020 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. /CFP)Revelers hoping to escape the coronavirus doldrums at Rio de Janeiro's world-famous carnival got more bad news Friday as organizers indefinitely postponed the city's epic street parties, a day after the official parades were scrapped.Originally scheduled for February 2021, the Brazilian beach city's carnival is a massive mixture of social-distancing no-no's, from the huge crowds that attend the annual samba school parade competition to the giant free-for-all of street parties known as "blocos."After organizers announced Thursday they were indefinitely postponing the samba school parades because of the pandemic, the association responsible for 11 of the biggest "blocos" said it was following suit."The samba school league made the absolutely correct decision.

It drew travelers and traders from far and wide, all with different perspectives on life and eager to learn from others. It was known to be a place where a belief system could truly thrive.  The centuries seem to have passed by in a flash here. Yet, the long passage of time could not totally bury history.  There are ruins of Subash Temple north of the city of Kuqa in southern Xinjiang, highlighting the dominance of the Buddhist religion in these parts."Buddhism came to Qiuci around the 2nd century," illustrated Miao Lihui, chief researcher at Kucha Academy of Xinjiang. "Construction began on Subash in the following century. It was supposed to be the largest temple here. It flourished until the 12th century." "From here, we can see traces of the time when Indian Buddhism was introduced into China, and Chinese Buddhism later spread westward," Miao said. These traces have gone down in history and the evidence is still quite vague.  However, there are stronger claims in the Kizil Buddhist cave temples in neighboring Baicheng County. Miao Lihui has been doing research here for two decades. "The theme of these paintings is closely related to Sakyamuni, and so are the stories. The tales are about Buddha's previous lives and journey in this life. On this dome, there's a painting of the Buddha's life as Prince Sudana is sacrificing his own life to save a family of tigers," Miao explained as he showed us into a cave. These paintings are said to encourage kindness and good deeds. It was actually from Qiuci where Buddhism was introduced to central China.  Qiuci's prince Kumarajiva traveled eastward and translated numerous Buddhist scriptures into the ancient Chinese language in Chang'an, today's Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, until he passed away.  "We see these temples, grottoes and the Buddhists who once lived here and brought Buddhism to Qiuci. Through this, they were able to bridge cultural exchanges between the east and the west and promote world cultural prosperity and development," Miao said. Though in the past centuries, many were stolen and brought to other parts of the world, those that remain are well-preserved and listed as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. They are our window into a time when Buddhism truly flourished in Xinjiang. Over time, Buddhism gradually disappeared from Qiuci, now known as Kuqa. But its legacy remains. It will not quietly turn to ashes and dust, but rather be remembered for generations to come.  Kuqa, a bustling township at the center of the ancient state of Qiuci, used to be a hub for business, culture and thoughts along the ancient Silk Road.

Designers from across the nation have brought their latest ideas to inspire Beijing visitors. Modern design ideas refresh various articles for everyday use, like furniture, costumes, and decorations. How to transmit the country's rich cultural heritage has been a subject much discussed among artists and craftsmen in recent years. Many believe merging ancient with modern in fashion for mass production is the best way. "The Chinese tiger pillow is a mascot inherited from ancient China. It has been considered a symbol of protection of its owner and was commonly used as pillows or sachets. Artist Sanmao uses it in jewelry making. Small and delicate, it's more popular nowadays," said Wu Xu, curator of the traditional products section of the Beijing Design Expo.Drinking tea in nature might be one of the Chinese people's ideals of a perfect moment, and this has inspired artist Akuang in the creation of his space. He uses 999 embroidery frames of different sizes to connect African grass, Hainan horsetail grass, and pine needles, allowing the viewer to see the changing colors of the plants and feel the vitality of nature.Akuang's idea is echoed by Zhao Sumin, whose company grows around 1,500 different kinds of plants. Designing small garden-like spaces is their new business direction, and turns out to be very popular."We hope that every individual can get access to plants in their living space, including home and office. Many people, especially in big cities like Beijing, live under various pressures nowadays. Being in a natural environment is better for our physical and psychological health," said Zhao, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Garden Scape Co.

This number, he said, was 2.6 times higher than the one before the COVID-19 outbreak. These flights have been strengthening the bonds amid the pandemic, he added.The first direct international flight to land in Beijing following the lifting of COVID-19 curbs was that of Air China (CA746). Departing from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, the plane landed at the Beijing Capital International Airport on September 3, signifying the resumption of direct international flights.Resumption of flights in China offers a glimmer of hope for the aviation industry globally. However, travel norms for passengers, especially when it comes to air travel, have changed in ways that were previously unimaginable.New guidelines for air travel As the restrictions are eased, an increasing number of people are choosing air travel to commute domestically. Naturally, airports are not how they used to be.Passengers need to wear masks covering their nose and mouth, and there are signs reminding them to do so everywhere at the airports. Additionally, it is essential to practice social distancing, staying at least 6 feet apart, especially when waiting in line."Most viruses and germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes," according to travel guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Some airline companies have canceled their in-flight meals to decrease touch points onboard, while others are providing passengers with pre-packaged meals only. For example, Delta announced that "customers in all cabins will now receive their own personal snack bags on domestic flights," which include crackers and cookies. Body temperature checks are becoming part of the new airline boarding process, as a fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19, according to CDC and other medical institutions.  A health QR code or health declaration form has become a travel necessity in China after the coronavirus outbreak. Filling in the health code information before landing could save one more time. It's important to check the policies of the destination cities or countries for information, as some regions will require a nucleic acid test for COVID-19 before entry. The number of passengers globally will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024, according to International Air Transport Association.

Since the initial launch of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, this railway has become the most popular and convenient way to connect Tibet to the rest of China, bringing tremendous profits to the regions.Dubbed the "sky road" and noted as a man-made wonder in transportation, the 1,956-kilometer-long world-renowned railway begins in Xining and ends in Lhasa. The stunning scenery along the railway offers not only a feast for the eyes, but also a journey for the soul. Come join CGTN to enjoy the enchanting trip on the Qinghai-Tibet train! Qinghai Lake: A paradise for birdwatchers and cyclistsStarting from Xining Railway Station, it takes around one hour to appreciate the stunning view of Qinghai Lake. Dazzling like a crystal-clear gem, Qinghai Lake is the largest inland lake as well as saline lake in China. Surrounded by lofty mountains, the lake features two sub-lakes: a saline Gahai Lake and a freshwater Erhai Lake. Be it the blue sky and water, the green grassland or mesmerizing landscapes â Qinghai Lake boasts great charms worth exploring.Qinghai Lake is definitely a paradise for bird lovers as many different kinds of birds would fly here to breed in May and June due to the mild weather. Meanwhile, for cyclists, cycling around the lake not only allows them to enjoy the beauty of the lake view, but also while away the time.Tips: The best time to visit the Qinghai Lake is from April to August as numerous Cole flowers blossom along the lake during that time, forming breathtaking scenery for visitors. In addition, May and June are the best season for bird watching.Kunlun Mountains: More than just mountainsAs the train keeps moving up, a picturesque view of the Kunlun Mountains appears before you. Reputed as the holy mountains, the Kunlun extend west from the Pamirs with a length of 2,500 kilometers. The 6,178-meter-high Yuzhu Peak is the highest of the Kunlun Mountains in Qinghai. The high peaks are covered with snow and mist all year round, creating a stunning view along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It's worth mentioning that Yuzhu Peak is the first sightseeing station for passengers, which allows them to get off the train and take photos outside. It is considered to be an ideal choice for hiking beginners as its route requires less technique.Hoh Xil Nature Reserve: 'Forbidden zone for humans'Hoh Xil, which means "green mountains" in Mongolian, is a plateau between the Kunlun and Tanggula mountain ranges, with an average altitude of 5,000 meters. Home to many wild animals, including the Tibetan antelope and the wild yak, Hoh Xil Nature Reserve is undoubtedly a desolate region in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The extensive area of alpine mountains and steppe systems is situated more than 4,500 meters above sea level, where sub-zero average temperatures prevail all year round. The geographic and harsh climatic conditions have made this place a "forbidden zone for humans," which is also a reason for its biodiversity. This is probably one of the few places left on Earth where one could get off the beaten track and find inner peace.  Tips:  As there are no signs in Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, visitors often get lost here. Remember to bring a local guide with you or rent a car to travel. Tsonag Lake: A 'soul lake' for TibetansLying in Amdo County, Nagqu Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tsonag Lake is one of the most significant holy lakes to local residents.  The Qinghai-Tibet railway passes right by the lake, making it the closest altiplano lake to the railway on the road. Passengers can take photos and capture the charming view of the lake as they would definitely have something to brag about on social media.Lhasa: The start of the journey to TibetThe final destination of the Qinghai-Tibet train trip â Lhasa, offers almost every aspect of Tibetan culture. If one must pick a name card for Lhasa, the Potala Palace is very likely to be the answer. No one can really say that he/she has visited Lhasa unless they have been to the Potala Palace â a must-see for travelers from home and abroad. Tibet is always full of incredible scenery. In early March when most of the plateau is still tinged with a wintry chill, Nyingchi Prefecture, in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, is blanketed with pink blossoms. If you want to record all the scenery along the sky road, seeing them yourself is not enough. The feelings from the bottom of your heart are important. So, what are you still waiting for? It's time to pack your bag and start the soul journey to Tibet where you could completely hand over yourself to nature and experience the unique Tibetan culture.  For centuries, Tibet has not been explored as much by the outside world due to its remote location, extreme climate and geographic environment.

At a themed forum on Thursday, big names from the country's streaming services gathered to discuss how to produce documentaries that appeal to Generation Z.   When it comes to documentaries, many people think of educational films or series that are too dry to keep viewers' attention.  However for streaming services like Bilibili, Youku and iQiyi, documentaries are the best way to win over viewers, especially the younger ones, if you know what really speaks to them.  As part of the themed forum at this year's Beijing Documentary Week, representatives from these companies have come to share their stories at the China Millennium Monument Museum.  Bilibili, which started as ACG video platform, has a track record of success with younger generations like Gen Z in distributing documentaries in recent years.  Previous hit series on the platform include "The Story of CHUAN'ER" the popular grilled kebabs, which has been viewed over 200 million times through the first two seasons.  Zhu Xiangliang, senior adviser at the Documentary Department of Bilibili, told CGTN, "The documentaries distributed via new media platforms offer more interaction between the audience and the production team than ever before. For example, some viewers would make stickers or render clips of our documentaries in new ways, and these would bring more attention to the series. It's a positive succession."Zhu revealed that young viewers are equally attracted to themes like history and traditional crafts, contrary to conventional thinking.  A good example is Bilibili's two-season documentary which has taken a different angle on historic figures, like bringing the gourmet side of poet Su Shi. And technology also helps to bring a fresh perspective and a modern approach to documentaries. Zhang Wei, director of Youku Documentary Center, explained, "Creative storytelling methods like what we did with The Legend Hunters can give documentaries a new look to hook the younger generation. Mini mobile games are mixed into The Legend Hunters as a way to explain archaeological methodology and the science relevant to this site. In the near future we might see more interactive documentaries or even ones specifically designed for vertical screens." Beijing Documentary Week will also see the release of quality documentaries and themed screenings.  It runs till Tuesday, September 22. The fourth edition of Beijing Documentary Week which kicked off Tuesday is in full swing, bringing 54 selected documentaries and a series of exhibitions, seminars and cultural events to the capital.

And it's been practiced by some of the greats in European art. From German Renaissance figure DÃ¼rer to French impressionist Monet and even modernists Picasso and Matisse. The origins of copperplate etching can be traced back to Medieval Europe. An image is drawn on a copperplate then transferred onto paper using a printing press. The traditional method has evolved over centuries into an art form in its own right.Yang Hui, curator of Changyang Art Museum, said: "These copperplate prints are small and delicate. They are quite different from Chinese paintings, which are grand and magnificent. This exhibit gives people here in Beijing a chance to closely feel the charm of European art." Copper-plate etching arrived in China during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) by way of European missionaries and gained popularity during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), winning the emperor's favor in Emperor Qianlong's reign. Today, copperplate etching has become a form of cultural exchange between China and France. Guo Renzhi, a Beijing resident viewed the exhibition, said, "I'm in awe. The pieces are very detailed. The themes are colorful, even the ones on human figures and landscapes. The depictions are meticulous. When you look carefully, you'll see they're so vivid. Even if it's in black and white, you can still see how the brightness changes." The exhibit runs through October. An exhibition of French copperplate etching is underway in the Chinese capital, featuring collections from Li Keran Academy of Painting.  Over 200 copperplate prints on show from the Palace of Versailles use a technique that has a history of nearly 600 years and requires a certain degree of skill.

France, however, was still in a tough battle against the epidemic at that time. Both countries have overcome many difficulties to hold the exhibition, she added.At the exhibition is an innovative, immersive space that allows visitors to explore the origin and background stories about "Impression, Sunrise" via video clips and projections.It also holds a crossover collaboration with Team Wang, a home-grown streetwear label by Chinese pop star Jackson Wang, featuring a conceptual display space, "TEAM WANGÃMONET," on the third floor of the Bund One Art Museum, where the famous painting embraces a new interpretation and incorporates the images of landmarks in Shanghai and Paris like the Oriental Pearl Tower and Eiffel Tower.One of the greatest painters of the 20th century, Monet is a founder of French Impressionist painting and an unswerving advocate of the Impressionist style. His masterwork "Impression, Sunrise," which was created from a scene in the port of northwestern French city Le Havre, is credited with inspiring the name of the Impressionist movement.The exhibition will run through January 3, 2021.(Cover: A poster for the Claude Monet exhibition at the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai, China. /ambafrance.org)Groundbreaking artwork "Impression, Sunrise" by legendary French painter Claude Monet (1840-1926) made its China debut nearly 150 years after it was first shown at a Paris exhibition, stunning the world of art.Monet's 1872 masterpiece was unveiled on Wednesday at the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai, while a special exhibition in honor of the French impressionist painter takes place from Thursday, September 17, where Chinese viewers can have a close look at some of Monet's classics.In addition to the world-famed "Impression, Sunrise," the exhibition is showcasing a total of 47 French paintings, including nine of Monet's masterworks collected in the Marmottan Monet Museum in Paris, such as "Charing Cross Bridge, Smoke in the Fog" (1902) and "Sailing Boat, Evening Effect" (1885).The sunrise symbolizes new birth and hope, which seems more meaningful than ever since people are facing the COVID-19 pandemic, said Marianne Mathieu, the Marmottan's curatorial director.Myriam Kryger, cultural attache of the French consulate general in Shanghai, said the idea to exhibit "Impression, Sunrise" in China started around April as prevention and control measures in China began producing positive results.

That is the traditional culture of the Yi people," said Fan Chengyuan, head of Xianrendong, a village tucked away in southwest China's Yunnan Province.Xianrendong, which means "fairy cave" in Chinese, was plagued by extreme poverty for a very long time. In the 1990s, it was nicknamed the "Pocket Village" because of people's dire living conditions. Villagers largely relied on growing crops and fishing for a living and their average annual income was only 300 yuan (44 U.S. dollars) â approximately one-eighth of the national poverty line which is 2,300 yuan (339 U.S. dollars).Things have changed since. In 2019, per capita income jumped to 40,000 yuan (5,902 U.S. dollars) on average, making the village the richest in Qiubei County.Developing rural tourism with ethnic elementsThe nearby scenic spot of Puzhehei first started developing its tourism sector in the 1990s. As changes began to set in, people in the surrounding villages slowly started to see tourism as a viable method for escaping poverty as well.Home to 196 households, Xianrendong is inhabited by Yi people â one of the largest ethnic minority groups in China. It also boasts clear lakes and lush vegetation, offering abundant tourism resources.Seeing the potential business opportunity, Fan quit his previous job in the county and returned to the village in 2005. He then took out a bank loan to renovate old houses and convert them into homestay properties with traditional ethnic Yi style.Keeping local traditions and ethnic culture alive has become key to the village's tourism development. Fan said they studied the traditional architectural styles and upgraded the designs to make the houses more habitable and comfortable. Since 2013, yellow-brick cottages of two or three stories have sprung up across the village. They also revived traditional customs and events, ethnic handicrafts as well as folk songs and dances. During special occasions, the resident art troupe would stage singing and dancing performances around the bonfire, presenting a cultural feast for the visitors. This return to traditional culture has successfully brought a boon to the once impoverished village.As the village rose to fame and popularity, more job opportunities followed, covering the industries of agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, catering, accommodation and others. Today, many young people have returned home to start their own businesses.Last year, 5.85 million trips by domestic and foreign visitors were made to the Puzhehei scenic spot, bringing in 5.25 billion yuan (775 million U.S. dollars) in tourism revenue.(Cover image designed by Du Chenxin)"The development of rural tourism cannot come at the expense of [a place's] essence. That is the traditional culture of the Yi people," said Fan Chengyuan, head of Xianrendong, a village tucked away in southwest China's Yunnan Province.Xianrendong, which means "fairy cave" in Chinese, was plagued by extreme poverty for a very long time. In the 1990s, it was nicknamed the "Pocket Village" because of people's dire living conditions. Villagers largely relied on growing crops and fishing for a living and their average annual income was only 300 yuan (44 U.S. dollars) â approximately one-eighth of the national poverty line which is 2,300 yuan (339 U.S. dollars).Things have changed since. In 2019, per capita income jumped to 40,000 yuan (5,902 U.S. dollars) on average, making the village the richest in Qiubei County.Developing rural tourism with ethnic elementsThe nearby scenic spot of Puzhehei first started developing its tourism sector in the 1990s. As changes began to set in, people in the surrounding villages slowly started to see tourism as a viable method for escaping poverty as well.Home to 196 households, Xianrendong is inhabited by Yi people â one of the largest ethnic minority groups in China. It also boasts clear lakes and lush vegetation, offering abundant tourism resources.Seeing the potential business opportunity, Fan quit his previous job in the county and returned to the village in 2005. He then took out a bank loan to renovate old houses and convert them into homestay properties with traditional ethnic Yi style.Keeping local traditions and ethnic culture alive has become key to the village's tourism development. Fan said they studied the traditional architectural styles and upgraded the designs to make the houses more habitable and comfortable. Since 2013, yellow-brick cottages of two or three stories have sprung up across the village. They also revived traditional customs and events, ethnic handicrafts as well as folk songs and dances.

The group acquired the brand and online assets of the UK company last November and for the relaunch of the new company it will retain the brand's familiar "Sunny Heart" logo.  In a statement, the new Thomas Cook said it was "COVID-19 ready," and will initially sell holidays to destinations on the UK government's safe travel corridor list including Italy, Greece and Turkey via its new website.Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 and was the world's oldest travel firm until it went bankrupt in September 2019, six months before the COVID-19 pandemic caused chaos for the travel industry. â¢ Fauchon fermÃ©?

Now, with more exhibits dusting display cases and opening their doors again, a trip to the museum comes with mandatory mask-wearing and body temperature checks, hand sanitizer stations, social distancing markers and limits on visitor numbers. In the spirit of adapting to the new normal, museums have turned to the virtual space and museum patrons have warmed up to appreciating artwork from the comfort of their living room.This month, 16 museum curators from around the world sifted through their collections to choose their most favorite relics and shared them with a global audience in a nine-day art galore, which also featured discussions about the most pressing issues facing museums during these extraordinary times.The "Treasure Hunt Relay: Global Museum Director's Choice," which ran from September 6 to 15, was an initiative by The National Museum of China to help art lovers experience the power of culture wherever they were. The museum collaborated with 15 other cultural institutions across five continents to display prized artifacts and share the exciting history behind them, while weighing in on the opportunities and obstacles brought about by COVID-19.Every day, two curators held online presentations, revealing some of the cultural objects closest to their hearts. The relay began with the Beijing-based host museum and ended with the British Museum on Monday.About 90 percent of the museums worldwide were forced to temporarily shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak, and 13 percent could have their doors permanently closed, according to a May report jointly released by the UNESCO and International Council of Museums.The National Museum of China, for example, closed for 100 days before reopening on May 1, and currently caps the number of daily visitors at 8,000.In countries that rely heavily on tourism, the impact is even bigger. The number of visitors to the National Museum of Slovenia is now about 25 percent of that of last year. The Singapore-based Asian Civilizations Museum, which normally sees an average of 2,000 guests a day, is registering just 5 percent of the usual flow after reopening in June.The internet provided a way out for museums, which moved their exhibits and activities online in search of viable alternatives, with technology playing an important role in the conceptualization of fresh projects.The National Museum of China launched dozens of virtual exhibitions, including the first virtual exhibition on Chinese aerospace achievements, and a number of digital courses. The National Museum in Warsaw launched an app called Selfie, which allowed people to take pictures of their favorite works of art and upload them online. Meanwhile, the National Museum of Korea modified existing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) projects and moved them online."These opportunities also get the public to tell us how they were experiencing the pandemic. These things in their own right will become important documents telling the story of how people coped with this age," said Dr. Mathew Trinca, curator of the National Museum of Australia.As palaces for sheltering human civilization, connecting the past, present and future, "museums are important at this time because they sustain our people and give them a sense of hope and optimism, drawn from the study of experiences of people in the past," said Trinca."I think this is important for us now to know how human beings are resilient and [how] we've overcome obstacles like these in our shared long history on earth," he added.Marriage of cultures"Virtual space, cloud exhibition and live broadcast can reach beyond the limits of time and space, so that audiences from all over the world can understand our museums, enjoy the exquisite collections of the museums, and appreciate the brilliance and splendor of different civilizations," said Dr. Wang Chunfa, curator of the National Museum of China, during the relay's opening presentation.The rich collections of the U.S.-based Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art is an example of the convergence of cultures. Dr. Chase F. Robinson, the curator, introduced two Chinese relics, the Square Ritual Food Cauldron (Fangding) from the 3,000-year-old Western Zhou period and the scroll "Nymph of the Luohe River" traditionally attributed to Chinese painter Gu Kaizhi who lived some 1,600 years ago."Just like the Silk Road connected East Asia with the near east of the Mediterranean world, we now live in a world in which we can recreate the Silk Road with some optical fibers. So optical fibers are now connecting East and West," said Robinson when referring to the "Treasure Hunt Relay" project.The National Museum of the Sultanate of Oman also shared their appreciation to the Chinese culture, showing three Ming-Dynasty bowls, which attests to the long-lasting relationship and sea trade on the maritime Silk Road that connected Oman and China."Today we are witnessing the idea of a global world coming under increased reassessment, criticism, and scrutiny. We see nationalism become stronger again and perhaps a certain tendency of countries isolating themselves from others. I believe strongly that this movement, which comes way out of the past of an ever-growing connection globally, is irreversible," said Dr. Hartwig Fischer, curator of the British Museum.Fischer said that the possibility of working with the National Museum of China is a huge chance with an impact on the development of globalization.

Some of the exhibits have been displayed for the first time.Since its completion in 1420, the Forbidden City served as the imperial palace of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) Dynasties, with 24 emperors living and ruling there. It stands today as the concentrated embodiment of thought about urban planning and palace construction in ancient China.Exhibition explores the Forbidden City's past 600 yearsFollowing the timeline, the exhibition has been divided into three parts with 18 major historical events. The first part explains why the Forbidden City was planned and laid out as it is through the relationship between the imperial palace and the capital city.The second part, "Inclusiveness," focuses on the Forbidden City's look in ethnic elements after it was taken over by ethnic Manchu ruler during the Qing Dynasty and Western architectural style after the 18th century.The third part shows how the imperial palace was given new vitality after becoming a public museum and World Heritage Site and welcoming visitors both from home and abroad."The Forbidden City has a cultural foundation of several thousands of years, and architectural basis on the traditions of the Tang and Song Dynasties before evolving into its today's form," said Ren Wanping, deputy director of the Palace Museum and the general curator of the exhibition."I hope visitors perceive that the Forbidden City contains Chinese philosophical thought and humanistic spirit from our ceaseless culture passed down from generation to generation," she added.Rarely-seen cultural relics exhibitedThe exhibition displays many rarely-seen cultural relics, including the Empress's Winter Court Coronet used on her wedding day and the Jewel-inlaid Gold Cup with "Jin'ou youngu" (Everlasting Territory) Inscription used by the emperor on Chinese New Year's Eve.The ten Glazed Animal Ornaments, which stand together only on the eaves of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the largest and highest-level building in the Forbidden City, have been displayed together for the first time. On previous occasions, they were shown separately.Another treasure is the Lacquered Gauze, originally on the window partition in the south room of the Belvedere of Viewing Achievements (Fuwang ge). Painted with gold and silver, the exquisite fabric has six layers but it is easy for light to get through."This is the first time it is displayed for the public in the past over 200 years," said curator Zhang Jie, "Because of its fragile condition, it will be very hard for it to exhibit again in the future."The exhibition will last till November 15.(Cover image designer: Yin Yating)The Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, on Thursday inaugurated an exhibition featuring its planning, layout, architecture and court life to celebrate its 600th birthday.Titled "Everlasting splendor: Six centuries at the Forbidden City," the exhibition displays more than 450 cultural relics and historical photos in three halls on top of the Meridian Gate, or the Forbidden City's main entrance.

The Palace Gate site, the largest and most ornate entrance into the complex, is also being excavated and restored since 2019.Read more: Old Summer Palace gate area being restoredWith more and more relics unearthed and returned to the palace, the administration has again submitted an application to the relevant authorities, hoping to push forward the construction of the museum, CCTV News reported.The park is located near China's two most prestigious universities â Tsinghua University and Peking University â as well as Zhongguancun, known as "China's Silicon Valley."

They have special visas that allow them to stay for 90 days with the option to renew twice. The first 14 days have to be spent in quarantine.Among other stipulations, they also need to have proof of travel insurance and medical insurance for in and outpatient treatment, as well as for treatment for COVID-19.After landing, their papers were checked, and their temperatures were taken before they were allowed through immigration. In all, they had to pass through three thermoscans as they walked through the airport, according to airport authorities. As they queued to board buses, workers in protective clothing disinfected their luggage."We can assure everyone that all our measures are systematic and meet international standards," said the airport's deputy general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn.Chinese tourists were seen putting on raincoats as the last step before leaving for their quarantine accommodation. Kittipong said this was not a government requirement, but rather, he said, the raincoats appeared to have been part of a complimentary package of items from their hotel.Almost 40 million people visited Thailand in 2019, with tourism accounting for more than 10 percent of the country's GDP. But the halting of international flights in early April, due to the pandemic, has left the sector in dire straits. Well-known tourist spots, used to hordes of visitors, are now almost empty, as are the country's famous sandy beaches.More flights are scheduled for tourists on special visas in the coming weeks.(Cover: Chinese tourists from Shanghai arrive at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, October 20, 2020. /AP)Si Qiang, literally "four tunes," is a form of folk music that reflect the social and romantic activities of the young men and women from the Yi ethnic group, which is spread across Eshan Yi Autonomous County, southwest China's Yunnan Province.As a vital part of Yi folk music, it was included in the Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection List of Yunnan Province in 2013.As the name suggests, Si Qiang have four singing tunes, which are distinctive but can be repeated in the same song.

But such requirements have drawn criticism from a minority that has complained of having their liberty suppressed."In those situations where a customer declines to wear a face covering, we'll put in place additional procedures to take care of them in a friendly, expedited way," McDonald's said, adding that it will help its employees get training "to ensure they are prepared to address this new policy in a friendly and positive way."Customers who come into a McDonald's restaurant without a mask will be offered one by a worker, a McDonald's representative told NPR. If they refuse to wear it, they'll be asked to stand at "a designated pick-up spot a safe distance from other customers," where they'll receive their orders.McDonald's is the latest U.S. corporate giant to issue mask mandates for its customers, following major restaurant chains and retailers that have announced similar policies, including Starbucks, Panera Bread, Walmart, and Kroger.Earlier this month, Starbucks and Panera Bread became some of the first large national restaurant chains to require face masks.The U.S. now has more than four million confirmed coronavirus cases.

Baijiu is a Chinese spirit with a huge and loyal fan base, but I've heard all sorts of hyperbolic commentary about the high alcohol content and pungent taste.To try it out for myself, I wander through Beijing's hutongs (alleys formed by the city's traditional courtyard homes) and discover a baijiu bar tucked away in an artsy, up-and-coming neighborhood. I order a flight of baijiu shots and get an introduction to what baijiu is all about: sharp, bitter, and very strong, in my opinion. Let's just say it's probably not for the faint of heart. At this particular bar though, baijiu also comes in the form of cocktails featuring different juices, syrups, and bitters. Now we're talking!

The government is bringing in the measure to counter the rising number of infections as France battles a second wave of the coronavirus. The curfew will be in place for at least a month and the police will be carrying out checks with the powers to impose fines of 135 euros ($158) for breaking it. This is by far the strictest measure to be announced since the spring lockdown to control the first wave, which ended in mid-May. Macron, who was being interviewed by two leading TV anchors, urged families to try to limit the number of people meeting in private but did say that travel around the country will not be affected and people can still take their half-term holidays. The president said: "We are a nation of united citizens.

The chancellor also warned more measures will be put in place in the coming days, such as stricter travel restrictions.  Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamPrime Minister Mark Rutte admitted his government made mistakes in managing the coronavirus crisis.

Images of people partying in The Hague caused a stir in parliament. Social media showed people singing and dancing in a crowded party tent in the city center.

Since Wednesday at 10 p.m., all restaurants, bars and cafes have been closed for at least four weeks. Take-away and delivery are still allowed.Unemployment in The Netherlands decreased for the first time since the start of the pandemic.

An exhibition in Beijing unravels its mystery and history.These are eye-witnesses of the evolution of Chinese civilization from the third to the ninth century. Rather than curated by chronology or geography, the 200 or so ceramic objects are arranged into four subjects: Anchoret, Sutra, Alchemy and Lions. Each concept represents a significant cultural, social or historical aspect of the period."Anchoret" refers to powerful and influential families who had for generations held important official positions in the Wei, Jin and Northern and Southern dynasties. At the beginning of the third century, the scholar-officer clan, who failed in its pursuit of the official career, grew skeptical of Confucian ethics. "They began pursuing a more philosophical, seclusive way of living, advocating for individual liberation and spiritual freedom. This, in turn, greatly changed how ceramics artifacts were produced and appreciated," said Lei Wanwan, founder of the M WOODS Art Museum.Another important section titled "Sutra" features Buddhism. China experienced deep political and social turmoil from the third to the sixth century. Religion was a great relief for people who suffered in life. As a result, Buddhist images were highly recognized in ceramic art during this period.In ancient times, most ceramic objects served as tools of production, daily utensils or funeral items. They were not endowed with aesthetic values like they are today. But this gradually changed as techniques developed. The Ling Long bowl is a good example.The kiln men carved small holes in porcelain. After firing it to form a shape, they glazed the whole body and put it into the kiln. The glazes flowed through the kiln and covered the holes. When light gets through, the bowl shines like stars in the night sky."The Ling Long bowl is extremely important in that it is the only perfectly intact Ling Long bowl known in the world.

Pubs and bars will close temporarily and socializing prohibited indoors, but universities and retail shops will stay open.High level measures will be applied to Manchester and Nottinghamshire, meaning socializing indoors will be banned and the rule of six applied in outdoor settings, but pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open, as across the rest of the country, until 10 p.m.  Those areas placed on the medium tier will continue to follow national guidelines, with bars and pubs closing at 10 p.m. and the rule of six applied outdoors.The UK government response is for England only, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland implementing their own strategies to deal with the pandemic.Johnson says the new system is designed to avoid another national lockdown, which he says would cause long-term economic damage."This is not how we want to live our lives," he said. "But it is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic costs of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."  Johnson added: "The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country. I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed."The prime minister and his scientific advisers will continue to monitor the number of cases in each area, which could lead to an increasing number of towns and cities facing the most severe measures.England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained why cases of COVID-19 have risen so sharply the north of England compared with the rest of the country. "The epidemic this time has clearly picked up pace in the north of England earlier than it did in the first wave and that almost certainly relates to the fact that disease levels in the north never dropped, and certainly in the northwest, they never dropped as far as they dropped in the summer as they did in the south."Johnson also announced a further economic package would be introduced to replace the furlough scheme, which comes to an end at the end of this month. The support will cover two-thirds of the wages for employees of businesses forced to close as a result of the new virus restrictions.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a new three-level COVID-19 alert system across England as cases continue to rise across the country.Infection rates have quadrupled in England in the past month, and hospital admissions have doubled. The new system will apply localized measures of varying severity to the worst-hit areas of the country, with regions placed into one of three levels â medium, high or very high. Liverpool has been placed in the very high level with measures set to be imposed from Wednesday.

Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home. Jason Huth, an English teacher in Beijing, was one who decided not to travel during the holiday. "I chose to stay for a few reasons; partly because I had just got back to Beijing a few weeks ago after being stuck abroad since Chinese New Year, partly because my school strongly advised teachers not to travel too far away from Beijing due to fears of having to quarantine upon return."Many international schools and companies advised staff against travel during the break. Aletta Magrieta Strauss, a Beijing-based art teacher, said she thought this was reasonable. "If there was an outbreak and I had to quarantine as a result, work would not cover the cost. They (international schools) have already lost a lot of money and are still trying to get staff back into China."With many people having extra money to spend due to not traveling earlier in the year, and with the onus being on safety and comfort, high-end hotels saw a boom in business. Of all hotel bookings made on Trip.com during the October holiday, four- and five-star accommodation accounted for nearly half. It's anticipated that the effect will be lasting, as more people get used to the idea of "luxury staycations."This year's October holiday saw a resurgence in domestic tourism, with 637 million trips being recorded in eight days.

newspaper, the 11 countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than three months also being eligible.Eligible travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 before entering Japan and upon arrival in Japan, while their sponsors, such as companies or organizations which support them, will be expected to ensure their self-isolation for 14 days, during which time they will not be allowed to use public transport.The government had said it would consider permitting 1,000 foreigners into the country per day, mainly to accommodate those who intend to stay for three months or longer, while looking to increasing the cap in the months ahead.Foreigners with resident status here who had been overseas have recently been allowed to re-enter the county, while expatriates and other long-term residents from some Asian countries have also been granted access into the country.These include those from Vietnam, Thailand and a number of other economies with which reciprocal agreements have been made.The Japanese government has more recently made similar reciprocal agreements with Singapore and Brunei.Currently, people from 159 countries and regions have been denied entry to the country, but Japan has steadily been easing its entry restrictions. (Cover: Japan. /CFP) Japan is reportedly planning to ease travel restrictions to China and

So passengers can quickly verify their state of health and therefore avoid the exhaustive quarantine measures that have prevented passengers from bothering traveling.Currently under limited trial in Asia are digital health passports. A record for passengers who have taken a test within 72 hours to ensure a safe passage through international security.  The trial moves to the UK and Europe next week.The government's COVID-19 "safe list" of countries grows shorter by the day and gradually across the globe moments of access are being closed off again as much of the world braces itself for the second wave most knew would come but somehow hoped to avoid.Low-cost airline easyJet is now forecasting more than $1 billion in losses this year, confounding even pessimistic analysts' predictions.So far, the company has borrowed in the region of $800 million from the government, sold off aircraft and cut 4,500 jobs.Still it's calling for more action from the government.The airline says it will fly just 25 percent of its planned capacity for the rest of this year, behind rival Ryanair, which is aiming for 40 percent in October. The lumbering bulk of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet accelerating through the rain at London's Heathrow Airport has been a familiar sight since 1971 â but that's all over after British Airways retired the fleet.It's easy to blame this on the COVID-19 pandemic, but truth be told, the 747 has had its day.

It took only 3 years to build, and first went into operation 6 years ago.Chen Xin felt curious and excited when he first boarded a bullet train 6 years ago. He still remembers the day he got into a bullet train cab for the first time. He wasn't allowed to touch the control desk because his teacher was afraid that he might do something wrong and force the train to stop. Now he's become one of the best bullet train drivers in Xinjiang.Before 2011, Chen drove either diesel or electric locomotives. But he says driving bullet trains is very different, and much better."Diesel and electric locomotives don't seal properly. Sand still gets inside, even when the windows are closed," Chen said. He had to clean up the sand or it could have damaged the control desk and other devices in the cabin."Now bullet trains are wind and sand proof. So I can focus on my work, safely taking passengers to their destinations," he added.Xinjiang's first high-speed rail line officially opened in November 2014, connecting the region's capital city Urumqi with Hami, a city in east Xinjiang. The 530-kilometer trip used to take 4-6 hours. Today, it takes only 2.5 hours. Traveling by bullet train has now become a new way of life for the locals.Despite the transformation that high-speed railway has brought to the city, for Chen, one thing hasn't changed. That is the sense of responsibility."No matter what kind of locomotives you're driving, you should stick to your sense of responsibility. You should be responsible for yourself, your passengers, as well as the state property," he told CGTN.Chen has witnessed the railway's development in Xinjiang, from diesel locomotives to electric, and now bullet trains. What impressed him the most are the greater levels of efficiency as well as the working environment.The speed limit for trains in Xinjiang is now two times higher than before and Chen believes it'll be three times faster in the foreseeable future.The bullet train is changing people's way of life in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and boosting the region's economic potential.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

In its holds we discovered military vehicles, porcelain and many crates with contents still unknown."The Karlsruhe had been taking part in Operation Hannibal, one of the largest sea evacuations in history, which helped more than one million German troops and civilians from East Prussia escape the Soviet advance towards the end of World War II.  Documentation from the time suggests the boat left Koenigsberg in a hurry, with a large cargo and 1,083 people onboard."All this, put together, stimulates the human imagination. Finding the German steamer and the crates with contents as yet unknown resting on the bottom of the Baltic Sea may be significant for the whole story," said diver Tomasz Zwara.The Amber Room was constructed in Prussia and then given to Tsar Peter the Great of Russia in 1716 as a present.The Germans dismantled it and took it to Koenigsberg during the war, from where it disappeared during Allied bombing raids on the city.

They were already down about 80 percent this year, due to the impact of the pandemic on the entertainment industry.  The company reopened its UK cinemas in July but customers numbers have been small since then.Cineworld's CEO, Moody Greidinger, said it was "not a decision we made lightly.""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings," he added. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time."Greidinger's statement also highlighted the challenges the firm faced in getting studios to release new movies.  Cineworld was hoping the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, could help turn around its fortunes. But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added. The world's second largest cinema chain, Cineworld, is temporarily shutting its theaters in the U.S. and the UK.The move is due to low footfall as a result of COVID-19 and puts 45,000 jobs at risk, including 5,500 in the UK.Cineworld's shares in London plunged more than 50 percent at one stage on Monday.

He's been in this occupation for seven years so far, the period of which, nonetheless, is just a fraction of that of his father and grandfather.The apple doesn't fall far from the treeThe story began in 1958 when his grandfather Li Wangfu, a native of east China's Shandong, went from Dandong Railway Bureau to Xining on a job transfer. "I arrived here on August 15, 1958," Li Wangfu told CGTN. In his 80s, he still remembers the date clearly. After a long bumpy ride, what appeared before his eyes was a barren land where the sun blazed down straight.When the Xining railway depot was set up in October 1959, Li Wangfu became one of the few train inspectors on the sparsely populated plateau. Back then, he hunted troubles and made overhauls with a slew of clumsy tools in the daytime and lived in a cellar, which he and his colleagues dug by themselves, on a dust hill just south to the garage of the station, at night."At that time, we went to wherever they needed us," he said. Every day he went off work with his coats soaked in black engine oil. Hard work paid off. He became one of the first train inspection chiefs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1984 â the year when the railroad linking Xining and Golmud, respectively the first and second largest city of Qinghai Province, started operation.Like father, like son. Li Xiujin's foray into train maintenance was hugely impacted by his father Li Wangfu. "My father once took me on his train, I felt it was really a good job," he recalled. In 1983, he was assigned to the Golmud Depot. "Back then, it took us over two days to travel from Xining to Golmud, where sands and pebbles were flying around."Li Xiujin and his colleagues lived in a small, drafty mud hut and carried repair hammers along with them to work every day. Over the past 37 years, he witnessed the booming development of railway technologies, which has largely facilitated train inspection.The Qinghai railway system introduced an array of automatic detecting machines in 2012, amid a nationwide tech-driven development momentum. Li Xiujin learned state-of-the-art technology and became a TFDS (Train of Freight Failures Detection System) centralized analyst. "Now I can check around 300 trains every day on computer."Repair and maintenance work used to rely more on experience but now "comprehensive skills" based on technical know-how are also required to guarantee the safety of passengers, according to third-generation Li Haifeng.From steam locomotives to electric trainsIn the 1950s and 1960s, what the train offered was a bottom-rattling, days-long ride â that was the era when steam reigned railroads. Steam locomotives helped thrust the world into the first industrial revolution and have since forged ahead the human civilization for the next 150 years.In China, the production and use of steam locomotives continued into the late 1980s though most of them were phased out at a much earlier time. In the 1960s, steam trains led the development of the country's railroad networks, driving its socio-economic development.Li Wangfu witnessed the antiques being gradually sifted out and the debut of internal combustion trains and then electric trains. "We're all electrified now."Over the past decades, China's train technology is all but obsolete. His son and grandson saw more unfathomable developments. "Previously on the Xining-Golmud section, the train ran at merely some 50 kilometers per hour, but now it could reach 160 kilometers," noted Li Haifeng.Now China has the world's biggest high-speed railway network, along with advanced inspecting methods for the facilities and equipment on the train."We have switched from heavy manual labor to mental work, just like a physician in a hospital," said Li Xiujin, "We just sit indoors, watch pictures taken by high-speed cameras, and report problems to on-site inspectors with the help of TFDS."For Li Haifeng, the work is much less laborious but requires more expertise. The train he works on has a UV filter inbuilt in its window, oxygen generators, and automatic excrement processing devices amid a variety of new facilities."Working on the train is tough, as you need to take into account the safety of every passenger. It's like being a 'doctor' who knows everything about the train and gives the right prescription," Li Haifeng said.Video director: Yu YingtianCameraman: Guo YuanhengText by Wang XiaonanCopy editor: Oscar MargainVoiceover: Sim Sim WissgottProduction assistant: Yu WenwenProducer: Zhang XiaoheSupervisor: Zhang Shilei"I'm continuing the dream of my father and grandfather," said Li Haifeng, a train inspector at the Xining Depot â the place where the trains on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway blew their first whistle.Thirty-one-year-old Li has been investigating and troubleshooting undetected faults in the facilities of each coach to ensure the safety of every train journey.

"Now I can check around 300 trains every day on computer."Repair and maintenance work used to rely more on experience but now "comprehensive skills" based on technical know-how are also required to guarantee the safety of passengers, according to third-generation Li Haifeng.From steam locomotives to electric trainsIn the 1950s and 1960s, what the train offered was a bottom-rattling, days-long ride â that was the era when steam reigned railroads. Steam locomotives helped thrust the world into the first industrial revolution and have since forged ahead the human civilization for the next 150 years.In China, the production and use of steam locomotives continued into the late 1980s though most of them were phased out at a much earlier time. In the 1960s, steam trains led the development of the country's railroad networks, driving its socio-economic development.Li Wangfu witnessed the antiques being gradually sifted out and the debut of internal combustion trains and then electric trains. "We're all electrified now."Over the past decades, China's train technology is all but obsolete. His son and grandson saw more unfathomable developments. "Previously on the Xining-Golmud section, the train ran at merely some 50 kilometers per hour, but now it could reach 160 kilometers," noted Li Haifeng.Now China has the world's biggest high-speed railway network, along with advanced inspecting methods for the facilities and equipment on the train."We have switched from heavy manual labor to mental work, just like a physician in a hospital," said Li Xiujin, "We just sit indoors, watch pictures taken by high-speed cameras, and report problems to on-site inspectors with the help of TFDS."For Li Haifeng, the work is much less laborious but requires more expertise. The train he works on has a UV filter inbuilt in its window, oxygen generators, and automatic excrement processing devices amid a variety of new facilities."Working on the train is tough, as you need to take into account the safety of every passenger. It's like being a 'doctor' who knows everything about the train and gives the right prescription," Li Haifeng said.Video director: Yu YingtianCameraman: Guo YuanhengText by Wang XiaonanCopy editor: Oscar MargainVoiceover: Sim Sim WissgottProduction assistant: Yu WenwenProducer: Zhang XiaoheSupervisor: Zhang ShileiDuring China's National Day holiday, museums and art galleries across the country are arranging an array of cultural treats.

With the help of the government, they have moved out from the deep mountains and started a new life in well-constructed communities.Walking into the kitchen of a Dulong family, we found modern electrical appliances, a traditional fire pit and, surprisingly, a black piglet sleeping very well beside the warm fire. Unlike dogs or cats which are kept for pets, the pig is one of their livestock. Living with animals is common among some ethnic groups who living in remote areas. The fire pit sits on a three-legged iron frame. As it is used for warming the house and cooking, the fire pit is at the center of family life for humans and animals alike. When the piglet grows up, it will be sent to the pigsty.

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

The event is expected to attract more than 10,000 people and the area desperately needs to build and upgrade its transportation infrastructure, hotel capacity, and other vital city services.A brief tour of Kisumu reveals road improvements and new road construction, especially in the central business district.Africities-Kisumu Secretariat Chief Executive Officer Joe Ager submits more improvements are on the way."More roads around this city are being revamped ahead of Africa's premier conference. They will be good; they will be beautiful and the government set aside a budget for that."Kisumu has at least a 9000-bed capacity for the hotels. Additional hotel space is being planned in locations on the outskirts of the city.Achie Ojany Alai, the minister for tourism, culture, and sports in the county, says already some resorts outside the city have been earmarked for the guests' accommodation."We are here at Siala Resort, my role as a minister is to make sure that the resorts, the hotels, the clubs, the restaurants, are ready ahead of the event."She adds that they are linking some of the hotels and resorts with major airlines to make it easy for the visitors when they arrive in Kisumu.For the past few years, the national government has embarked on various infrastructural projects to change the face of Kisumu which is also an entry point for ships from Tanzania and Uganda.The projects among them rehabilitation of the port of Kisumu and the Kisumu International airport is part of the plan to ready the city for the 2021 conference."The sheer numbers of the visitors expected in Kisumu, have prompted the government to expand the Airport to about 3-4 times its present size. Not only the lounges but the checking areas, the customs area, the Apron, the food courts will also be enhanced," says Mr. Ager.Regional leaders are also hopeful the event can attract billions of dollars in future business and economic opportunities as well as jobs."There are many investment opportunities for the people living in Kisumu from the accommodation, anybody in the conference, service providers will get a great opportunity," says Kisumu County Communications Director Atieno Otieno. "Moreover our infrastructure will improve greatly as we work towards hosting this great conference."She says Kisumu citizens are ready to share their friendliness and culture with the rest of the continent."It is something that we've been yearning to show the world and this is a great opportunity for us.""It was felt about 30 years ago that these forms of government should come together every 3 years.

The event is expected to attract more than 10,000 people and the area desperately needs to build and upgrade its transportation infrastructure, hotel capacity, and other vital city services.A brief tour of Kisumu reveals road improvements and new road construction, especially in the central business district.Africities-Kisumu Secretariat Chief Executive Officer Joe Ager submits more improvements are on the way."More roads around this city are being revamped ahead of Africa's premier conference. They will be good; they will be beautiful and the government set aside a budget for that."Kisumu has at least a 9000-bed capacity for the hotels. Additional hotel space is being planned in locations on the outskirts of the city.Achie Ojany Alai, the minister for tourism, culture, and sports in the county, says already some resorts outside the city have been earmarked for the guests' accommodation."We are here at Siala Resort, my role as a minister is to make sure that the resorts, the hotels, the clubs, the restaurants, are ready ahead of the event."She adds that they are linking some of the hotels and resorts with major airlines to make it easy for the visitors when they arrive in Kisumu.For the past few years, the national government has embarked on various infrastructural projects to change the face of Kisumu which is also an entry point for ships from Tanzania and Uganda.The projects among them rehabilitation of the port of Kisumu and the Kisumu International airport is part of the plan to ready the city for the 2021 conference."The sheer numbers of the visitors expected in Kisumu, have prompted the government to expand the Airport to about 3-4 times its present size. Not only the lounges but the checking areas, the customs area, the Apron, the food courts will also be enhanced," says Mr. Ager.Regional leaders are also hopeful the event can attract billions of dollars in future business and economic opportunities as well as jobs."There are many investment opportunities for the people living in Kisumu from the accommodation, anybody in the conference, service providers will get a great opportunity," says Kisumu County Communications Director Atieno Otieno. "Moreover our infrastructure will improve greatly as we work towards hosting this great conference."She says Kisumu citizens are ready to share their friendliness and culture with the rest of the continent."It is something that we've been yearning to show the world and this is a great opportunity for us.""It was felt about 30 years ago that these forms of government should come together every 3 years.

People across the country reunite with family and friends, and enjoy the charm of moon together. Some people will choose to watch Peking Opera during the festivities, classic opera "Drunken Concubine" is one of the most widely circulated ones. It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera. "Drunken Concubine" has been performed in many countries including Russia, Austria and North Korea.Mid-Autumn Festival meets Peking OperaYu Kuizhi and Li Shengsu are two Peking Opera masters of the China National Peking Opera Company.

Mei took the traditional Chinese art abroad in the early 20th century, impressing foreign audiences with his beautiful voice and unforgettable performances. "Peking Opera needs to be passed down from one generation to the next, and our cultural exchanges with other countries also needed to be passed down like this," Yu told CGTN. Traditional festivals give people a chance to know more about time-honored culture like the Peking Opera, and also allows people to enjoy the country's national treasures. (Cover image designed bu Xu Qianyun)The Mid-Autumn Festival falls on October 1 this year, marking one of the most important and poetic Chinese festivals.

The themed flower parterre along Chang'an Avenue has also been in place to welcome the upcoming National Day.  The themed flowerbeds along Chang'an Avenue were created with over 200 flower varieties and depict themes including "all-around well-off society" and "hard-won battle against the epidemic," highlighting the historical achievements in the course of the country's development.  In Harbin City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, a symphony concert titled "Me and My Motherland" was held Wednesday.  The residents in Yuncheng City, north China's Shanxi Province, also expressed their love for the motherland through music by organizing a community variety show with various song and dance performances.    Reuniting with friends and loved ones is customary during the festive celebrations. In Gongliu County of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, neighbors and friends from near and far gathered to make and enjoy local delicacies like Dapanji, or big plate chicken stew, and moon cakes.  "We put pomegranate seeds on moon cakes, signifying that people of all ethnic groups remain closely united like the seeds of a pomegranate that stick together, and we all live a prosperous life," resident Guzinay told CGTN.  The attractions and featured streets in many places were lit up with dazzling lights, forming gorgeous night scenes.  At the Yellow River Tower in Lanzhou City, northwest China's Gansu Province, a 3D projection light show was held with dazzling lights illuminating the mother river and the night sky.  In Nanjing City, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, the nighttime economy injects vitality into Changjiang Road, a popular scenic spot with 1,800 years of history.  Tourists can visit the night market, taste delicious food and watch a show at the theater.    "I think it's good to bring my kid here to experience the culture and distinctive atmosphere of Nanjing," said resident Zhang Xiao.  In Hezhou City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 2,300 drones changed formations in the night sky from time to time, forming patterns like the Chinese national flag and Tiananmen Rostrum, bringing viewers a visual feast.  In Shangqiu City, central China's Henan Province, a marvelous molten iron-splashing show awed spectators.  Listed as a national intangible cultural heritage item, the molten iron-splashing performance features one blacksmith throwing a ladle of molten iron up to the sky and another blacksmith beating the molten iron with a wooden club, creating a fascinating firework-like display to usher in the new year and extend wishes for good harvests. The activity can be traced back more than 1,000 years ago.In Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the ancient city wall was lit in red, and the words "Celebrate National Day" and "I love you, motherland" were projected on its surface. A huge five-star red flag was also passed through the crowd, expressing people's affectionate blessings to the motherland. (Cover image: People celebrate the National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival at Tiananmen Square in Beijing. /CFP)As the country's National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival both fall on October 1 this year, Chinese cities are festooned with flowers and lanterns and holding colorful activities to celebrate the joyful occasion.  At the center of Tiananmen Square in Beijing, one of China's most iconic landmarks, a giant flower and fruit basket was readied on September 24.

It provides help to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in the area, such as English lessons and financial budgeting.She thinks the UK should be doing more to provide safe and legal routes for asylum and said "shutting the door in people's faces isn't going to make this issue go away."Chapman added: "In the grand scheme of displaced people in the world, it's a relatively small number and the UK really does need to do its bit. France takes four times as many asylum applications as we do. Germany takes 10 times as many."But not everyone thinks Britain should be as welcoming, particularly in the middle of a global COVID-19 pandemic that has curtailed travel for millions of people worldwide. On the streets of Dover, there appeared to be support for tougher immigration policies."They all come over here. They could be murderers, terrorists and no one's stopping them. They're pretending to be children and they're like 30 years old," said Leigh, a local resident."It's about time somebody put a stop to it, isn't it?" said Janet, another Dover resident. "I mean, we haven't got any schools, we've got no hospitals, we've got nothing. So how can we bring all these extra people in?" she added.Daniel, 32, said the arrivals had transformed the area: "The population has gone from a normal, British civilization to â¦ half of us aren't even British. Come on, we're not being funny, who's pure British these days?"The sentiments highlight the concern and anger felt by some parts of the UK's population about a perceived lack of control of its borders.The issue of immigration was a key part of the Brexit debate, which culminated in Britain's departure from the European Union. Soon, that will mean an end to the free movement of people to and from the EU. But for many migrants, their journey to the UK is often long and perilous."They come from places where there are problems: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Sudan are common countries, also Syria, of course," said Chapman, back at the refugee center.Britain's government wants to make it easier to return potential asylum seekers who arrive from France and said smuggling gangs are profiting from the latest surge.Figures at the end of September suggest around 7,000 had made the journey, more than three times as many as in the whole of 2019.The latest increase in arrivals looks unlikely to stop any time soon. It's a journey that could mean life or death â but for the thousands attempting it, reaching the UK is worth risking the ultimate price.September has been the busiest month on record for migrants attempting to cross the English Channel.Around 2,000 people have been picked up by the UK's Border Force this month, many on small boats or dinghies, which are often unsafe.The UK recently beefed up patrols in the world's busiest shipping lane to dissuade people from embarking on the journey, often from France.The issue is being particularly felt in places such as Dover, a picturesque town in southern England where many migrants first arrive.  Bridget Chapman works with the nearby Kent Refugee Action Network.

However, it is hard to spot Victorine Obola's small photo studio, despite it being one of the busiest places inDunga. People from all over Kisumu county flock here to capture their memorable moments on the shores of the largest freshwater lake in Africa.Some are photographed while on the beach while others prefer to have their photos deep into the waters while boat riding. Weekends ushers in a beehive of activities for friends and families who want to experience the cool breeze here, eat fish, or just while away time.This is where Miss Obola plies her trade and this has turned her into the most sought-after photographer on the beach. This is manifested in the long ques of people lining up waiting for their photographs to be processed in her studio.She juggles between her interests in photography and the highly competitive but male-dominated profession of being a coxswain."What happened is that while doing door-to-door photography in the market, I saw a school bus by the roadside,â she says. "I went near it and talked to the driver and requested them if the teacher would want some photos to be taken because it seemed they had come for a tour. So they accepted. They told me they were looking for a photographer but they did not know where to get one. So I got onto the bus, we went to Kisumu Airport, then Kisumu Lakeport took them some photos, then they came to Dunga beach for boat riding,âShe was also fortunate to be admitted by the Dunga Beach Management, to practice her trade here. She however did not know that she would end up also doubling as a coxswain.Initially, she had been working in a photography studio owned that time by a member of parliament in Kisumu city."I had a passion for photography. I decided to go to my member of Parliament who employed me in his studio. I worked there for one year.â"After that I decided to buy a small camera, using my savings. It cost around Ksh.8000/$80.The first day I went to Kibuye, the jua kali sector, I talked to a few people. Luckily the first day I got Ksh.350/$3.I also took photos of my neighbors.âAfter getting a permit to work as a photographer at the beach, she also saw another opportunity. An opportunity to learn boat-riding skills and earn an extra coin."Since I had a passion in physics and there are some topics that we were taught in high-school concerning navigation, navigating a ship, I just had the interest and so I talked to some coxswains around to see if they could train me and they accepted.âBut what happens in case there are clients who need their moments at the beach captured on camera and those who need to be boat ridden in the Victorian waters?"There are so many male coxswains around, but in case I get a customer who wants boat riding, I talk to my fellow photographers to help me as I do the boat riding, âShe says.Her job requires an agile person and who is hawk-eyed to be able to spot clients streaming into the beach. But not just that, one needs to be patient and persuasive to convince them to be photographed and part with some cash rather than using their own phones to do it."The major obstacle is this era of digital. Personally, I trained using a manual camera, but people come with their phones. You just have to explain and tell them why you want them to use your camera," Obola submits.Additionally, she says, with regards to being a coxswain, there are customers who do not have confidence in a woman. But some only want to be taken to the lake by a lady, and if it's not her turn because they ride these boats in turns, they refuse to go with male coxswain.Obola however says she faces those challenges in stride knowing that her two jobs help her put food on the table as well as educate her siblings."I come from a family of nine. I am the 6th born and I am the breadwinner because I have been able to educate my three siblings in high school and university level using the same photography and boat riding work.âIt has been four years of photography and boat-riding at Lake Victoria. But for the 36-year-old Obola, expanding her territory is her biggest dream now.The Kenyan government has established a marine school at the Port of Kisumu and Miss Obola wants to take advantage of the institution to hone her boat-riding skills and become a certified coxswain soon."If the light of God illuminates my life one day one time, I get a speed boat, after having gotten the certificate to do my own, have my own boat because these ones are not mine.â"And as for my photography, my ambition is to have a big studio right in the town center with big digital machines plus the latest machines for lamination in bulk so that customers will be coming to do their photo-shoot and get what they want," she concludes.As we finish our interview with her, she smiles at the next clients who want to be photographed. She quickly bids us goodbye and tells me that life is to be lived and to be enjoyed but the biggest step is to not fear anything.When one visits Kisumu city lying on the western parts of Kenya at the shores of Lake Victoria, one cannot miss an opportunity to sample some of its beautiful beaches among them, Dunga beach that is just an 8 kilometers drive from the city center.The beach is alive thanks to various activities going on.

Besides buying mooncakes, the occasion is also marked in artistic ways.Making Chinese tea is quite a complicated and demanding job. The tea leaves, the tools and every procedure counts. At the Dajue Temple in Beijing, a demonstration showcases how to make green tea properly."Chinese tea culture has a history of thousands of years," said Murong Zigui, director of the Minghui Teahouse. "Every year, we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Day at the Dajue Temple. We hope that people would always remember this quiet and happy moment in their life, drinking tea and watching Guqin performance at this ancient site."Such events featuring traditional Chinese culture are frequently held at the temple for the past 20 years. Tasting tea and playing Guqin, a seven-string musical instrument, was a way for friends to spend time together in ancient China.Guqin artist Yang Qing believes that the two art forms share something in common. "The taste of Chinese tea is considered to be mild, restrained and it has a lingering aftertaste. And the sound of Guqin is considered heavy and rich, inspiring positive sentiments from the bottom of one's heart. Both art forms give people a feeling of jade-like warmness and smoothness, and are deeply favored by Chinese people," he said.In distant Luxembourg, a similar celebration featuring Chinese tea culture has also been held. The relaxing occasion, as its Chinese organizers say, is supposed to allow people to release some stress during the pandemic."We organized Wenshi Tea ceremonies for French friends to introduce them this traditional way of drinking tea that originated from the Tang Dynasty. I feel that French people are really interested in that," said Duan Xiaoyang, president of the Sino-European Association for Art and Intercultural Communication.Various celebrations are taking place across China and abroad to celebrate this year's traditional Mid-Autumn Festival. Besides buying mooncakes, the occasion is also marked in artistic ways.Making Chinese tea is quite a complicated and demanding job. The tea leaves, the tools and every procedure counts.

The authorities suggest that tourists pay attention to their safety and check ticket reservations have been confirmed before traveling.Scenic attractions have increased capacity for visitorsBecause Mid-Autumn Festival coincides with the National Day holiday in 2020, this year's Golden Week holiday is one day longer than usual, and the eight-day holiday has made Chinese tourists even more eager to go out.China State Railway Group said on Monday that the National Day railway rush will start on September 28. From September 28 to October 8, China's railways are expected to carry 108 million passengers, an average of 9.82 million per day.October 1 will be the peak, with an estimated 13 million passengers on the rails, the highest daily passenger flow since the outbreak of the pandemic, the group said.In order to meet the needs of tourists, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has lifted the upper limit for visitors at cultural and tourist locations from 50 percent to 75 percent of capacity.According to a notice released by the authority of Mount Huashan scenic area on September 28, the daily maximum passenger flow limit will be 20,000 and ticket sales will be stopped when the limit is reached.Meanwhile, starting from September 28, the maximum daily capacity for visitors to Mount Huangshan has been expanded from 25,000 to 37,500.From September 25, the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang City also raised the maximum daily limit of each ticket type to 75 percent of the normal capacity.Tickets to popular attractions are hard to getThe eight-day Golden Week has inspired people to travel. Some scenic attractions are already booked up, with popular spots such as the Palace Museum selling out from October 1 to 8.Tickets for the Jiuzhaigou Sparkling Lake in Sichuan Province from October 2 to 4 have also sold out.The ministry urged travelers to book tickets to scenic spots in advance.No booking, no travelShan Gangxin, deputy head of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism's resource development department, said that tourism sites should be opened and tickets booked in an orderly manner under the premise of overall prevention and control of the pandemic.The ministry also reminded tourists to understand and inquire in advance about epidemic prevention and control measures, opening hours, ticket reservations and passenger flow restrictions so as to ensure "no booking, no travel."For example, the Mount Huashan scenic area in northwest China's Shaanxi Province requires all tourists to register with the Shaanxi Health Code before booking tickets. Those with a green health code can book tickets, while those with a yellow or red code cannot.The Mount Huangshan scenic area in east China's Anhui Province also requires visitors to show a successful test or a matching ID card with health code and undertake a temperature test before entering the scenic area.Minimize 'unnecessary outbound travel'The Department of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded Chinese citizens to pay close attention to security alerts and overseas epidemic information issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassies and consulates. It also urged travelers to fully assess the serious risks of cross-infection and the long quarantine period brought by international travel and minimize "unnecessary travel."(Cover image from CFP)With Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day approaching, some popular scenic attractions in China, such as the Palace Museum, are already booked up for the holiday, while other attractions are selling out fast.

Read our guide to the most widely used including the Antibody, PCR and Antigen tests â explaining exactly what they do, how much they cost and how accurate they are.When the immune system is exposed to COVID-19, it produces IgG antibodies to fight the virus. A COVID-19 antibody test looks for IgG antibodies in a blood sample â if present, that means you have had the illness. Studies have shown antibodies are produced approximately 14 days after the start of the illness, so the best time to take the test is 14 to 21 days after feeling unwell.What does a positive result mean?A positive result means you have been exposed to the virus and your immune system has produced antibodies in response. A small number of people may have had the virus and produced antibodies without ever feeling unwell, meaning they are asymptomatic carriers. What does a negative result mean?A true negative result means the immune system hasn't produced antibodies because you haven't been exposed to the virus. However, a false negative is when you have been exposed to the virus but antibodies haven't been identified, either because the test was taken too soon or the body simply hasn't produced antibodies to fight the virus.Is the test accurate?The Roche antibody test widely used in the UK is 100 percent accurate in identifying IgG antibodies and 99.8 percent accurate in determining that there are no antibodies in the bloodstream. However, the timings of the test (pictured above) mean false negatives can occur, so it's imperative the test is taken within the 14-to-21-day window for optimal accuracy.How much does it cost?In the UK, only certain people who work in social care in England and Wales are able to get an antibody test for free. Otherwise, they must be bought at private clinics, with prices starting at $84. In Germany, the same test costs $76.How long will it take to get my results?Results typically take up to 72 hours from private health services. The PCR test is used to detect whether the COVID-19 virus is currently present in your body. This is done by looking for evidence of the virus's genetic material, known as RNA, from a swab sample taken from the nose and back of the throat. In the lab, a reagent is added to the sample â if the RNA is present the reagent sparks a chain reaction so it is visible to scientists, who can then correctly identify a positive test. The test is also commonly referred to as an RNA, genetic, molecular, viral detection or swab test.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?PCR tests vary in accuracy. Some can be as low as 70 percent accurate, as outlined here by Oxford University Hospitals in the UK. However, FIND (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics), tested five COVID-19 RT-PCR tests and found that all five achieved 100 percent specitivity on positive samples, and at least 96 percent specificity on negative samples.How much does it cost?Most European countries have made PCR tests available for free, though foreign nationals entering many EU countries have to pay. Travelers landing at Germany's Munich airport are being charged $213 for a PCR test.How long will it take to get my results?Between 12 and 24 hours but new technology available in some hospitals and medical practices can return results within just four hours. Similar to PCR tests, antigen tests also attempt to find out if you currently have the virus, but the process is slightly different. Rather than looking for the virus's genetic material, an antigen test looks for the presence of proteins or glycans, such as the spike proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus, via a swab sample taken from the nose and mouth.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?Antigen tests are typically very fast and cheap in many countries but are not as accurate as PCR tests, with some experts claiming they could miss 15-20 percent of infections when only small amounts of proteins or glycans are present. How much does it cost?Private UK test centers charge up to $173, while in France, they are available in pharmacies for as little as $15.How long will it take to get my results?Antigen tests are the fastest of the COVID-19 tests, with some producing results in just a few minutes.A range of COVID-19 tests are being used across Europe.

Mgahinga is also home to the endangered mountain gorillas."Golden monkeys are special in that they have an outstanding color that is nearly to the gold color, they are unique in that you can only track them from the Virunga Massif,âJoyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide at Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) told Xinhua in a recent visit to the park. UWA is a state-owned conservation agency.High up the ridges of the volcanic Mount Muhabura, which is part of Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, the golden monkeys feed on largely bamboo shoots. They live in troops of about 100, led by an Alpha male, according to UWA.Uganda has one habituated troop of about 60 golden monkeys and another group of about 80 monkeys is also being habituated as the country builds new tourist attractions.Golden monkeys are endangered species. According to UWA, tourists who come to see the mountain gorillas, which are the country's main tourist attractions, can also track the golden monkeys.Before tracking the monkeys, at the park gate, standard operating procedures like hand sanitizing, face mask-wearing and social distancing are practiced in a bid to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19 to the monkeys.About 300 meters before reaching the golden monkeys, visitors are hand sanitized again and urged to keep their face masks on. Visitors are also not allowed to get less than 10 meters away from the animals.Tourism is one of Uganda's major foreign exchange earners, bringing in about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars annually, according to ministry of finance figures.Although the sector has been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, government is optimistic that it will pick up as the country continues to ease the lockdown restrictions.Abiaz Rwamwiri, director at Africa Wild Explorations, a tour agency told Xinhua in a recent interview that once the country's international airport opens up on Oct. 1, as planned by government, tourists may start flocking in.Rwamwiri said that there are some confirmed tours scheduled for next year.Tucked on the common border with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda's Mgahinga Gorilla National Park is host to the endangered golden monkeys, a new tourist attraction.Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, which is part of the Virunga Massif is where "gold meets silver,âa tourism marketing catchphrase meaning a place where the golden monkeys coexist with the mountain gorilla silverbacks.

The football-obsessed SEC begins its season with fans in stadiums. Several teams in other leagues have had to postpone games because of outbreaks among players and staff.Institutions across the nation saw spikes of thousands of cases days after opening their doors in the last month, driven by students socializing with little or no social distancing. School and community leaders have tried to rein in the virus by closing bars, suspending students, adding mask requirements, and toggling between in-person and online instruction as case numbers rise and fall. Tension over the outbreaks is starting to boil over in college towns. Faculty members from at least two universities have held no-confidence votes in recent weeks against their top leaders, in part over reopening decisions. Government leaders want the University of Wisconsin-Madison to send its students home. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, alarmed by what he sees as draconian rules on college campuses, said he is drawing up a "bill of rights" for college students. In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, this week blamed outbreaks at two colleges for a surge of virus cases that boosted the state's infection rate high enough to put it on the list of places whose residents are required to quarantine when traveling to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The University of Wisconsin-Madison had seen more than 2,800 confirmed cases in students as of Friday. The school shut down in-person instruction for two weeks, locked down two of its largest dorms, and imposed quarantines on more than a dozen sorority and fraternity houses. The school lifted the dorm lockdown just this week. Dane County Executive Joe Parisi has demanded the university send all its students home for the rest of the academic year. "(The virus) was under control until the university came back," Parisi said. Chancellor Rebecca Blank has fired back, saying tens of thousands of students with off-campus housing would still come to the city. She accused Parisi of failing to enforce capacity restrictions in bars and off-campus parties."You can't simply wish (students) away, nor should you," Blank said in a statement directed at Parisi. Amid the fighting, thousands of students around the country have been quarantined in dorm rooms. At Kansas State University, more than 2,200 students have been placed in quarantine or isolation since class began. Student Emily Howard was isolated in what students have dubbed "COVID jail" after she and her dorm roommate tested positive for the virus on September 4, just three weeks after arriving on campus. "Now you walk around campus (and) pretty much everyone says they've had it," Howard said. "Now we don't really care as much because we know we had the antibodies." Bryan Fisher, a UW-Madison freshman quarantined in the dorms, said students were allowed to leave only to get food from the dining hall, and they were given only 30 minutes to make each trip. He said he spent his time studying and watching movies. "We were pretty much stuck in here," Fisher said. "It's been pretty hard to meet new people. Everyone's expectations of college aren't what they were." The University of Connecticut on Friday placed a third dormitory under medical quarantine. More than 150 students have tested positive. The University of Missouri has had more than 1,500 confirmed cases among students since classes began. The school plans to limit the crowd at Saturday's home football opener against Alabama to no more than 11,700 fans, leaving the stands about 80 percent empty. Florida State on Friday decided to require that students test negative for the virus a week before a football game before being allowed to attend and must wear masks in the stands. Seminoles coach Mike Norvell tested positive for the virus last week. Despite the attempts at mitigation, student cases have sent local county infection numbers soaring. Schools' decisions to push on with the semester have frustrated some faculty and local community leaders. Faculty members at Appalachian State in August approved a no-confidence vote against Chancellor Sheri Everts over university finances, morale and reopening plans. Everts has said she has received support from the school's Board of Trustees. The University of Michigan faculty took a no-confidence vote against President Mark Schlissel earlier this month. Faculty felt Schlisselâs administration hasnât been transparent about reopening decisions and hasnât released any modeling gauging the health risks. Graduate students went on strike Sept. 8 to protest reopening. Schlissel has acknowledged that trust in his leadership had slipped, but the universityâs governing board expressed support him this week. "Colleges and universities are ... under immense pressure to remain open," said Chris Mariscano, director of the College Crisis Initiative, a research project at Davidson College tracking the effects of the virus on higher education. "When the president of the United States starts tweeting (about staying open), you understand just how much politics is playing a role here and institutional survival is playing a role here." University officials across the country say they hope to bolster testing and contact tracing as the semester continues. But Mariscano said universities should expect college students to act like college students. At Kansas State, Howard was not especially concerned about the virus and didn't mind the "COVID Jail," where students got free laundry service and their own bedrooms. "I personally am not too worried about it, and everyone I have talked to is not that worried about it," she said. "I think it is more like, you are going to get it. It's just a matter of when."(Cover image: Auburn students are scanned to check for a health screening questionnaire before entering the stadium for the start of an NCAA college football game between Auburn and Kentucky, September 26, 2020. /AP)Colleges across the U.S. are struggling to salvage the fall semester amid skyrocketing coronavirus cases, entire dorm complexes and frat houses under quarantine, and flaring tensions with local community leaders over the spread of the disease. Many major universities are determined to forge ahead despite warning signs, as evidenced by the expanding slate of college football games occurring Saturday.

On Sunday, 2,999 people tested positive for COVID-19, a new daily record.The number of foreigners visiting the Netherlands is 70 percent lower than last year. Major events that were set in the Netherlands, Such as the Formula One Grand Prix, the Eurovision Song Contest and the UEFA Euro 2020 football tournament, were all canceled. Instead of the 21 million expected visitors, only seven million showed up. Also, 40 percent fewer Dutch people are going on holiday in their own country. This brings tourism in the Netherlands back to the level of the 1990s. Rahul Pathak in MadridIt's being reported that the socialist government of Pedro Sanchez could force the Madrid regional government to implement stricter coronavirus measures.  Right now 45 neighbourhoods in and around Madrid are under some form of lockdown, but the national government wants that extended to the entire city, which has the worst infection rate in Europe.  So far the right wing coalition government of Isabel Ayuso is resisting any further restrictions prompting the central government to say that it is prepared to intervene if there is "an urgent need." Isobel Ewing in BudapestPrime Minister Viktor Orban has assured Hungarians that the country will procure a vaccine against the coronavirus and it will be made available to everyone who needs it.Speaking on commercial broadcaster TV2, Orban said: "Brussels estimates the vaccine will be ready by 2021, while the Americans expect it to be ready by the end of the year".He added: "We'll be free from this misery and we will endure it until then."Orban said the coronavirus pandemic is worsening in Hungary and the situation is difficult, with a lot of pressure on health and education both now and in the coming months. However, he believes that as the winter months approach, people will be more inclined to abide by hygiene rules.Andrew Wilson in LondonThe government is expected to enforce a total social lockdown on large parts of the country today, including London. Pubs and restaurants could be ordered to close for two weeks and households banned from meeting each other.As of today, people face a heavy fine if they do not self-isolate after a positive test or are told to quarantine by test-and-trace services. Household members should also self-isolate by law.The police are expected to start carrying out spot checks in areas where there are high levels of the virus.Thousands of university students remain in self-isolation in their halls of residence. Ministers say any complaints about fees should be directed at the institutions, not the government. Ross Cullen in ParisIn France, the latest measures came into force overnight on Sunday into Monday, including the closure of all bars and restaurants in Marseille, Aix-en-Provence and Guadeloupe. In Paris, sports centers and gyms have closed and bars in the capital now must close at 10 p.m. These measures will be in place for at least two weeks. The moves come as a new poll in the Journal de Dimanche Sunday newspaper shows that 72 percent of French citizens are in favor of new nationwide lockdown for at least 15 days. In the same survey, it showed that only 44 percent of those polled said they trusted the government to help businesses recover. On Monday, finance minister Bruno Le Maire will present the budget for next year. The 2021 finance bill sets out the main lines of the $116 billion stimulus plan and the government says its forecasts have anticipated a possible deterioration in economic health. FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: WHO backs China's emergency use of COVID-19 vaccinesCGTN America: Is New York dead?

Many online platforms are believed to be using this information to manipulate the prices we pay for the products and services we frequently use so that we end up paying more than others. The Chinese government has said such activities must stop. With China's National Day Golden Week starting on October 1, the directive could not be more timely. The pandemic is largely under control across the country, and millions of people will be capitalizing on the easing measures to get away for a few days.Online bookings are the preferred choice, but it seems the more you use certain platforms, the more susceptible you are to higher prices. "Some platforms have a huge mass of people's personal information, and use artificial intelligence algorithms to personalize prices for these people. Then price discrimination may occur," said Zhi Zhenfeng, a research fellow at the Institute of Law at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "It is likely a violation of consumer rights laws," Zhi said. "Although there are many laws protecting personal information, there is no specific law in this regard. This gives some fraudulent sellers the opportunity to personalize prices." The government has identified this problem and has issued temporary regulations. They stipulate that online travel agencies should obtain the consent of users before collecting their personal information.Users should know what's being recorded, why it's being recorded and how it will be used. Meanwhile, online travel agencies are told not to use people's information to personalize or bump-up prices."The new regulation could protect consumers' rights and interests by defining the responsibilities of the online travel agencies," said Zhi. "It will improve the environment of consumers to a certain extent." However, the problem isn't exclusive to travel. It also happens when customers purchase goods online or even order food. Once these platforms understand your preferences through big data, they can manipulate the price you have to pay.So what can consumers do to avoid paying more?"When consumers register on these online platforms, they should pay close attention to the information they're being asked for," Zhi said. "They should make sure what kind of authorization the platform would get. If the platform requires excessive information, for example, a lot of personal information, then consumers should file a complaint if they can't refuse."Zhi also warned about the information that gets collected when companies give away gifts and discounts. "It's better to refrain from small gains online, such as swiping a QR code or clicking an electronic gift," Zhi said. "Sometimes you are required to fill in some personal information, which is likely leaked to the third party."Our online data contain a great deal of information about our personal lives.

As the eight-day National Day holiday fast approaches, the annual ecological tourism festival featuring Populus euphratica is scheduled to open in Ejin during the Golden Week.Populus euphratica, also known as desert poplar, is a rare species that can survive in extremely dry and cold regions, commonly found in temperate deserts in China's western part. Sitting in the Gobi Desert, Ejin is home to one of the largest Populus euphratica forests in the country â nearly 30,000 hectares.Over the years, by putting the rich resources of poplar desert forests into good use, Ejin has made various efforts in developing the tourism industry while preserving the rare species. The thriving tourism businesses have boosted the local economy and helped those once impoverished households escape extreme poverty.Ejin has built several tourist attractions, among which the Populus Euphratica Forest Tourist Area has now become one of the must-visit spots in autumn for outings and photographs and also a landmark in Ejin.The booming tourism sector has then tempted more local farmers and herdsmen to join the cooperative to run various tourism-related businesses, such as opening homestay inns, offering horse-riding, camel-riding, as well as off-riding vehicle rental services at the scenic spot.As of the end of 2019, 63 registered poor households (146 people) in Ejin were able to witness a surge in their earnings through working in the tourism industry. Statistics from the local government showed that their average annual income saw an increase of 13,637 yuan (2,000 U.S. dollars) per household compared with the previous year.Acknowledging the significant role that the ecological environment has played in Ejin's tourism development, local people started to make efforts in ecological construction and preservation. In 2018, China Green Foundation, a non-governmental organization, launched a "Euphrates poplar project" in Inner Mongolia in a bid to fight desertification. Also, in this June, the local government launched a set of regulations on protecting the desert poplar forests in Ejin.Read more: Inner Mongolia's rejuvenating desert poplar forestsLast year from January to November, Ejin received a total of 8 million domestic and foreign tourists, a year-on-year increase of 15 percent, with the overall tourism revenue exceeding 7.6 billion yuan (1.1 billion U.S. dollars), according to Du Zigang, deputy director of the local culture and tourism bureau.

Holding carnival - whether it's samba schools or 'blocos,' any kind of carnival with crowds of people - without certainty on a vaccine or guarantees for people's health is a mistake," said Rita Fernandes, president of the Sebastiana association."Sebastiana has decided that without a vaccine and especially without health guarantees for the population, we're not going to hold any kind of carnival at all," she told TV network Globo News.Rio's carnival, the world's biggest, draws millions of tourists from around Brazil and the world each year.But it has become the latest casualty of the pandemic, as Brazil struggles to get a handle on the second-deadliest outbreak of COVID-19 in the world, after the United States.Brazil has registered 4.7 million infections and nearly 140,000 deaths from the virus.And while its spread has slowed somewhat since July, the numbers are still alarmingly high, with an average of nearly 30,000 new cases and 735 new deaths per day over the past two weeks, according to health ministry figures.Rio is the Brazilian city hit second-hardest, after economic capital Sao Paulo, with 10,730 deaths.This is the first time it has postponed carnival since 1912.The pandemic had already forced Rio to scrap another tourist magnet, its annual New Year's Eve celebrations on Copacabana beach.The city's economy will likely take a hit from both decisions. Last year, carnival brought 1.5 million tourists to Rio and added 3.8 billion reais (685 million U.S. dollars) to the economy.But many residents said they supported the move."I'm a huge fan of carnival - I go to the 'blocos,' I dance in a samba school. But right now we need to be protecting people, especially the elderly," Carla Mauro, a 52-year-old architect, said on Copacabana."A year with no carnival won't kill anyone."(Cover: Queen of Percussion Raissa Machado of Unidos do Viradouro Samba School performs during the 2020 Rio de Janeiro Carnival champions' parade at the Sapucai Sambadrome on February 29, 2020 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. /CFP)Revelers hoping to escape the coronavirus doldrums at Rio de Janeiro's world-famous carnival got more bad news Friday as organizers indefinitely postponed the city's epic street parties, a day after the official parades were scrapped.Originally scheduled for February 2021, the Brazilian beach city's carnival is a massive mixture of social-distancing no-no's, from the huge crowds that attend the annual samba school parade competition to the giant free-for-all of street parties known as "blocos."After organizers announced Thursday they were indefinitely postponing the samba school parades because of the pandemic, the association responsible for 11 of the biggest "blocos" said it was following suit."The samba school league made the absolutely correct decision.

Last year, carnival brought 1.5 million tourists to Rio and added 3.8 billion reais (685 million U.S. dollars) to the economy.But many residents said they supported the move."I'm a huge fan of carnival - I go to the 'blocos,' I dance in a samba school. But right now we need to be protecting people, especially the elderly," Carla Mauro, a 52-year-old architect, said on Copacabana."A year with no carnival won't kill anyone."(Cover: Queen of Percussion Raissa Machado of Unidos do Viradouro Samba School performs during the 2020 Rio de Janeiro Carnival champions' parade at the Sapucai Sambadrome on February 29, 2020 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. /CFP)The 12th high-level media dialogue between China and South Korea was held on September 25 online.

It drew travelers and traders from far and wide, all with different perspectives on life and eager to learn from others. It was known to be a place where a belief system could truly thrive.  The centuries seem to have passed by in a flash here. Yet, the long passage of time could not totally bury history.  There are ruins of Subash Temple north of the city of Kuqa in southern Xinjiang, highlighting the dominance of the Buddhist religion in these parts."Buddhism came to Qiuci around the 2nd century," illustrated Miao Lihui, chief researcher at Kucha Academy of Xinjiang. "Construction began on Subash in the following century. It was supposed to be the largest temple here. It flourished until the 12th century." "From here, we can see traces of the time when Indian Buddhism was introduced into China, and Chinese Buddhism later spread westward," Miao said. These traces have gone down in history and the evidence is still quite vague.  However, there are stronger claims in the Kizil Buddhist cave temples in neighboring Baicheng County. Miao Lihui has been doing research here for two decades. "The theme of these paintings is closely related to Sakyamuni, and so are the stories. The tales are about Buddha's previous lives and journey in this life. On this dome, there's a painting of the Buddha's life as Prince Sudana is sacrificing his own life to save a family of tigers," Miao explained as he showed us into a cave. These paintings are said to encourage kindness and good deeds. It was actually from Qiuci where Buddhism was introduced to central China.  Qiuci's prince Kumarajiva traveled eastward and translated numerous Buddhist scriptures into the ancient Chinese language in Chang'an, today's Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, until he passed away.  "We see these temples, grottoes and the Buddhists who once lived here and brought Buddhism to Qiuci. Through this, they were able to bridge cultural exchanges between the east and the west and promote world cultural prosperity and development," Miao said. Though in the past centuries, many were stolen and brought to other parts of the world, those that remain are well-preserved and listed as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. They are our window into a time when Buddhism truly flourished in Xinjiang. Over time, Buddhism gradually disappeared from Qiuci, now known as Kuqa. But its legacy remains. It will not quietly turn to ashes and dust, but rather be remembered for generations to come.  Kuqa, a bustling township at the center of the ancient state of Qiuci, used to be a hub for business, culture and thoughts along the ancient Silk Road.

Designers from across the nation have brought their latest ideas to inspire Beijing visitors. Modern design ideas refresh various articles for everyday use, like furniture, costumes, and decorations. How to transmit the country's rich cultural heritage has been a subject much discussed among artists and craftsmen in recent years. Many believe merging ancient with modern in fashion for mass production is the best way. "The Chinese tiger pillow is a mascot inherited from ancient China. It has been considered a symbol of protection of its owner and was commonly used as pillows or sachets. Artist Sanmao uses it in jewelry making. Small and delicate, it's more popular nowadays," said Wu Xu, curator of the traditional products section of the Beijing Design Expo.Drinking tea in nature might be one of the Chinese people's ideals of a perfect moment, and this has inspired artist Akuang in the creation of his space. He uses 999 embroidery frames of different sizes to connect African grass, Hainan horsetail grass, and pine needles, allowing the viewer to see the changing colors of the plants and feel the vitality of nature.Akuang's idea is echoed by Zhao Sumin, whose company grows around 1,500 different kinds of plants. Designing small garden-like spaces is their new business direction, and turns out to be very popular."We hope that every individual can get access to plants in their living space, including home and office. Many people, especially in big cities like Beijing, live under various pressures nowadays. Being in a natural environment is better for our physical and psychological health," said Zhao, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Garden Scape Co. LTD.The relationship between human beings and environment is increasingly under pressure and Atelier Scale Studio's gigantic installation aims to focus on this issue. The installation is formed by more than 800 sunshine boards recycled from plastic bottles. The studio's co-founder Lin Bingxing said, "The crystal like plastic installation is built to raise people's awareness of environmental protection. Visitors are invited to create small parts of it and fill it with empty plastic bottles. The creation will be finished at the end of the expo."As one of the major offline events of this year's Beijing Design Week, the design expo runs through September 26.The 2020 Beijing Design Expo is being held at the National Agricultural Exhibition Center.

Being in a natural environment is better for our physical and psychological health," said Zhao, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Garden Scape Co. LTD.The relationship between human beings and environment is increasingly under pressure and Atelier Scale Studio's gigantic installation aims to focus on this issue. The installation is formed by more than 800 sunshine boards recycled from plastic bottles. The studio's co-founder Lin Bingxing said, "The crystal like plastic installation is built to raise people's awareness of environmental protection. Visitors are invited to create small parts of it and fill it with empty plastic bottles. The creation will be finished at the end of the expo."As one of the major offline events of this year's Beijing Design Week, the design expo runs through September 26.TOP HEADLINESÂ· A European Union leaders summit, scheduled to start on Thursday, has been postponed after European Council President Charles Michel began a period of self-isolation due to contact with an infected security guard.Â· Deaths from COVID-19 in Europe increased by 27 percent week on week as the World Health Organization reported the global infection rate was at its highest level.Â· Madrid authorities have urged the government to hire foreign doctors after a surge in cases across the city. Â·  Spain's government has agreed with labor unions that employers must cover their workers' expenses after the pandemic forced many people across the country to work from home. Â· Belgium has announced that its citizens will no longer have to wear face masks outdoors.

But architects joining the event say they are now paying more attention to adaptability and protecting the environment."When I was designing the International Pavilion of the Beijing Horticultural Expo, for example, I tried everything to minimize the level of environmental disruption.

Some of them are showcased at the exhibition, like "Dougong" - a significant structural element of interlocking wooden brackets. As one of the most important elements in traditional Chinese architecture, it's widely used in large architectural works to connect pillars and columns to the frame of the roof.The two wooden structures exhibited are real-life models of what was used centuries ago. "Dougong" was initially used as wooden support for overhanging roofs, but it later took on a decorative role in important buildings.Protecting ancient legacies and evolving from them have always been important for architects, especially in a country with a history of thousands of years. This issue has been especially addressed in a section that displays young designers' works from 2018 to 2020.The 2020 Beijing Urban and Architecture Biennale runs through October 6 at the Beijing Future Design Park.(Cover: Miniature model of the Great Hall of the People. /CGTN)Urban construction and architectural development have always been an important part of the annual Beijing International Design Week.

Some of them are showcased at the exhibition, like "Dougong" - a significant structural element of interlocking wooden brackets. As one of the most important elements in traditional Chinese architecture, it's widely used in large architectural works to connect pillars and columns to the frame of the roof.The two wooden structures exhibited are real-life models of what was used centuries ago. "Dougong" was initially used as wooden support for overhanging roofs, but it later took on a decorative role in important buildings.Protecting ancient legacies and evolving from them have always been important for architects, especially in a country with a history of thousands of years. This issue has been especially addressed in a section that displays young designers' works from 2018 to 2020.The 2020 Beijing Urban and Architecture Biennale runs through October 6 at the Beijing Future Design Park.(Cover: Miniature model of the Great Hall of the People. /CGTN)Do you know what happened in China last week?

Due to the impact of COVID-19, tourists tend to choose shorter trips in order to spend less time travelling. The recommended routes are meant to tap into local cultural and agricultural resources and boost economic growth. Data by the ministry showed that rural tourism in the country experienced a strong recovery in the second quarter of this year, with the total revenue increasing by nearly 149 percent from 69.5 billion yuan (about 10.3 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, and continued to pick up steam. China celebrates its National Day on October 1 every year.

This number, he said, was 2.6 times higher than the one before the COVID-19 outbreak. These flights have been strengthening the bonds amid the pandemic, he added.The first direct international flight to land in Beijing following the lifting of COVID-19 curbs was that of Air China (CA746). Departing from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, the plane landed at the Beijing Capital International Airport on September 3, signifying the resumption of direct international flights.Resumption of flights in China offers a glimmer of hope for the aviation industry globally. However, travel norms for passengers, especially when it comes to air travel, have changed in ways that were previously unimaginable.New guidelines for air travel As the restrictions are eased, an increasing number of people are choosing air travel to commute domestically. Naturally, airports are not how they used to be.Passengers need to wear masks covering their nose and mouth, and there are signs reminding them to do so everywhere at the airports. Additionally, it is essential to practice social distancing, staying at least 6 feet apart, especially when waiting in line."Most viruses and germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes," according to travel guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Some airline companies have canceled their in-flight meals to decrease touch points onboard, while others are providing passengers with pre-packaged meals only. For example, Delta announced that "customers in all cabins will now receive their own personal snack bags on domestic flights," which include crackers and cookies. Body temperature checks are becoming part of the new airline boarding process, as a fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19, according to CDC and other medical institutions.  A health QR code or health declaration form has become a travel necessity in China after the coronavirus outbreak. Filling in the health code information before landing could save one more time. It's important to check the policies of the destination cities or countries for information, as some regions will require a nucleic acid test for COVID-19 before entry. The number of passengers globally will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024, according to International Air Transport Association.

A member of the university staff was also on the flight to answer questions from students.Zhang Meifang, China's consul general in Belfast and Ian Greer, president and vice-chancellor of Queen's University Belfast, were at Belfast International Airport to welcome the arriving students."Affected by the global pandemic, studying abroad in this year is different from previous years," Zhang said in a welcome speech, adding that the Chinese government attaches great importance to the QUB's charter flight plan."The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, The Civil Aviation Administration of China and other departments have worked closely with our consulate, to actively practice 'diplomacy for the people', to ensure everyone's safety and make their study overseas journey smooth," she said, and also thanked Queen's University for taking the unusual step to show its commitment to students from China.According to Zhang, the charter flight is also the first direct commercial flight from China to Northern Ireland, which marks a milestone in the cultural exchanges between the two sides.Greer said in his welcome message to the Chinese students that he is delighted they have made the journey safely, adding that the university has put in place a comprehensive range of measures, in line with public health guidelines, to ensure the campus is a safe place to live, work, and study."Your teaching will be delivered by a connected learning approach. You will be taught face-to-face with the relevant social distancing and hygiene measures applied at all times, complemented by online classes when necessary," he told the students.There are currently more than 1,000 Chinese students studying at Queen's University Belfast.Alderman Frank McCoubrey, Lord Mayor of Belfast, said in a video to the overseas students that "We understand what a huge decision this must have been to leave your homes and country in the current climate.

A member of the university staff was also on the flight to answer questions from students.Zhang Meifang, China's consul general in Belfast and Ian Greer, president and vice-chancellor of Queen's University Belfast, were at Belfast International Airport to welcome the arriving students."Affected by the global pandemic, studying abroad in this year is different from previous years," Zhang said in a welcome speech, adding that the Chinese government attaches great importance to the QUB's charter flight plan."The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, The Civil Aviation Administration of China and other departments have worked closely with our consulate, to actively practice 'diplomacy for the people', to ensure everyone's safety and make their study overseas journey smooth," she said, and also thanked Queen's University for taking the unusual step to show its commitment to students from China.According to Zhang, the charter flight is also the first direct commercial flight from China to Northern Ireland, which marks a milestone in the cultural exchanges between the two sides.Greer said in his welcome message to the Chinese students that he is delighted they have made the journey safely, adding that the university has put in place a comprehensive range of measures, in line with public health guidelines, to ensure the campus is a safe place to live, work, and study."Your teaching will be delivered by a connected learning approach. You will be taught face-to-face with the relevant social distancing and hygiene measures applied at all times, complemented by online classes when necessary," he told the students.There are currently more than 1,000 Chinese students studying at Queen's University Belfast.Alderman Frank McCoubrey, Lord Mayor of Belfast, said in a video to the overseas students that "We understand what a huge decision this must have been to leave your homes and country in the current climate.

Since the initial launch of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, this railway has become the most popular and convenient way to connect Tibet to the rest of China, bringing tremendous profits to the regions.Dubbed the "sky road" and noted as a man-made wonder in transportation, the 1,956-kilometer-long world-renowned railway begins in Xining and ends in Lhasa. The stunning scenery along the railway offers not only a feast for the eyes, but also a journey for the soul. Come join CGTN to enjoy the enchanting trip on the Qinghai-Tibet train! Qinghai Lake: A paradise for birdwatchers and cyclistsStarting from Xining Railway Station, it takes around one hour to appreciate the stunning view of Qinghai Lake. Dazzling like a crystal-clear gem, Qinghai Lake is the largest inland lake as well as saline lake in China. Surrounded by lofty mountains, the lake features two sub-lakes: a saline Gahai Lake and a freshwater Erhai Lake. Be it the blue sky and water, the green grassland or mesmerizing landscapes â Qinghai Lake boasts great charms worth exploring.Qinghai Lake is definitely a paradise for bird lovers as many different kinds of birds would fly here to breed in May and June due to the mild weather. Meanwhile, for cyclists, cycling around the lake not only allows them to enjoy the beauty of the lake view, but also while away the time.Tips: The best time to visit the Qinghai Lake is from April to August as numerous Cole flowers blossom along the lake during that time, forming breathtaking scenery for visitors. In addition, May and June are the best season for bird watching.Kunlun Mountains: More than just mountainsAs the train keeps moving up, a picturesque view of the Kunlun Mountains appears before you. Reputed as the holy mountains, the Kunlun extend west from the Pamirs with a length of 2,500 kilometers. The 6,178-meter-high Yuzhu Peak is the highest of the Kunlun Mountains in Qinghai. The high peaks are covered with snow and mist all year round, creating a stunning view along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It's worth mentioning that Yuzhu Peak is the first sightseeing station for passengers, which allows them to get off the train and take photos outside. It is considered to be an ideal choice for hiking beginners as its route requires less technique.Hoh Xil Nature Reserve: 'Forbidden zone for humans'Hoh Xil, which means "green mountains" in Mongolian, is a plateau between the Kunlun and Tanggula mountain ranges, with an average altitude of 5,000 meters. Home to many wild animals, including the Tibetan antelope and the wild yak, Hoh Xil Nature Reserve is undoubtedly a desolate region in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The extensive area of alpine mountains and steppe systems is situated more than 4,500 meters above sea level, where sub-zero average temperatures prevail all year round. The geographic and harsh climatic conditions have made this place a "forbidden zone for humans," which is also a reason for its biodiversity. This is probably one of the few places left on Earth where one could get off the beaten track and find inner peace.  Tips:  As there are no signs in Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, visitors often get lost here. Remember to bring a local guide with you or rent a car to travel. Tsonag Lake: A 'soul lake' for TibetansLying in Amdo County, Nagqu Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tsonag Lake is one of the most significant holy lakes to local residents.  The Qinghai-Tibet railway passes right by the lake, making it the closest altiplano lake to the railway on the road. Passengers can take photos and capture the charming view of the lake as they would definitely have something to brag about on social media.Lhasa: The start of the journey to TibetThe final destination of the Qinghai-Tibet train trip â Lhasa, offers almost every aspect of Tibetan culture. If one must pick a name card for Lhasa, the Potala Palace is very likely to be the answer. No one can really say that he/she has visited Lhasa unless they have been to the Potala Palace â a must-see for travelers from home and abroad. Tibet is always full of incredible scenery. In early March when most of the plateau is still tinged with a wintry chill, Nyingchi Prefecture, in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, is blanketed with pink blossoms. If you want to record all the scenery along the sky road, seeing them yourself is not enough. The feelings from the bottom of your heart are important. So, what are you still waiting for? It's time to pack your bag and start the soul journey to Tibet where you could completely hand over yourself to nature and experience the unique Tibetan culture.  For centuries, Tibet has not been explored as much by the outside world due to its remote location, extreme climate and geographic environment.

At a themed forum on Thursday, big names from the country's streaming services gathered to discuss how to produce documentaries that appeal to Generation Z.   When it comes to documentaries, many people think of educational films or series that are too dry to keep viewers' attention.  However for streaming services like Bilibili, Youku and iQiyi, documentaries are the best way to win over viewers, especially the younger ones, if you know what really speaks to them.  As part of the themed forum at this year's Beijing Documentary Week, representatives from these companies have come to share their stories at the China Millennium Monument Museum.  Bilibili, which started as ACG video platform, has a track record of success with younger generations like Gen Z in distributing documentaries in recent years.  Previous hit series on the platform include "The Story of CHUAN'ER" the popular grilled kebabs, which has been viewed over 200 million times through the first two seasons.  Zhu Xiangliang, senior adviser at the Documentary Department of Bilibili, told CGTN, "The documentaries distributed via new media platforms offer more interaction between the audience and the production team than ever before. For example, some viewers would make stickers or render clips of our documentaries in new ways, and these would bring more attention to the series. It's a positive succession."Zhu revealed that young viewers are equally attracted to themes like history and traditional crafts, contrary to conventional thinking.  A good example is Bilibili's two-season documentary which has taken a different angle on historic figures, like bringing the gourmet side of poet Su Shi. And technology also helps to bring a fresh perspective and a modern approach to documentaries. Zhang Wei, director of Youku Documentary Center, explained, "Creative storytelling methods like what we did with The Legend Hunters can give documentaries a new look to hook the younger generation. Mini mobile games are mixed into The Legend Hunters as a way to explain archaeological methodology and the science relevant to this site. In the near future we might see more interactive documentaries or even ones specifically designed for vertical screens." Beijing Documentary Week will also see the release of quality documentaries and themed screenings.  It runs till Tuesday, September 22. The fourth edition of Beijing Documentary Week which kicked off Tuesday is in full swing, bringing 54 selected documentaries and a series of exhibitions, seminars and cultural events to the capital.

And it's been practiced by some of the greats in European art. From German Renaissance figure DÃ¼rer to French impressionist Monet and even modernists Picasso and Matisse. The origins of copperplate etching can be traced back to Medieval Europe. An image is drawn on a copperplate then transferred onto paper using a printing press. The traditional method has evolved over centuries into an art form in its own right.Yang Hui, curator of Changyang Art Museum, said: "These copperplate prints are small and delicate. They are quite different from Chinese paintings, which are grand and magnificent. This exhibit gives people here in Beijing a chance to closely feel the charm of European art." Copper-plate etching arrived in China during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) by way of European missionaries and gained popularity during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), winning the emperor's favor in Emperor Qianlong's reign. Today, copperplate etching has become a form of cultural exchange between China and France. Guo Renzhi, a Beijing resident viewed the exhibition, said, "I'm in awe. The pieces are very detailed. The themes are colorful, even the ones on human figures and landscapes. The depictions are meticulous. When you look carefully, you'll see they're so vivid. Even if it's in black and white, you can still see how the brightness changes." The exhibit runs through October. An exhibition of French copperplate etching is underway in the Chinese capital, featuring collections from Li Keran Academy of Painting.  Over 200 copperplate prints on show from the Palace of Versailles use a technique that has a history of nearly 600 years and requires a certain degree of skill.

France, however, was still in a tough battle against the epidemic at that time. Both countries have overcome many difficulties to hold the exhibition, she added.At the exhibition is an innovative, immersive space that allows visitors to explore the origin and background stories about "Impression, Sunrise" via video clips and projections.It also holds a crossover collaboration with Team Wang, a home-grown streetwear label by Chinese pop star Jackson Wang, featuring a conceptual display space, "TEAM WANGÃMONET," on the third floor of the Bund One Art Museum, where the famous painting embraces a new interpretation and incorporates the images of landmarks in Shanghai and Paris like the Oriental Pearl Tower and Eiffel Tower.One of the greatest painters of the 20th century, Monet is a founder of French Impressionist painting and an unswerving advocate of the Impressionist style. His masterwork "Impression, Sunrise," which was created from a scene in the port of northwestern French city Le Havre, is credited with inspiring the name of the Impressionist movement.The exhibition will run through January 3, 2021.(Cover: A poster for the Claude Monet exhibition at the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai, China. /ambafrance.org)Groundbreaking artwork "Impression, Sunrise" by legendary French painter Claude Monet (1840-1926) made its China debut nearly 150 years after it was first shown at a Paris exhibition, stunning the world of art.Monet's 1872 masterpiece was unveiled on Wednesday at the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai, while a special exhibition in honor of the French impressionist painter takes place from Thursday, September 17, where Chinese viewers can have a close look at some of Monet's classics.In addition to the world-famed "Impression, Sunrise," the exhibition is showcasing a total of 47 French paintings, including nine of Monet's masterworks collected in the Marmottan Monet Museum in Paris, such as "Charing Cross Bridge, Smoke in the Fog" (1902) and "Sailing Boat, Evening Effect" (1885).The sunrise symbolizes new birth and hope, which seems more meaningful than ever since people are facing the COVID-19 pandemic, said Marianne Mathieu, the Marmottan's curatorial director.Myriam Kryger, cultural attache of the French consulate general in Shanghai, said the idea to exhibit "Impression, Sunrise" in China started around April as prevention and control measures in China began producing positive results.

That is the traditional culture of the Yi people," said Fan Chengyuan, head of Xianrendong, a village tucked away in southwest China's Yunnan Province.Xianrendong, which means "fairy cave" in Chinese, was plagued by extreme poverty for a very long time. In the 1990s, it was nicknamed the "Pocket Village" because of people's dire living conditions. Villagers largely relied on growing crops and fishing for a living and their average annual income was only 300 yuan (44 U.S. dollars) â approximately one-eighth of the national poverty line which is 2,300 yuan (339 U.S. dollars).Things have changed since. In 2019, per capita income jumped to 40,000 yuan (5,902 U.S. dollars) on average, making the village the richest in Qiubei County.Developing rural tourism with ethnic elementsThe nearby scenic spot of Puzhehei first started developing its tourism sector in the 1990s. As changes began to set in, people in the surrounding villages slowly started to see tourism as a viable method for escaping poverty as well.Home to 196 households, Xianrendong is inhabited by Yi people â one of the largest ethnic minority groups in China. It also boasts clear lakes and lush vegetation, offering abundant tourism resources.Seeing the potential business opportunity, Fan quit his previous job in the county and returned to the village in 2005. He then took out a bank loan to renovate old houses and convert them into homestay properties with traditional ethnic Yi style.Keeping local traditions and ethnic culture alive has become key to the village's tourism development. Fan said they studied the traditional architectural styles and upgraded the designs to make the houses more habitable and comfortable. Since 2013, yellow-brick cottages of two or three stories have sprung up across the village. They also revived traditional customs and events, ethnic handicrafts as well as folk songs and dances. During special occasions, the resident art troupe would stage singing and dancing performances around the bonfire, presenting a cultural feast for the visitors. This return to traditional culture has successfully brought a boon to the once impoverished village.As the village rose to fame and popularity, more job opportunities followed, covering the industries of agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, catering, accommodation and others. Today, many young people have returned home to start their own businesses.Last year, 5.85 million trips by domestic and foreign visitors were made to the Puzhehei scenic spot, bringing in 5.25 billion yuan (775 million U.S. dollars) in tourism revenue.(Cover image designed by Du Chenxin)"The development of rural tourism cannot come at the expense of [a place's] essence.

The group acquired the brand and online assets of the UK company last November and for the relaunch of the new company it will retain the brand's familiar "Sunny Heart" logo.  In a statement, the new Thomas Cook said it was "COVID-19 ready," and will initially sell holidays to destinations on the UK government's safe travel corridor list including Italy, Greece and Turkey via its new website.Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 and was the world's oldest travel firm until it went bankrupt in September 2019, six months before the COVID-19 pandemic caused chaos for the travel industry. â¢ Fauchon fermÃ©?

Now, with more exhibits dusting display cases and opening their doors again, a trip to the museum comes with mandatory mask-wearing and body temperature checks, hand sanitizer stations, social distancing markers and limits on visitor numbers. In the spirit of adapting to the new normal, museums have turned to the virtual space and museum patrons have warmed up to appreciating artwork from the comfort of their living room.This month, 16 museum curators from around the world sifted through their collections to choose their most favorite relics and shared them with a global audience in a nine-day art galore, which also featured discussions about the most pressing issues facing museums during these extraordinary times.The "Treasure Hunt Relay: Global Museum Director's Choice," which ran from September 6 to 15, was an initiative by The National Museum of China to help art lovers experience the power of culture wherever they were. The museum collaborated with 15 other cultural institutions across five continents to display prized artifacts and share the exciting history behind them, while weighing in on the opportunities and obstacles brought about by COVID-19.Every day, two curators held online presentations, revealing some of the cultural objects closest to their hearts. The relay began with the Beijing-based host museum and ended with the British Museum on Monday.About 90 percent of the museums worldwide were forced to temporarily shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak, and 13 percent could have their doors permanently closed, according to a May report jointly released by the UNESCO and International Council of Museums.The National Museum of China, for example, closed for 100 days before reopening on May 1, and currently caps the number of daily visitors at 8,000.In countries that rely heavily on tourism, the impact is even bigger. The number of visitors to the National Museum of Slovenia is now about 25 percent of that of last year. The Singapore-based Asian Civilizations Museum, which normally sees an average of 2,000 guests a day, is registering just 5 percent of the usual flow after reopening in June.The internet provided a way out for museums, which moved their exhibits and activities online in search of viable alternatives, with technology playing an important role in the conceptualization of fresh projects.The National Museum of China launched dozens of virtual exhibitions, including the first virtual exhibition on Chinese aerospace achievements, and a number of digital courses. The National Museum in Warsaw launched an app called Selfie, which allowed people to take pictures of their favorite works of art and upload them online. Meanwhile, the National Museum of Korea modified existing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) projects and moved them online."These opportunities also get the public to tell us how they were experiencing the pandemic. These things in their own right will become important documents telling the story of how people coped with this age," said Dr. Mathew Trinca, curator of the National Museum of Australia.As palaces for sheltering human civilization, connecting the past, present and future, "museums are important at this time because they sustain our people and give them a sense of hope and optimism, drawn from the study of experiences of people in the past," said Trinca."I think this is important for us now to know how human beings are resilient and [how] we've overcome obstacles like these in our shared long history on earth," he added.Marriage of cultures"Virtual space, cloud exhibition and live broadcast can reach beyond the limits of time and space, so that audiences from all over the world can understand our museums, enjoy the exquisite collections of the museums, and appreciate the brilliance and splendor of different civilizations," said Dr. Wang Chunfa, curator of the National Museum of China, during the relay's opening presentation.The rich collections of the U.S.-based Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art is an example of the convergence of cultures. Dr. Chase F. Robinson, the curator, introduced two Chinese relics, the Square Ritual Food Cauldron (Fangding) from the 3,000-year-old Western Zhou period and the scroll "Nymph of the Luohe River" traditionally attributed to Chinese painter Gu Kaizhi who lived some 1,600 years ago."Just like the Silk Road connected East Asia with the near east of the Mediterranean world, we now live in a world in which we can recreate the Silk Road with some optical fibers. So optical fibers are now connecting East and West," said Robinson when referring to the "Treasure Hunt Relay" project.The National Museum of the Sultanate of Oman also shared their appreciation to the Chinese culture, showing three Ming-Dynasty bowls, which attests to the long-lasting relationship and sea trade on the maritime Silk Road that connected Oman and China."Today we are witnessing the idea of a global world coming under increased reassessment, criticism, and scrutiny. We see nationalism become stronger again and perhaps a certain tendency of countries isolating themselves from others. I believe strongly that this movement, which comes way out of the past of an ever-growing connection globally, is irreversible," said Dr. Hartwig Fischer, curator of the British Museum.Fischer said that the possibility of working with the National Museum of China is a huge chance with an impact on the development of globalization. "What we are able to show is that there are many interconnections of cultures that have driven the development of humankind," he said.An afternoon in a museum is not what it used to be â but that's not necessarily an awful thing.For most of the first half of the year, killing time musing over paintings and sculptures was an unthinkable activity amid coronavirus lockdown restrictions and stay-at-home orders.

Here, silk isn't just a luxury fabric; it's a way of life. The fine, delicately-patterned silk fabrics that were once the exclusive preserve of emperors are being reinvented for a mass market in the modern era. But does today's multi-billion-dollar industry owe its existence to the Chinese imperial family? No! It's thanks to the humble silkworm, which is at the heart of a lengthy process that depends on two key factors; preventing the moth from hatching from the cocoon, and perfecting the silkworms' diet. Only then, as you will see in the video, can the "ancient 3D printer" produce perfect silk thread. For more fascinating tales from China, follow us on @cgtntravelogue on Facebook and Instagram.Known as the "Home of Silk," Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province has a history of silk-making that dates back over 4,700 years.

Some of the exhibits have been displayed for the first time.Since its completion in 1420, the Forbidden City served as the imperial palace of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) Dynasties, with 24 emperors living and ruling there. It stands today as the concentrated embodiment of thought about urban planning and palace construction in ancient China.Exhibition explores the Forbidden City's past 600 yearsFollowing the timeline, the exhibition has been divided into three parts with 18 major historical events. The first part explains why the Forbidden City was planned and laid out as it is through the relationship between the imperial palace and the capital city.The second part, "Inclusiveness," focuses on the Forbidden City's look in ethnic elements after it was taken over by ethnic Manchu ruler during the Qing Dynasty and Western architectural style after the 18th century.The third part shows how the imperial palace was given new vitality after becoming a public museum and World Heritage Site and welcoming visitors both from home and abroad."The Forbidden City has a cultural foundation of several thousands of years, and architectural basis on the traditions of the Tang and Song Dynasties before evolving into its today's form," said Ren Wanping, deputy director of the Palace Museum and the general curator of the exhibition."I hope visitors perceive that the Forbidden City contains Chinese philosophical thought and humanistic spirit from our ceaseless culture passed down from generation to generation," she added.Rarely-seen cultural relics exhibitedThe exhibition displays many rarely-seen cultural relics, including the Empress's Winter Court Coronet used on her wedding day and the Jewel-inlaid Gold Cup with "Jin'ou youngu" (Everlasting Territory) Inscription used by the emperor on Chinese New Year's Eve.The ten Glazed Animal Ornaments, which stand together only on the eaves of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the largest and highest-level building in the Forbidden City, have been displayed together for the first time.

British and French forces destroyed the place on October 18 and 19, 1860, during the Second Opium War, a move to force China to open its market.A special activity marks 160th anniversaryIn order to allow visitors to explore the Old Summer Palace more deeply, the park has launched the "Old Summer Palace Passport," which can be purchased at stores in the park or at Tmall and JD.com stores. There are 51 classic attractions of the Old Summer Palace on this "passport." Visitors can find the seals from shops near the corresponding attractions on the map on the front page of the passport.After collecting all 51 seals, one from each attraction, visitors can get a special seal. "This seal is the symbol of treasure coming into and going out of the Old Summer Palace. Completing the seal collection is like bringing the Old Summer Palace home," said a personnel who works at the park.According to officials, each seal has been custom-made for the 160th anniversary of the massive loot.Will the Old Summer Palace be rebuilt?As many as 160 years ago, the Old Summer Palace, known as the "garden of gardens," was looted and burned down by Western powers. Numerous treasures disappeared and the famous garden was gradually abandoned. Later, the Old Summer Palace was turned into a park, but it remained as it was when it was destroyed. As the restoration work continues, some experts and scholars say the Old Summer Palace needs a museum to store items that behold precious historical memories. What is the fate of the cultural relics? Should we keep it original or restore it? Experts and scholars have different views on this.Experts estimate that millions of looted cultural relics are scattered around the world and China, and the ones in the country are mainly concentrated in Beijing. Since the establishment of the management office of the Old Summer Palace in 1976, experts and scholars have been trying to trace the lost relics. Nowadays, access to information is expanding, providing more clues for finding cultural relics.In September 2007, Macao gaming tycoon Stanley Ho Hung-sun purchased the bronze statue of the horse head of Yuanmingyuan at a price of HK$69.1 million. Twelve years later, as a gift to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the 20th anniversary of Macao's return to the motherland, he donated the statue to the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, hoping that it would return to where it belongs â the Old Summer Palace.Read more: Remembering History: Horse-head statue returns to Old Summer PalaceThe good news is the horse head could go home, but it was difficult to find a suitable place to put it, an embarrassment that made the management of the Old Summer Palace realize once again that the palace should have a museum of a certain size.However, Zhang Bai, former deputy director of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, said the Old Summer Palace site differs from other sites in that it bears a historical pain that the Chinese people will never forget, which is an important part of what the place should show.As CCTV News reported, there have always been different opinions among experts and scholars on the discussion of the Old Summer Palace. There have always been two completely different views: keeping the original appearance and reflecting the history of the changes; and restoring its glory as it was in its heyday.The Old Summer Palace management office, at the center of the controversy, has been trying to explore this issue. For example, in recent years, the management office of the Old Summer Palace rebuilt the palace gate of the Garden of Eternal Spring and the Garden of Elegant Spring. The Palace Gate site, the largest and most ornate entrance into the complex, is also being excavated and restored since 2019.Read more: Old Summer Palace gate area being restoredWith more and more relics unearthed and returned to the palace, the administration has again submitted an application to the relevant authorities, hoping to push forward the construction of the museum, CCTV News reported.The park is located near China's two most prestigious universities â Tsinghua University and Peking University â as well as Zhongguancun, known as "China's Silicon Valley."

They have special visas that allow them to stay for 90 days with the option to renew twice. The first 14 days have to be spent in quarantine.Among other stipulations, they also need to have proof of travel insurance and medical insurance for in and outpatient treatment, as well as for treatment for COVID-19.After landing, their papers were checked, and their temperatures were taken before they were allowed through immigration. In all, they had to pass through three thermoscans as they walked through the airport, according to airport authorities. As they queued to board buses, workers in protective clothing disinfected their luggage."We can assure everyone that all our measures are systematic and meet international standards," said the airport's deputy general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn.Chinese tourists were seen putting on raincoats as the last step before leaving for their quarantine accommodation. Kittipong said this was not a government requirement, but rather, he said, the raincoats appeared to have been part of a complimentary package of items from their hotel.Almost 40 million people visited Thailand in 2019, with tourism accounting for more than 10 percent of the country's GDP. But the halting of international flights in early April, due to the pandemic, has left the sector in dire straits. Well-known tourist spots, used to hordes of visitors, are now almost empty, as are the country's famous sandy beaches.More flights are scheduled for tourists on special visas in the coming weeks.(Cover: Chinese tourists from Shanghai arrive at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, October 20, 2020. /AP)Si Qiang, literally "four tunes," is a form of folk music that reflect the social and romantic activities of the young men and women from the Yi ethnic group, which is spread across Eshan Yi Autonomous County, southwest China's Yunnan Province.As a vital part of Yi folk music, it was included in the Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection List of Yunnan Province in 2013.As the name suggests, Si Qiang have four singing tunes, which are distinctive but can be repeated in the same song.

But such requirements have drawn criticism from a minority that has complained of having their liberty suppressed."In those situations where a customer declines to wear a face covering, we'll put in place additional procedures to take care of them in a friendly, expedited way," McDonald's said, adding that it will help its employees get training "to ensure they are prepared to address this new policy in a friendly and positive way."Customers who come into a McDonald's restaurant without a mask will be offered one by a worker, a McDonald's representative told NPR.

The government offered $78.3 million to the local authority as support for local businesses, which have to close during the lockdowns, while Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, a former Labour minister, asked for $84.8 million.Neither side could agree and on Friday a local shutdown will start with some financial support, as the government is fire-fighting an increase in COVID-19 and trying to avoid the economic and political fallout of a second national lockdown.Wales and Northern Ireland will both begin a two-week and a four-week lockdown respectively on Friday â decisions taken by the devolved governments in Cardiff and Belfast.Toni Waterman in BrusselsBelgium's new testing strategy â of not testing people without symptoms even if they've been in close contact with someone who tests positive â starts today. It's been criticized by some, but the government says it's necessary to reduce long lines at testing facilities and to ease the pressure on labs.

Pubs and bars will close temporarily and socializing prohibited indoors, but universities and retail shops will stay open.High level measures will be applied to Manchester and Nottinghamshire, meaning socializing indoors will be banned and the rule of six applied in outdoor settings, but pubs and bars will be allowed to stay open, as across the rest of the country, until 10 p.m.  Those areas placed on the medium tier will continue to follow national guidelines, with bars and pubs closing at 10 p.m. and the rule of six applied outdoors.The UK government response is for England only, with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland implementing their own strategies to deal with the pandemic.Johnson says the new system is designed to avoid another national lockdown, which he says would cause long-term economic damage."This is not how we want to live our lives," he said. "But it is the narrow path we have to tread between the social and economic costs of a full lockdown and the massive human and, indeed, economic cost of an uncontained epidemic."  Johnson added: "The weeks and months ahead will continue to be difficult and will test the mettle of this country. I have no doubt at all that together we will succeed."The prime minister and his scientific advisers will continue to monitor the number of cases in each area, which could lead to an increasing number of towns and cities facing the most severe measures.England's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jonathan Van-Tam explained why cases of COVID-19 have risen so sharply the north of England compared with the rest of the country. "The epidemic this time has clearly picked up pace in the north of England earlier than it did in the first wave and that almost certainly relates to the fact that disease levels in the north never dropped, and certainly in the northwest, they never dropped as far as they dropped in the summer as they did in the south."Johnson also announced a further economic package would be introduced to replace the furlough scheme, which comes to an end at the end of this month. The support will cover two-thirds of the wages for employees of businesses forced to close as a result of the new virus restrictions.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced a new three-level COVID-19 alert system across England as cases continue to rise across the country.Infection rates have quadrupled in England in the past month, and hospital admissions have doubled. The new system will apply localized measures of varying severity to the worst-hit areas of the country, with regions placed into one of three levels â medium, high or very high. Liverpool has been placed in the very high level with measures set to be imposed from Wednesday.

Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home. Jason Huth, an English teacher in Beijing, was one who decided not to travel during the holiday. "I chose to stay for a few reasons; partly because I had just got back to Beijing a few weeks ago after being stuck abroad since Chinese New Year, partly because my school strongly advised teachers not to travel too far away from Beijing due to fears of having to quarantine upon return."Many international schools and companies advised staff against travel during the break. Aletta Magrieta Strauss, a Beijing-based art teacher, said she thought this was reasonable. "If there was an outbreak and I had to quarantine as a result, work would not cover the cost. They (international schools) have already lost a lot of money and are still trying to get staff back into China."With many people having extra money to spend due to not traveling earlier in the year, and with the onus being on safety and comfort, high-end hotels saw a boom in business. Of all hotel bookings made on Trip.com during the October holiday, four- and five-star accommodation accounted for nearly half. It's anticipated that the effect will be lasting, as more people get used to the idea of "luxury staycations."This year's October holiday saw a resurgence in domestic tourism, with 637 million trips being recorded in eight days. Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home.

newspaper, the 11 countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than three months also being eligible.Eligible travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 before entering Japan and upon arrival in Japan, while their sponsors, such as companies or organizations which support them, will be expected to ensure their self-isolation for 14 days, during which time they will not be allowed to use public transport.The government had said it would consider permitting 1,000 foreigners into the country per day, mainly to accommodate those who intend to stay for three months or longer, while looking to increasing the cap in the months ahead.Foreigners with resident status here who had been overseas have recently been allowed to re-enter the county, while expatriates and other long-term residents from some Asian countries have also been granted access into the country.These include those from Vietnam, Thailand and a number of other economies with which reciprocal agreements have been made.The Japanese government has more recently made similar reciprocal agreements with Singapore and Brunei.Currently, people from 159 countries and regions have been denied entry to the country, but Japan has steadily been easing its entry restrictions. (Cover: Japan. /CFP) Japan is reportedly planning to ease travel restrictions to China and

have also been granted access into the country.These include those from Vietnam, Thailand and a number of other economies with which reciprocal agreements have been made.The Japanese government has

that's all over after British Airways retired the fleet.It's easy to blame this on the COVID-19 pandemic, but truth be told, the 747 has had its day. Four fuel-guzzling engines have been replaced by two, and modern technology has left this massive people-carrier behind.But as with so many things in this pandemic, the inevitable has been accelerated â and this is still an industry gasping for survival.  On Wednesday evening, the UK's transport secretary, Grant Shapps, took to social media to reassure the aviation sector that it hadn't been forgotten.He tweeted: "We are moving ahead with the next step to reduce the travel quarantine period by launching the Global Travel Taskforce to open up international travel and boost our businesses."The task force will implement a testing regime to reduce the self-isolation period, along with a wide range of other measures to enable travel while keeping down infection rates.What everyone wants to see is quicker testing at the airports. So passengers can quickly verify their state of health and therefore avoid the exhaustive quarantine measures that have prevented passengers from bothering traveling.Currently under limited trial in Asia are digital health passports. A record for passengers who have taken a test within 72 hours to ensure a safe passage through international security.  The trial moves to the UK and Europe next week.The government's COVID-19 "safe list" of countries grows shorter by the day and gradually across the globe moments of access are being closed off again as much of the world braces itself for the second wave most knew would come but somehow hoped to avoid.Low-cost airline easyJet is now forecasting more than $1 billion in losses this year, confounding even pessimistic analysts' predictions.So far, the company has borrowed in the region of $800 million from the government, sold off aircraft and cut 4,500 jobs.Still it's calling for more action from the government.The airline says it will fly just 25 percent of its planned capacity for the rest of this year, behind rival Ryanair, which is aiming for 40 percent in October. The lumbering bulk of a Boeing 747 jumbo jet accelerating through the rain at London's Heathrow Airport has been a familiar sight since 1971 â but that's all over after British Airways retired the fleet.It's easy to blame this on the COVID-19 pandemic, but truth be told, the 747 has had its day.

But he says driving bullet trains is very different, and much better."Diesel and electric locomotives don't seal properly. Sand still gets inside, even when the windows are closed," Chen said. He had to clean up the sand or it could have damaged the control desk and other devices in the cabin."Now bullet trains are wind and sand proof. So I can focus on my work, safely taking passengers to their destinations," he added.Xinjiang's first high-speed rail line officially opened in November 2014, connecting the region's capital city Urumqi with Hami, a city in east Xinjiang. The 530-kilometer trip used to take 4-6 hours. Today, it takes only 2.5 hours. Traveling by bullet train has now become a new way of life for the locals.Despite the transformation that high-speed railway has brought to the city, for Chen, one thing hasn't changed. That is the sense of responsibility."No matter what kind of locomotives you're driving, you should stick to your sense of responsibility. You should be responsible for yourself, your passengers, as well as the state property," he told CGTN.Chen has witnessed the railway's development in Xinjiang, from diesel locomotives to electric, and now bullet trains. What impressed him the most are the greater levels of efficiency as well as the working environment.The speed limit for trains in Xinjiang is now two times higher than before and Chen believes it'll be three times faster in the foreseeable future.The bullet train is changing people's way of life in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and boosting the region's economic potential. It took only 3 years to build, and first went into operation 6 years ago.Chen Xin felt curious and excited when he first boarded a bullet train 6 years ago. He still remembers the day he got into a bullet train cab for the first time. He wasn't allowed to touch the control desk because his teacher was afraid that he might do something wrong and force the train to stop.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

In its holds we discovered military vehicles, porcelain and many crates with contents still unknown."The Karlsruhe had been taking part in Operation Hannibal, one of the largest sea evacuations in history, which helped more than one million German troops and civilians from East Prussia escape the Soviet advance towards the end of World War II.  Documentation from the time suggests the boat left Koenigsberg in a hurry, with a large cargo and 1,083 people onboard."All this, put together, stimulates the human imagination.

They were already down about 80 percent this year, due to the impact of the pandemic on the entertainment industry.  The company reopened its UK cinemas in July but customers numbers have been small since then.Cineworld's CEO, Moody Greidinger, said it was "not a decision we made lightly.""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings," he added. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time."Greidinger's statement also highlighted the challenges the firm faced in getting studios to release new movies.  Cineworld was hoping the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, could help turn around its fortunes. But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added. The world's second largest cinema chain, Cineworld, is temporarily shutting its theaters in the U.S. and the UK.The move is due to low footfall as a result of COVID-19 and puts 45,000 jobs at risk, including 5,500 in the UK.Cineworld's shares in London plunged more than 50 percent at one stage on Monday.

He's been in this occupation for seven years so far, the period of which, nonetheless, is just a fraction of that of his father and grandfather.The apple doesn't fall far from the treeThe story began in 1958 when his grandfather Li Wangfu, a native of east China's Shandong, went from Dandong Railway Bureau to Xining on a job transfer. "I arrived here on August 15, 1958," Li Wangfu told CGTN. In his 80s, he still remembers the date clearly. After a long bumpy ride, what appeared before his eyes was a barren land where the sun blazed down straight.When the Xining railway depot was set up in October 1959, Li Wangfu became one of the few train inspectors on the sparsely populated plateau. Back then, he hunted troubles and made overhauls with a slew of clumsy tools in the daytime and lived in a cellar, which he and his colleagues dug by themselves, on a dust hill just south to the garage of the station, at night."At that time, we went to wherever they needed us," he said. Every day he went off work with his coats soaked in black engine oil. Hard work paid off. He became one of the first train inspection chiefs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1984 â the year when the railroad linking Xining and Golmud, respectively the first and second largest city of Qinghai Province, started operation.Like father, like son. Li Xiujin's foray into train maintenance was hugely impacted by his father Li Wangfu. "My father once took me on his train, I felt it was really a good job," he recalled. In 1983, he was assigned to the Golmud Depot. "Back then, it took us over two days to travel from Xining to Golmud, where sands and pebbles were flying around."Li Xiujin and his colleagues lived in a small, drafty mud hut and carried repair hammers along with them to work every day. Over the past 37 years, he witnessed the booming development of railway technologies, which has largely facilitated train inspection.The Qinghai railway system introduced an array of automatic detecting machines in 2012, amid a nationwide tech-driven development momentum. Li Xiujin learned state-of-the-art technology and became a TFDS (Train of Freight Failures Detection System) centralized analyst. "Now I can check around 300 trains every day on computer."Repair and maintenance work used to rely more on experience but now "comprehensive skills" based on technical know-how are also required to guarantee the safety of passengers, according to third-generation Li Haifeng.From steam locomotives to electric trainsIn the 1950s and 1960s, what the train offered was a bottom-rattling, days-long ride â that was the era when steam reigned railroads. Steam locomotives helped thrust the world into the first industrial revolution and have since forged ahead the human civilization for the next 150 years.In China, the production and use of steam locomotives continued into the late 1980s though most of them were phased out at a much earlier time. In the 1960s, steam trains led the development of the country's railroad networks, driving its socio-economic development.Li Wangfu witnessed the antiques being gradually sifted out and the debut of internal combustion trains and then electric trains. "We're all electrified now."Over the past decades, China's train technology is all but obsolete. His son and grandson saw more unfathomable developments. "Previously on the Xining-Golmud section, the train ran at merely some 50 kilometers per hour, but now it could reach 160 kilometers," noted Li Haifeng.Now China has the world's biggest high-speed railway network, along with advanced inspecting methods for the facilities and equipment on the train."We have switched from heavy manual labor to mental work, just like a physician in a hospital," said Li Xiujin, "We just sit indoors, watch pictures taken by high-speed cameras, and report problems to on-site inspectors with the help of TFDS."For Li Haifeng, the work is much less laborious but requires more expertise. The train he works on has a UV filter inbuilt in its window, oxygen generators, and automatic excrement processing devices amid a variety of new facilities."Working on the train is tough, as you need to take into account the safety of every passenger. It's like being a 'doctor' who knows everything about the train and gives the right prescription," Li Haifeng said.Video director: Yu YingtianCameraman: Guo YuanhengText by Wang XiaonanCopy editor: Oscar MargainVoiceover: Sim Sim WissgottProduction assistant: Yu WenwenProducer: Zhang XiaoheSupervisor: Zhang Shilei"I'm continuing the dream of my father and grandfather," said Li Haifeng, a train inspector at the Xining Depot â the place where the trains on the Qinghai-Tibet Railway blew their first whistle.Thirty-one-year-old Li has been investigating and troubleshooting undetected faults in the facilities of each coach to ensure the safety of every train journey. He's been in this occupation for seven years so far, the period of which, nonetheless, is just a fraction of that of his father and grandfather.The apple doesn't fall far from the treeThe story began in 1958 when his grandfather Li Wangfu, a native of east China's Shandong, went from Dandong Railway Bureau to Xining on a job transfer. "I arrived here on August 15, 1958," Li Wangfu told CGTN. In his 80s, he still remembers the date clearly. After a long bumpy ride, what appeared before his eyes was a barren land where the sun blazed down straight.When the Xining railway depot was set up in October 1959, Li Wangfu became one of the few train inspectors on the sparsely populated plateau. Back then, he hunted troubles and made overhauls with a slew of clumsy tools in the daytime and lived in a cellar, which he and his colleagues dug by themselves, on a dust hill just south to the garage of the station, at night."At that time, we went to wherever they needed us," he said. Every day he went off work with his coats soaked in black engine oil. Hard work paid off. He became one of the first train inspection chiefs on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 1984 â the year when the railroad linking Xining and Golmud, respectively the first and second largest city of Qinghai Province, started operation.Like father, like son. Li Xiujin's foray into train maintenance was hugely impacted by his father Li Wangfu. "My father once took me on his train, I felt it was really a good job," he recalled. In 1983, he was assigned to the Golmud Depot. "Back then, it took us over two days to travel from Xining to Golmud, where sands and pebbles were flying around."Li Xiujin and his colleagues lived in a small, drafty mud hut and carried repair hammers along with them to work every day. Over the past 37 years, he witnessed the booming development of railway technologies, which has largely facilitated train inspection.The Qinghai railway system introduced an array of automatic detecting machines in 2012, amid a nationwide tech-driven development momentum. Li Xiujin learned state-of-the-art technology and became a TFDS (Train of Freight Failures Detection System) centralized analyst. "Now I can check around 300 trains every day on computer."Repair and maintenance work used to rely more on experience but now "comprehensive skills" based on technical know-how are also required to guarantee the safety of passengers, according to third-generation Li Haifeng.From steam locomotives to electric trainsIn the 1950s and 1960s, what the train offered was a bottom-rattling, days-long ride â that was the era when steam reigned railroads. Steam locomotives helped thrust the world into the first industrial revolution and have since forged ahead the human civilization for the next 150 years.In China, the production and use of steam locomotives continued into the late 1980s though most of them were phased out at a much earlier time. In the 1960s, steam trains led the development of the country's railroad networks, driving its socio-economic development.Li Wangfu witnessed the antiques being gradually sifted out and the debut of internal combustion trains and then electric trains. "We're all electrified now."Over the past decades, China's train technology is all but obsolete. His son and grandson saw more unfathomable developments. "Previously on the Xining-Golmud section, the train ran at merely some 50 kilometers per hour, but now it could reach 160 kilometers," noted Li Haifeng.Now China has the world's biggest high-speed railway network, along with advanced inspecting methods for the facilities and equipment on the train."We have switched from heavy manual labor to mental work, just like a physician in a hospital," said Li Xiujin, "We just sit indoors, watch pictures taken by high-speed cameras, and report problems to on-site inspectors with the help of TFDS."For Li Haifeng, the work is much less laborious but requires more expertise.

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera.

The themed flower parterre along Chang'an Avenue has also been in place to welcome the upcoming National Day.  The themed flowerbeds along Chang'an Avenue were created with over 200 flower varieties and depict themes including "all-around well-off society" and "hard-won battle against the epidemic," highlighting the historical achievements in the course of the country's development.  In Harbin City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, a symphony concert titled "Me and My Motherland" was held Wednesday.  The residents in Yuncheng City, north China's Shanxi Province, also expressed their love for the motherland through music by organizing a community variety show with various song and dance performances.    Reuniting with friends and loved ones is customary during the festive celebrations. In Gongliu County of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, neighbors and friends from near and far gathered to make and enjoy local delicacies like Dapanji, or big plate chicken stew, and moon cakes.  "We put pomegranate seeds on moon cakes, signifying that people of all ethnic groups remain closely united like the seeds of a pomegranate that stick together, and we all live a prosperous life," resident Guzinay told CGTN.  The attractions and featured streets in many places were lit up with dazzling lights, forming gorgeous night scenes.  At the Yellow River Tower in Lanzhou City, northwest China's Gansu Province, a 3D projection light show was held with dazzling lights illuminating the mother river and the night sky.  In Nanjing City, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, the nighttime economy injects vitality into Changjiang Road, a popular scenic spot with 1,800 years of history.  Tourists can visit the night market, taste delicious food and watch a show at the theater.    "I think it's good to bring my kid here to experience the culture and distinctive atmosphere of Nanjing," said resident Zhang Xiao.  In Hezhou City, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 2,300 drones changed formations in the night sky from time to time, forming patterns like the Chinese national flag and Tiananmen Rostrum, bringing viewers a visual feast.  In Shangqiu City, central China's Henan Province, a marvelous molten iron-splashing show awed spectators.  Listed as a national intangible cultural heritage item, the molten iron-splashing performance features one blacksmith throwing a ladle of molten iron up to the sky and another blacksmith beating the molten iron with a wooden club, creating a fascinating firework-like display to usher in the new year and extend wishes for good harvests. The activity can be traced back more than 1,000 years ago.In Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, the ancient city wall was lit in red, and the words "Celebrate National Day" and "I love you, motherland" were projected on its surface.

It provides help to unaccompanied asylum-seeking children in the area, such as English lessons and financial budgeting.She thinks the UK should be doing more to provide safe and legal routes for asylum and said "shutting the door in people's faces isn't going to make this issue go away."Chapman added: "In the grand scheme of displaced people in the world, it's a relatively small number and the UK really does need to do its bit. France takes four times as many asylum applications as we do. Germany takes 10 times as many."But not everyone thinks Britain should be as welcoming, particularly in the middle of a global COVID-19 pandemic that has curtailed travel for millions of people worldwide. On the streets of Dover, there appeared to be support for tougher immigration policies."They all come over here. They could be murderers, terrorists and no one's stopping them. They're pretending to be children and they're like 30 years old," said Leigh, a local resident."It's about time somebody put a stop to it, isn't it?" said Janet, another Dover resident. "I mean, we haven't got any schools, we've got no hospitals, we've got nothing. So how can we bring all these extra people in?" she added.Daniel, 32, said the arrivals had transformed the area: "The population has gone from a normal, British civilization to â¦ half of us aren't even British. Come on, we're not being funny, who's pure British these days?"The sentiments highlight the concern and anger felt by some parts of the UK's population about a perceived lack of control of its borders.The issue of immigration was a key part of the Brexit debate, which culminated in Britain's departure from the European Union. Soon, that will mean an end to the free movement of people to and from the EU. But for many migrants, their journey to the UK is often long and perilous."They come from places where there are problems: Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Sudan are common countries, also Syria, of course," said Chapman, back at the refugee center.Britain's government wants to make it easier to return potential asylum seekers who arrive from France and said smuggling gangs are profiting from the latest surge.Figures at the end of September suggest around 7,000 had made the journey, more than three times as many as in the whole of 2019.The latest increase in arrivals looks unlikely to stop any time soon. It's a journey that could mean life or death â but for the thousands attempting it, reaching the UK is worth risking the ultimate price.September has been the busiest month on record for migrants attempting to cross the English Channel.Around 2,000 people have been picked up by the UK's Border Force this month, many on small boats or dinghies, which are often unsafe.The UK recently beefed up patrols in the world's busiest shipping lane to dissuade people from embarking on the journey, often from France.The issue is being particularly felt in places such as Dover, a picturesque town in southern England where many migrants first arrive.  Bridget Chapman works with the nearby Kent Refugee Action Network.

However, it is hard to spot Victorine Obola's small photo studio, despite it being one of the busiest places inDunga. People from all over Kisumu county flock here to capture their memorable moments on the shores of the largest freshwater lake in Africa.Some are photographed while on the beach while others prefer to have their photos deep into the waters while boat riding. Weekends ushers in a beehive of activities for friends and families who want to experience the cool breeze here, eat fish, or just while away time.This is where Miss Obola plies her trade and this has turned her into the most sought-after photographer on the beach. This is manifested in the long ques of people lining up waiting for their photographs to be processed in her studio.She juggles between her interests in photography and the highly competitive but male-dominated profession of being a coxswain."What happened is that while doing door-to-door photography in the market, I saw a school bus by the roadside,â she says. "I went near it and talked to the driver and requested them if the teacher would want some photos to be taken because it seemed they had come for a tour. So they accepted. They told me they were looking for a photographer but they did not know where to get one. So I got onto the bus, we went to Kisumu Airport, then Kisumu Lakeport took them some photos, then they came to Dunga beach for boat riding,âShe was also fortunate to be admitted by the Dunga Beach Management, to practice her trade here. She however did not know that she would end up also doubling as a coxswain.Initially, she had been working in a photography studio owned that time by a member of parliament in Kisumu city."I had a passion for photography. I decided to go to my member of Parliament who employed me in his studio. I worked there for one year.â"After that I decided to buy a small camera, using my savings. It cost around Ksh.8000/$80.The first day I went to Kibuye, the jua kali sector, I talked to a few people. Luckily the first day I got Ksh.350/$3.I also took photos of my neighbors.âAfter getting a permit to work as a photographer at the beach, she also saw another opportunity. An opportunity to learn boat-riding skills and earn an extra coin."Since I had a passion in physics and there are some topics that we were taught in high-school concerning navigation, navigating a ship, I just had the interest and so I talked to some coxswains around to see if they could train me and they accepted.âBut what happens in case there are clients who need their moments at the beach captured on camera and those who need to be boat ridden in the Victorian waters?"There are so many male coxswains around, but in case I get a customer who wants boat riding, I talk to my fellow photographers to help me as I do the boat riding, âShe says.Her job requires an agile person and who is hawk-eyed to be able to spot clients streaming into the beach. But not just that, one needs to be patient and persuasive to convince them to be photographed and part with some cash rather than using their own phones to do it."The major obstacle is this era of digital. Personally, I trained using a manual camera, but people come with their phones. You just have to explain and tell them why you want them to use your camera," Obola submits.Additionally, she says, with regards to being a coxswain, there are customers who do not have confidence in a woman. But some only want to be taken to the lake by a lady, and if it's not her turn because they ride these boats in turns, they refuse to go with male coxswain.Obola however says she faces those challenges in stride knowing that her two jobs help her put food on the table as well as educate her siblings."I come from a family of nine. I am the 6th born and I am the breadwinner because I have been able to educate my three siblings in high school and university level using the same photography and boat riding work.âIt has been four years of photography and boat-riding at Lake Victoria. But for the 36-year-old Obola, expanding her territory is her biggest dream now.The Kenyan government has established a marine school at the Port of Kisumu and Miss Obola wants to take advantage of the institution to hone her boat-riding skills and become a certified coxswain soon."If the light of God illuminates my life one day one time, I get a speed boat, after having gotten the certificate to do my own, have my own boat because these ones are not mine.â"And as for my photography, my ambition is to have a big studio right in the town center with big digital machines plus the latest machines for lamination in bulk so that customers will be coming to do their photo-shoot and get what they want," she concludes.As we finish our interview with her, she smiles at the next clients who want to be photographed. She quickly bids us goodbye and tells me that life is to be lived and to be enjoyed but the biggest step is to not fear anything.When one visits Kisumu city lying on the western parts of Kenya at the shores of Lake Victoria, one cannot miss an opportunity to sample some of its beautiful beaches among them, Dunga beach that is just an 8 kilometers drive from the city center.The beach is alive thanks to various activities going on. However, it is hard to spot Victorine Obola's small photo studio, despite it being one of the busiest places inDunga. People from all over Kisumu county flock here to capture their memorable moments on the shores of the largest freshwater lake in Africa.Some are photographed while on the beach while others prefer to have their photos deep into the waters while boat riding. Weekends ushers in a beehive of activities for friends and families who want to experience the cool breeze here, eat fish, or just while away time.This is where Miss Obola plies her trade and this has turned her into the most sought-after photographer on the beach. This is manifested in the long ques of people lining up waiting for their photographs to be processed in her studio.She juggles between her interests in photography and the highly competitive but male-dominated profession of being a coxswain."What happened is that while doing door-to-door photography in the market, I saw a school bus by the roadside,â she says. "I went near it and talked to the driver and requested them if the teacher would want some photos to be taken because it seemed they had come for a tour. So they accepted. They told me they were looking for a photographer but they did not know where to get one. So I got onto the bus, we went to Kisumu Airport, then Kisumu Lakeport took them some photos, then they came to Dunga beach for boat riding,âShe was also fortunate to be admitted by the Dunga Beach Management, to practice her trade here. She however did not know that she would end up also doubling as a coxswain.Initially, she had been working in a photography studio owned that time by a member of parliament in Kisumu city."I had a passion for photography. I decided to go to my member of Parliament who employed me in his studio. I worked there for one year.â"After that I decided to buy a small camera, using my savings. It cost around Ksh.8000/$80.The first day I went to Kibuye, the jua kali sector, I talked to a few people. Luckily the first day I got Ksh.350/$3.I also took photos of my neighbors.âAfter getting a permit to work as a photographer at the beach, she also saw another opportunity. An opportunity to learn boat-riding skills and earn an extra coin."Since I had a passion in physics and there are some topics that we were taught in high-school concerning navigation, navigating a ship, I just had the interest and so I talked to some coxswains around to see if they could train me and they accepted.âBut what happens in case there are clients who need their moments at the beach captured on camera and those who need to be boat ridden in the Victorian waters?"There are so many male coxswains around, but in case I get a customer who wants boat riding, I talk to my fellow photographers to help me as I do the boat riding, âShe says.Her job requires an agile person and who is hawk-eyed to be able to spot clients streaming into the beach. But not just that, one needs to be patient and persuasive to convince them to be photographed and part with some cash rather than using their own phones to do it."The major obstacle is this era of digital. Personally, I trained using a manual camera, but people come with their phones. You just have to explain and tell them why you want them to use your camera," Obola submits.Additionally, she says, with regards to being a coxswain, there are customers who do not have confidence in a woman.

Besides buying mooncakes, the occasion is also marked in artistic ways.Making Chinese tea is quite a complicated and demanding job. The tea leaves, the tools and every procedure counts. At the Dajue Temple in Beijing, a demonstration showcases how to make green tea properly."Chinese tea culture has a history of thousands of years," said Murong Zigui, director of the Minghui Teahouse. "Every year, we celebrate the Mid-Autumn Day at the Dajue Temple. We hope that people would always remember this quiet and happy moment in their life, drinking tea and watching Guqin performance at this ancient site."Such events featuring traditional Chinese culture are frequently held at the temple for the past 20 years. Tasting tea and playing Guqin, a seven-string musical instrument, was a way for friends to spend time together in ancient China.Guqin artist Yang Qing believes that the two art forms share something in common. "The taste of Chinese tea is considered to be mild, restrained and it has a lingering aftertaste. And the sound of Guqin is considered heavy and rich, inspiring positive sentiments from the bottom of one's heart. Both art forms give people a feeling of jade-like warmness and smoothness, and are deeply favored by Chinese people," he said.In distant Luxembourg, a similar celebration featuring Chinese tea culture has also been held. The relaxing occasion, as its Chinese organizers say, is supposed to allow people to release some stress during the pandemic."We organized Wenshi Tea ceremonies for French friends to introduce them this traditional way of drinking tea that originated from the Tang Dynasty. I feel that French people are really interested in that," said Duan Xiaoyang, president of the Sino-European Association for Art and Intercultural Communication.Various celebrations are taking place across China and abroad to celebrate this year's traditional Mid-Autumn Festival.

The authorities suggest that tourists pay attention to their safety and check ticket reservations have been confirmed before traveling.Scenic attractions have increased capacity for visitorsBecause Mid-Autumn Festival coincides with the National Day holiday in 2020, this year's Golden Week holiday is one day longer than usual, and the eight-day holiday has made Chinese tourists even more eager to go out.China State Railway Group said on Monday that the National Day railway rush will start on September 28. From September 28 to October 8, China's railways are expected to carry 108 million passengers, an average of 9.82 million per day.October 1 will be the peak, with an estimated 13 million passengers on the rails, the highest daily passenger flow since the outbreak of the pandemic, the group said.In order to meet the needs of tourists, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism has lifted the upper limit for visitors at cultural and tourist locations from 50 percent to 75 percent of capacity.According to a notice released by the authority of Mount Huashan scenic area on September 28, the daily maximum passenger flow limit will be 20,000 and ticket sales will be stopped when the limit is reached.Meanwhile, starting from September 28, the maximum daily capacity for visitors to Mount Huangshan has been expanded from 25,000 to 37,500.From September 25, the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang City also raised the maximum daily limit of each ticket type to 75 percent of the normal capacity.Tickets to popular attractions are hard to getThe eight-day Golden Week has inspired people to travel. Some scenic attractions are already booked up, with popular spots such as the Palace Museum selling out from October 1 to 8.Tickets for the Jiuzhaigou Sparkling Lake in Sichuan Province from October 2 to 4 have also sold out.The ministry urged travelers to book tickets to scenic spots in advance.No booking, no travelShan Gangxin, deputy head of the Ministry of Culture and Tourism's resource development department, said that tourism sites should be opened and tickets booked in an orderly manner under the premise of overall prevention and control of the pandemic.The ministry also reminded tourists to understand and inquire in advance about epidemic prevention and control measures, opening hours, ticket reservations and passenger flow restrictions so as to ensure "no booking, no travel."For example, the Mount Huashan scenic area in northwest China's Shaanxi Province requires all tourists to register with the Shaanxi Health Code before booking tickets. Those with a green health code can book tickets, while those with a yellow or red code cannot.The Mount Huangshan scenic area in east China's Anhui Province also requires visitors to show a successful test or a matching ID card with health code and undertake a temperature test before entering the scenic area.Minimize 'unnecessary outbound travel'The Department of Consular Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reminded Chinese citizens to pay close attention to security alerts and overseas epidemic information issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and its embassies and consulates. It also urged travelers to fully assess the serious risks of cross-infection and the long quarantine period brought by international travel and minimize "unnecessary travel."(Cover image from CFP)With Mid-Autumn Festival and National Day approaching, some popular scenic attractions in China, such as the Palace Museum, are already booked up for the holiday, while other attractions are selling out fast.

Read our guide to the most widely used including the Antibody, PCR and Antigen tests â explaining exactly what they do, how much they cost and how accurate they are.When the immune system is exposed to COVID-19, it produces IgG antibodies to fight the virus. A COVID-19 antibody test looks for IgG antibodies in a blood sample â if present, that means you have had the illness. Studies have shown antibodies are produced approximately 14 days after the start of the illness, so the best time to take the test is 14 to 21 days after feeling unwell.What does a positive result mean?A positive result means you have been exposed to the virus and your immune system has produced antibodies in response. A small number of people may have had the virus and produced antibodies without ever feeling unwell, meaning they are asymptomatic carriers. What does a negative result mean?A true negative result means the immune system hasn't produced antibodies because you haven't been exposed to the virus. However, a false negative is when you have been exposed to the virus but antibodies haven't been identified, either because the test was taken too soon or the body simply hasn't produced antibodies to fight the virus.Is the test accurate?The Roche antibody test widely used in the UK is 100 percent accurate in identifying IgG antibodies and 99.8 percent accurate in determining that there are no antibodies in the bloodstream. However, the timings of the test (pictured above) mean false negatives can occur, so it's imperative the test is taken within the 14-to-21-day window for optimal accuracy.How much does it cost?In the UK, only certain people who work in social care in England and Wales are able to get an antibody test for free. Otherwise, they must be bought at private clinics, with prices starting at $84. In Germany, the same test costs $76.How long will it take to get my results?Results typically take up to 72 hours from private health services. The PCR test is used to detect whether the COVID-19 virus is currently present in your body. This is done by looking for evidence of the virus's genetic material, known as RNA, from a swab sample taken from the nose and back of the throat. In the lab, a reagent is added to the sample â if the RNA is present the reagent sparks a chain reaction so it is visible to scientists, who can then correctly identify a positive test. The test is also commonly referred to as an RNA, genetic, molecular, viral detection or swab test.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?PCR tests vary in accuracy. Some can be as low as 70 percent accurate, as outlined here by Oxford University Hospitals in the UK. However, FIND (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics), tested five COVID-19 RT-PCR tests and found that all five achieved 100 percent specitivity on positive samples, and at least 96 percent specificity on negative samples.How much does it cost?Most European countries have made PCR tests available for free, though foreign nationals entering many EU countries have to pay. Travelers landing at Germany's Munich airport are being charged $213 for a PCR test.How long will it take to get my results?Between 12 and 24 hours but new technology available in some hospitals and medical practices can return results within just four hours. Similar to PCR tests, antigen tests also attempt to find out if you currently have the virus, but the process is slightly different. Rather than looking for the virus's genetic material, an antigen test looks for the presence of proteins or glycans, such as the spike proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus, via a swab sample taken from the nose and mouth.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?Antigen tests are typically very fast and cheap in many countries but are not as accurate as PCR tests, with some experts claiming they could miss 15-20 percent of infections when only small amounts of proteins or glycans are present. How much does it cost?Private UK test centers charge up to $173, while in France, they are available in pharmacies for as little as $15.How long will it take to get my results?Antigen tests are the fastest of the COVID-19 tests, with some producing results in just a few minutes.A range of COVID-19 tests are being used across Europe. Read our guide to the most widely used including the Antibody, PCR and Antigen tests â explaining exactly what they do, how much they cost and how accurate they are.When the immune system is exposed to COVID-19, it produces IgG antibodies to fight the virus. A COVID-19 antibody test looks for IgG antibodies in a blood sample â if present, that means you have had the illness. Studies have shown antibodies are produced approximately 14 days after the start of the illness, so the best time to take the test is 14 to 21 days after feeling unwell.What does a positive result mean?A positive result means you have been exposed to the virus and your immune system has produced antibodies in response. A small number of people may have had the virus and produced antibodies without ever feeling unwell, meaning they are asymptomatic carriers. What does a negative result mean?A true negative result means the immune system hasn't produced antibodies because you haven't been exposed to the virus. However, a false negative is when you have been exposed to the virus but antibodies haven't been identified, either because the test was taken too soon or the body simply hasn't produced antibodies to fight the virus.Is the test accurate?The Roche antibody test widely used in the UK is 100 percent accurate in identifying IgG antibodies and 99.8 percent accurate in determining that there are no antibodies in the bloodstream. However, the timings of the test (pictured above) mean false negatives can occur, so it's imperative the test is taken within the 14-to-21-day window for optimal accuracy.How much does it cost?In the UK, only certain people who work in social care in England and Wales are able to get an antibody test for free. Otherwise, they must be bought at private clinics, with prices starting at $84. In Germany, the same test costs $76.How long will it take to get my results?Results typically take up to 72 hours from private health services. The PCR test is used to detect whether the COVID-19 virus is currently present in your body. This is done by looking for evidence of the virus's genetic material, known as RNA, from a swab sample taken from the nose and back of the throat. In the lab, a reagent is added to the sample â if the RNA is present the reagent sparks a chain reaction so it is visible to scientists, who can then correctly identify a positive test. The test is also commonly referred to as an RNA, genetic, molecular, viral detection or swab test.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading. The ideal time to take the test is eight days after being infected, which means there is enough genetic material to produce a positive result. If there isn't, you may receive a negative result despite being in the early stages of infection.Is the test accurate?PCR tests vary in accuracy. Some can be as low as 70 percent accurate, as outlined here by Oxford University Hospitals in the UK. However, FIND (Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics), tested five COVID-19 RT-PCR tests and found that all five achieved 100 percent specitivity on positive samples, and at least 96 percent specificity on negative samples.How much does it cost?Most European countries have made PCR tests available for free, though foreign nationals entering many EU countries have to pay. Travelers landing at Germany's Munich airport are being charged $213 for a PCR test.How long will it take to get my results?Between 12 and 24 hours but new technology available in some hospitals and medical practices can return results within just four hours. Similar to PCR tests, antigen tests also attempt to find out if you currently have the virus, but the process is slightly different. Rather than looking for the virus's genetic material, an antigen test looks for the presence of proteins or glycans, such as the spike proteins found on the surface of the coronavirus, via a swab sample taken from the nose and mouth.What does a positive result mean?The virus is currently present in your body, meaning you will have to self-isolate and take other necessary precautions advised by your national healthcare provider.What does a negative result mean?You don't have the virus or you have received a false negative reading.

Mgahinga is also home to the endangered mountain gorillas."Golden monkeys are special in that they have an outstanding color that is nearly to the gold color, they are unique in that you can only track them from the Virunga Massif,âJoyleen Tugume, a ranger-guide at Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) told Xinhua in a recent visit to the park. UWA is a state-owned conservation agency.High up the ridges of the volcanic Mount Muhabura, which is part of Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, the golden monkeys feed on largely bamboo shoots. They live in troops of about 100, led by an Alpha male, according to UWA.Uganda has one habituated troop of about 60 golden monkeys and another group of about 80 monkeys is also being habituated as the country builds new tourist attractions.Golden monkeys are endangered species. According to UWA, tourists who come to see the mountain gorillas, which are the country's main tourist attractions, can also track the golden monkeys.Before tracking the monkeys, at the park gate, standard operating procedures like hand sanitizing, face mask-wearing and social distancing are practiced in a bid to prevent the possible spread of COVID-19 to the monkeys.About 300 meters before reaching the golden monkeys, visitors are hand sanitized again and urged to keep their face masks on. Visitors are also not allowed to get less than 10 meters away from the animals.Tourism is one of Uganda's major foreign exchange earners, bringing in about 1.6 billion U.S. dollars annually, according to ministry of finance figures.Although the sector has been worst hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, government is optimistic that it will pick up as the country continues to ease the lockdown restrictions.Abiaz Rwamwiri, director at Africa Wild Explorations, a tour agency told Xinhua in a recent interview that once the country's international airport opens up on Oct. 1, as planned by government, tourists may start flocking in.Rwamwiri said that there are some confirmed tours scheduled for next year.Tucked on the common border with Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Uganda's Mgahinga Gorilla National Park is host to the endangered golden monkeys, a new tourist attraction.Mgahinga Gorilla National Park, which is part of the Virunga Massif is where "gold meets silver,âa tourism marketing catchphrase meaning a place where the golden monkeys coexist with the mountain gorilla silverbacks.

The football-obsessed SEC begins its season with fans in stadiums. Several teams in other leagues have had to postpone games because of outbreaks among players and staff.Institutions across the nation saw spikes of thousands of cases days after opening their doors in the last month, driven by students socializing with little or no social distancing. School and community leaders have tried to rein in the virus by closing bars, suspending students, adding mask requirements, and toggling between in-person and online instruction as case numbers rise and fall. Tension over the outbreaks is starting to boil over in college towns. Faculty members from at least two universities have held no-confidence votes in recent weeks against their top leaders, in part over reopening decisions. Government leaders want the University of Wisconsin-Madison to send its students home. Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, alarmed by what he sees as draconian rules on college campuses, said he is drawing up a "bill of rights" for college students. In Rhode Island, Gov. Gina Raimondo, a Democrat, this week blamed outbreaks at two colleges for a surge of virus cases that boosted the state's infection rate high enough to put it on the list of places whose residents are required to quarantine when traveling to New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. The University of Wisconsin-Madison had seen more than 2,800 confirmed cases in students as of Friday. The school shut down in-person instruction for two weeks, locked down two of its largest dorms, and imposed quarantines on more than a dozen sorority and fraternity houses. The school lifted the dorm lockdown just this week. Dane County Executive Joe Parisi has demanded the university send all its students home for the rest of the academic year. "(The virus) was under control until the university came back," Parisi said. Chancellor Rebecca Blank has fired back, saying tens of thousands of students with off-campus housing would still come to the city. She accused Parisi of failing to enforce capacity restrictions in bars and off-campus parties."You can't simply wish (students) away, nor should you," Blank said in a statement directed at Parisi. Amid the fighting, thousands of students around the country have been quarantined in dorm rooms. At Kansas State University, more than 2,200 students have been placed in quarantine or isolation since class began. Student Emily Howard was isolated in what students have dubbed "COVID jail" after she and her dorm roommate tested positive for the virus on September 4, just three weeks after arriving on campus. "Now you walk around campus (and) pretty much everyone says they've had it," Howard said. "Now we don't really care as much because we know we had the antibodies." Bryan Fisher, a UW-Madison freshman quarantined in the dorms, said students were allowed to leave only to get food from the dining hall, and they were given only 30 minutes to make each trip. He said he spent his time studying and watching movies. "We were pretty much stuck in here," Fisher said. "It's been pretty hard to meet new people. Everyone's expectations of college aren't what they were." The University of Connecticut on Friday placed a third dormitory under medical quarantine. More than 150 students have tested positive. The University of Missouri has had more than 1,500 confirmed cases among students since classes began. The school plans to limit the crowd at Saturday's home football opener against Alabama to no more than 11,700 fans, leaving the stands about 80 percent empty. Florida State on Friday decided to require that students test negative for the virus a week before a football game before being allowed to attend and must wear masks in the stands. Seminoles coach Mike Norvell tested positive for the virus last week. Despite the attempts at mitigation, student cases have sent local county infection numbers soaring. Schools' decisions to push on with the semester have frustrated some faculty and local community leaders. Faculty members at Appalachian State in August approved a no-confidence vote against Chancellor Sheri Everts over university finances, morale and reopening plans. Everts has said she has received support from the school's Board of Trustees. The University of Michigan faculty took a no-confidence vote against President Mark Schlissel earlier this month. Faculty felt Schlisselâs administration hasnât been transparent about reopening decisions and hasnât released any modeling gauging the health risks. Graduate students went on strike Sept. 8 to protest reopening. Schlissel has acknowledged that trust in his leadership had slipped, but the universityâs governing board expressed support him this week. "Colleges and universities are ... under immense pressure to remain open," said Chris Mariscano, director of the College Crisis Initiative, a research project at Davidson College tracking the effects of the virus on higher education. "When the president of the United States starts tweeting (about staying open), you understand just how much politics is playing a role here and institutional survival is playing a role here." University officials across the country say they hope to bolster testing and contact tracing as the semester continues. But Mariscano said universities should expect college students to act like college students. At Kansas State, Howard was not especially concerned about the virus and didn't mind the "COVID Jail," where students got free laundry service and their own bedrooms. "I personally am not too worried about it, and everyone I have talked to is not that worried about it," she said. "I think it is more like, you are going to get it. It's just a matter of when."(Cover image: Auburn students are scanned to check for a health screening questionnaire before entering the stadium for the start of an NCAA college football game between Auburn and Kentucky, September 26, 2020. /AP)Colleges across the U.S. are struggling to salvage the fall semester amid skyrocketing coronavirus cases, entire dorm complexes and frat houses under quarantine, and flaring tensions with local community leaders over the spread of the disease. Many major universities are determined to forge ahead despite warning signs, as evidenced by the expanding slate of college football games occurring Saturday.

Gatherings of 10 people or more will be banned between 11 p.m and 6 a.m, shops that sell food or drinks will have to close at 10 p.m and no food can be consumed at street markets. The Brussels region is experiencing one of the sharpest spikes in new infections in Belgium, averaging 323 new cases a day. BrusselsEuropean Health Commissioner Stella Kyriakides has become the latest top EU official to head into quarantine after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. In a tweet, she said she would be working from home and was experiencing no symptoms and felt well. Just last week, European Council President Charles Michel went into self-isolation after sharing a car ride with someone who later tested positive for the coronavirus. He exited quarantine on Friday after two negative COVID-19 tests. But the incident forced him to postpone a crucial leaders summit by a week.    Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamOn Monday night, the Dutch government will announce new measures to limit the spread of the virus in the densest regions of the country. Amsterdam (194 cases/100,000 inhabitants) and The Hague (180/100,000) are now in the Top 10 of cities with the most infections in Europe (Paris, with 231 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, tops the list). On Sunday, 2,999 people tested positive for COVID-19, a new daily record.The number of foreigners visiting the Netherlands is 70 percent lower than last year. Major events that were set in the Netherlands, Such as the Formula One Grand Prix, the Eurovision Song Contest and the UEFA Euro 2020 football tournament, were all canceled. Instead of the 21 million expected visitors, only seven million showed up. Also, 40 percent fewer Dutch people are going on holiday in their own country. This brings tourism in the Netherlands back to the level of the 1990s. Rahul Pathak in MadridIt's being reported that the socialist government of Pedro Sanchez could force the Madrid regional government to implement stricter coronavirus measures.  Right now 45 neighbourhoods in and around Madrid are under some form of lockdown, but the national government wants that extended to the entire city, which has the worst infection rate in Europe.  So far the right wing coalition government of Isabel Ayuso is resisting any further restrictions prompting the central government to say that it is prepared to intervene if there is "an urgent need." Isobel Ewing in BudapestPrime Minister Viktor Orban has assured Hungarians that the country will procure a vaccine against the coronavirus and it will be made available to everyone who needs it.Speaking on commercial broadcaster TV2, Orban said: "Brussels estimates the vaccine will be ready by 2021, while the Americans expect it to be ready by the end of the year".He added: "We'll be free from this misery and we will endure it until then."Orban said the coronavirus pandemic is worsening in Hungary and the situation is difficult, with a lot of pressure on health and education both now and in the coming months. However, he believes that as the winter months approach, people will be more inclined to abide by hygiene rules.Andrew Wilson in LondonThe government is expected to enforce a total social lockdown on large parts of the country today, including London. Pubs and restaurants could be ordered to close for two weeks and households banned from meeting each other.As of today, people face a heavy fine if they do not self-isolate after a positive test or are told to quarantine by test-and-trace services. Household members should also self-isolate by law.The police are expected to start carrying out spot checks in areas where there are high levels of the virus.Thousands of university students remain in self-isolation in their halls of residence. Ministers say any complaints about fees should be directed at the institutions, not the government. Ross Cullen in ParisIn France, the latest measures came into force overnight on Sunday into Monday, including the closure of all bars and restaurants in Marseille, Aix-en-Provence and Guadeloupe. In Paris, sports centers and gyms have closed and bars in the capital now must close at 10 p.m. These measures will be in place for at least two weeks. The moves come as a new poll in the Journal de Dimanche Sunday newspaper shows that 72 percent of French citizens are in favor of new nationwide lockdown for at least 15 days. In the same survey, it showed that only 44 percent of those polled said they trusted the government to help businesses recover. On Monday, finance minister Bruno Le Maire will present the budget for next year. The 2021 finance bill sets out the main lines of the $116 billion stimulus plan and the government says its forecasts have anticipated a possible deterioration in economic health. FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: WHO backs China's emergency use of COVID-19 vaccinesCGTN America: Is New York dead?

In a tweet, she said she would be working from home and was experiencing no symptoms and felt well. Just last week, European Council President Charles Michel went into self-isolation after sharing a car ride with someone who later tested positive for the coronavirus. He exited quarantine on Friday after two negative COVID-19 tests. But the incident forced him to postpone a crucial leaders summit by a week.    Stefan de Vries in AmsterdamOn Monday night, the Dutch government will announce new measures to limit the spread of the virus in the densest regions of the country. Amsterdam (194 cases/100,000 inhabitants) and The Hague (180/100,000) are now in the Top 10 of cities with the most infections in Europe (Paris, with 231 infections per 100,000 inhabitants, tops the list). On Sunday, 2,999 people tested positive for COVID-19, a new daily record.The number of foreigners visiting the Netherlands is 70 percent lower than last year. Major events that were set in the Netherlands, Such as the Formula One Grand Prix, the Eurovision Song Contest and the UEFA Euro 2020 football tournament, were all canceled. Instead of the 21 million expected visitors, only seven million showed up. Also, 40 percent fewer Dutch people are going on holiday in their own country. This brings tourism in the Netherlands back to the level of the 1990s. Rahul Pathak in MadridIt's being reported that the socialist government of Pedro Sanchez could force the Madrid regional government to implement stricter coronavirus measures.  Right now 45 neighbourhoods in and around Madrid are under some form of lockdown, but the national government wants that extended to the entire city, which has the worst infection rate in Europe.  So far the right wing coalition government of Isabel Ayuso is resisting any further restrictions prompting the central government to say that it is prepared to intervene if there is "an urgent need." Isobel Ewing in BudapestPrime Minister Viktor Orban has assured Hungarians that the country will procure a vaccine against the coronavirus and it will be made available to everyone who needs it.Speaking on commercial broadcaster TV2, Orban said: "Brussels estimates the vaccine will be ready by 2021, while the Americans expect it to be ready by the end of the year".He added: "We'll be free from this misery and we will endure it until then."Orban said the coronavirus pandemic is worsening in Hungary and the situation is difficult, with a lot of pressure on health and education both now and in the coming months. However, he believes that as the winter months approach, people will be more inclined to abide by hygiene rules.Andrew Wilson in LondonThe government is expected to enforce a total social lockdown on large parts of the country today, including London. Pubs and restaurants could be ordered to close for two weeks and households banned from meeting each other.As of today, people face a heavy fine if they do not self-isolate after a positive test or are told to quarantine by test-and-trace services. Household members should also self-isolate by law.The police are expected to start carrying out spot checks in areas where there are high levels of the virus.Thousands of university students remain in self-isolation in their halls of residence. Ministers say any complaints about fees should be directed at the institutions, not the government. Ross Cullen in ParisIn France, the latest measures came into force overnight on Sunday into Monday, including the closure of all bars and restaurants in Marseille, Aix-en-Provence and Guadeloupe. In Paris, sports centers and gyms have closed and bars in the capital now must close at 10 p.m. These measures will be in place for at least two weeks. The moves come as a new poll in the Journal de Dimanche Sunday newspaper shows that 72 percent of French citizens are in favor of new nationwide lockdown for at least 15 days. In the same survey, it showed that only 44 percent of those polled said they trusted the government to help businesses recover. On Monday, finance minister Bruno Le Maire will present the budget for next year. The 2021 finance bill sets out the main lines of the $116 billion stimulus plan and the government says its forecasts have anticipated a possible deterioration in economic health. FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: WHO backs China's emergency use of COVID-19 vaccinesCGTN America: Is New York dead?

Many online platforms are believed to be using this information to manipulate the prices we pay for the products and services we frequently use so that we end up paying more than others. The Chinese government has said such activities must stop. With China's National Day Golden Week starting on October 1, the directive could not be more timely. The pandemic is largely under control across the country, and millions of people will be capitalizing on the easing measures to get away for a few days.Online bookings are the preferred choice, but it seems the more you use certain platforms, the more susceptible you are to higher prices. "Some platforms have a huge mass of people's personal information, and use artificial intelligence algorithms to personalize prices for these people. Then price discrimination may occur," said Zhi Zhenfeng, a research fellow at the Institute of Law at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "It is likely a violation of consumer rights laws," Zhi said. "Although there are many laws protecting personal information, there is no specific law in this regard. This gives some fraudulent sellers the opportunity to personalize prices." The government has identified this problem and has issued temporary regulations. They stipulate that online travel agencies should obtain the consent of users before collecting their personal information.Users should know what's being recorded, why it's being recorded and how it will be used. Meanwhile, online travel agencies are told not to use people's information to personalize or bump-up prices."The new regulation could protect consumers' rights and interests by defining the responsibilities of the online travel agencies," said Zhi. "It will improve the environment of consumers to a certain extent." However, the problem isn't exclusive to travel. It also happens when customers purchase goods online or even order food. Once these platforms understand your preferences through big data, they can manipulate the price you have to pay.So what can consumers do to avoid paying more?"When consumers register on these online platforms, they should pay close attention to the information they're being asked for," Zhi said. "They should make sure what kind of authorization the platform would get. If the platform requires excessive information, for example, a lot of personal information, then consumers should file a complaint if they can't refuse."Zhi also warned about the information that gets collected when companies give away gifts and discounts. "It's better to refrain from small gains online, such as swiping a QR code or clicking an electronic gift," Zhi said.

As the eight-day National Day holiday fast approaches, the annual ecological tourism festival featuring Populus euphratica is scheduled to open in Ejin during the Golden Week.Populus euphratica, also known as desert poplar, is a rare species that can survive in extremely dry and cold regions, commonly found in temperate deserts in China's western part. Sitting in the Gobi Desert, Ejin is home to one of the largest Populus euphratica forests in the country â nearly 30,000 hectares.Over the years, by putting the rich resources of poplar desert forests into good use, Ejin has made various efforts in developing the tourism industry while preserving the rare species. The thriving tourism businesses have boosted the local economy and helped those once impoverished households escape extreme poverty.Ejin has built several tourist attractions, among which the Populus Euphratica Forest Tourist Area has now become one of the must-visit spots in autumn for outings and photographs and also a landmark in Ejin.The booming tourism sector has then tempted more local farmers and herdsmen to join the cooperative to run various tourism-related businesses, such as opening homestay inns, offering horse-riding, camel-riding, as well as off-riding vehicle rental services at the scenic spot.As of the end of 2019, 63 registered poor households (146 people) in Ejin were able to witness a surge in their earnings through working in the tourism industry. Statistics from the local government showed that their average annual income saw an increase of 13,637 yuan (2,000 U.S. dollars) per household compared with the previous year.Acknowledging the significant role that the ecological environment has played in Ejin's tourism development, local people started to make efforts in ecological construction and preservation. In 2018, China Green Foundation, a non-governmental organization, launched a "Euphrates poplar project" in Inner Mongolia in a bid to fight desertification. Also, in this June, the local government launched a set of regulations on protecting the desert poplar forests in Ejin.Read more: Inner Mongolia's rejuvenating desert poplar forestsLast year from January to November, Ejin received a total of 8 million domestic and foreign tourists, a year-on-year increase of 15 percent, with the overall tourism revenue exceeding 7.6 billion yuan (1.1 billion U.S. dollars), according to Du Zigang, deputy director of the local culture and tourism bureau.

Holding carnival - whether it's samba schools or 'blocos,' any kind of carnival with crowds of people - without certainty on a vaccine or guarantees for people's health is a mistake," said Rita Fernandes, president of the Sebastiana association."Sebastiana has decided that without a vaccine and especially without health guarantees for the population, we're not going to hold any kind of carnival at all," she told TV network Globo News.Rio's carnival, the world's biggest, draws millions of tourists from around Brazil and the world each year.But it has become the latest casualty of the pandemic, as Brazil struggles to get a handle on the second-deadliest outbreak of COVID-19 in the world, after the United States.Brazil has registered 4.7 million infections and nearly 140,000 deaths from the virus.And while its spread has slowed somewhat since July, the numbers are still alarmingly high, with an average of nearly 30,000 new cases and 735 new deaths per day over the past two weeks, according to health ministry figures.Rio is the Brazilian city hit second-hardest, after economic capital Sao Paulo, with 10,730 deaths.This is the first time it has postponed carnival since 1912.The pandemic had already forced Rio to scrap another tourist magnet, its annual New Year's Eve celebrations on Copacabana beach.The city's economy will likely take a hit from both decisions. Last year, carnival brought 1.5 million tourists to Rio and added 3.8 billion reais (685 million U.S. dollars) to the economy.But many residents said they supported the move."I'm a huge fan of carnival - I go to the 'blocos,' I dance in a samba school. But right now we need to be protecting people, especially the elderly," Carla Mauro, a 52-year-old architect, said on Copacabana."A year with no carnival won't kill anyone."(Cover: Queen of Percussion Raissa Machado of Unidos do Viradouro Samba School performs during the 2020 Rio de Janeiro Carnival champions' parade at the Sapucai Sambadrome on February 29, 2020 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. /CFP)Revelers hoping to escape the coronavirus doldrums at Rio de Janeiro's world-famous carnival got more bad news Friday as organizers indefinitely postponed the city's epic street parties, a day after the official parades were scrapped.Originally scheduled for February 2021, the Brazilian beach city's carnival is a massive mixture of social-distancing no-no's, from the huge crowds that attend the annual samba school parade competition to the giant free-for-all of street parties known as "blocos."After organizers announced Thursday they were indefinitely postponing the samba school parades because of the pandemic, the association responsible for 11 of the biggest "blocos" said it was following suit."The samba school league made the absolutely correct decision.

It drew travelers and traders from far and wide, all with different perspectives on life and eager to learn from others. It was known to be a place where a belief system could truly thrive.  The centuries seem to have passed by in a flash here. Yet, the long passage of time could not totally bury history.  There are ruins of Subash Temple north of the city of Kuqa in southern Xinjiang, highlighting the dominance of the Buddhist religion in these parts."Buddhism came to Qiuci around the 2nd century," illustrated Miao Lihui, chief researcher at Kucha Academy of Xinjiang. "Construction began on Subash in the following century. It was supposed to be the largest temple here. It flourished until the 12th century." "From here, we can see traces of the time when Indian Buddhism was introduced into China, and Chinese Buddhism later spread westward," Miao said. These traces have gone down in history and the evidence is still quite vague.  However, there are stronger claims in the Kizil Buddhist cave temples in neighboring Baicheng County. Miao Lihui has been doing research here for two decades. "The theme of these paintings is closely related to Sakyamuni, and so are the stories. The tales are about Buddha's previous lives and journey in this life. On this dome, there's a painting of the Buddha's life as Prince Sudana is sacrificing his own life to save a family of tigers," Miao explained as he showed us into a cave. These paintings are said to encourage kindness and good deeds. It was actually from Qiuci where Buddhism was introduced to central China.  Qiuci's prince Kumarajiva traveled eastward and translated numerous Buddhist scriptures into the ancient Chinese language in Chang'an, today's Xi'an City, northwest China's Shaanxi Province, until he passed away.  "We see these temples, grottoes and the Buddhists who once lived here and brought Buddhism to Qiuci. Through this, they were able to bridge cultural exchanges between the east and the west and promote world cultural prosperity and development," Miao said. Though in the past centuries, many were stolen and brought to other parts of the world, those that remain are well-preserved and listed as part of a UNESCO World Heritage site. They are our window into a time when Buddhism truly flourished in Xinjiang. Over time, Buddhism gradually disappeared from Qiuci, now known as Kuqa. But its legacy remains. It will not quietly turn to ashes and dust, but rather be remembered for generations to come.  Kuqa, a bustling township at the center of the ancient state of Qiuci, used to be a hub for business, culture and thoughts along the ancient Silk Road.

Designers from across the nation have brought their latest ideas to inspire Beijing visitors. Modern design ideas refresh various articles for everyday use, like furniture, costumes, and decorations. How to transmit the country's rich cultural heritage has been a subject much discussed among artists and craftsmen in recent years. Many believe merging ancient with modern in fashion for mass production is the best way. "The Chinese tiger pillow is a mascot inherited from ancient China. It has been considered a symbol of protection of its owner and was commonly used as pillows or sachets. Artist Sanmao uses it in jewelry making.

Designing small garden-like spaces is their new business direction, and turns out to be very popular."We hope that every individual can get access to plants in their living space, including home and office.

Mass gatherings have also been limited - down from a maximum number of attendees of 5,000 to 1,000 people. Also coming into force on Tuesday are the new infection and isolation measures for schools, which will see classes only all being sent home if there are three positive cases in one class (from three different households). And Italy is tightening its rules for travellers coming in from France by making arrivals from seven regions, including Paris, undergo compulsory COVID-19 tests. Nawied Jabarkhyl in LondonPrime Minister Boris Johnson is set to address the nation on Tuesday evening after a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks.

Almost half of them fear consequences by their employer if they call in sick.  Mia Alberti in FrankfurtGerman Health Minister Jens Spahn is visiting the Frankfurt plant of the biopharmaceutical giant, Sanofi, one of the laboratories leading the race for a COVID-19 vaccine.Sanofi is set to be the main supplier of the vaccine when it is completed. The EU has signed an agreement with the French company for the supply of 300 million doses.In Germany, the government has been heavily supportive of vaccine development and research. On 15 September, it announced $881 million in funding for the three German companies working on possible vaccines: Biontech, Curevac and IDT Biologika.Minister Jens Spahn has warned "there won't be enough vaccine for everyoneâ¦ at the beginning," but "there will certainly be enough for everyone within months," he told public broadcast Deutschlandfunk on Monday.Toni Waterman in BrusselsThe Belgian government plans to ease up on travel bans in a bid to foster better coordination between EU member states. Come Friday, it will replace bans on travel to "red zones" with notices strictly advising against travel to these areas. Belgium has been the only European country to ban travel to red zones, allowing few exemptions to the rule and requiring a COVID-19 test and 14-days of quarantine upon return. The change comes as the number of cases in the country surges, averaging nearly 1,200 new infections a day. The government said teenagers make up the bulk of new cases. And with the reproduction rate at 1.3, the epidemic is still growing.  Ross Cullen in ParisThe city of Lyon has introduced stricter measures to try to control the surge in new coronavirus cases. The number of communities in the wider RhÃ´ne region where face masks are obligatory has been extended. There are new limits on care home visits: each resident can have only two visits a week. Mass gatherings have also been limited - down from a maximum number of attendees of 5,000 to 1,000 people. Also coming into force on Tuesday are the new infection and isolation measures for schools, which will see classes only all being sent home if there are three positive cases in one class (from three different households). And Italy is tightening its rules for travellers coming in from France by making arrivals from seven regions, including Paris, undergo compulsory COVID-19 tests. Nawied Jabarkhyl in LondonPrime Minister Boris Johnson is set to address the nation on Tuesday evening after a sharp rise in COVID-19 cases in recent weeks. The UK has raised its coronavirus threat level from 3 to 4, meaning transmission is "high or rising exponentially". On Monday, more than 4,350 cases were recorded in the country.Across England from Thursday, all pubs, bars, restaurants and cafes will have to shut their doors at 10pm.Johnson, speaking to Parliament on Tuesday, also urged people to work from home again if they can, a U-turn on the government's previous advice. Plans for spectators to return to elite sporting events from 1 October has been postponed whilst people attending weddings will now be limited to 15 people, down from 30 previously. "We should assume unless there is progress, that the restrictions go on for six months," said Johnson. Isobel Ewing in BudapestAs schools return amid a rising infection rate in Hungary, Minister of Human Capacities MiklÃ³s KÃ¡sler has said teachers who catch coronavirus at work are entitled to full sick pay.However the Teachers' Trade Union says that in practice, whether this happens depends on the goodwill of schools.According to the union president TamÃ¡s Totyik, in the absence of fixed regulations, some schools treat the infection as an occupational disease, so teachers receive 100 percent of their basic salary, but other schools don't recognise it as such.Another teachers' advocacy group, the Teachers' Democratic Union (PDSZ), has called for testing to be provided to teachers by their employers, saying it's currently impossible to determine whether teachers have been infected while at work.Six hundred and thirty three new cases were registered in Hungary on Tuesday, and eight people died.FROM OUR GLOBAL COLLEAGUESCGTN Europe special: Redesigning the FutureCGTN China: Experts: How China was able to eliminate COVID-19 so quicklyCGTN America: Post COVID-19 care center emerges in New YorkCGTN Africa: South African schools complying with health protocol: SurveySign up here to get the COVID-19 Europe bulletin sent directly to your inboxCGTN Europe has been providing in-depth coverage of the novel coronavirus story as it has unfolded. Here you can read the essential information about the crisis.Urban construction and architectural development have always been an important part of the annual Beijing International Design Week.

Due to the impact of COVID-19, tourists tend to choose shorter trips in order to spend less time travelling. The recommended routes are meant to tap into local cultural and agricultural resources and boost economic growth. Data by the ministry showed that rural tourism in the country experienced a strong recovery in the second quarter of this year, with the total revenue increasing by nearly 149 percent from 69.5 billion yuan (about 10.3 billion U.S. dollars) in the first quarter, and continued to pick up steam. China celebrates its National Day on October 1 every year. This year the Mid-Autumn Festival falls on the same day, overlapping with the National Day holiday that extends to October 8, totaling eight days.(Cover: Gusu District in Suzhou City, east China's Jiangsu Province. /VCG)China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism has recommended 300 quality rural tourism routes ahead of the upcoming National Day holiday. The routes cover all provincial-level regions in the country, featuring road trips, sightseeing and homestays. According to the ministry, rural tourism has been gaining popularity among holidaymakers as they place more emphasis on safety, health and the feeling of coziness during travel.

This number, he said, was 2.6 times higher than the one before the COVID-19 outbreak. These flights have been strengthening the bonds amid the pandemic, he added.The first direct international flight to land in Beijing following the lifting of COVID-19 curbs was that of Air China (CA746). Departing from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, the plane landed at the Beijing Capital International Airport on September 3, signifying the resumption of direct international flights.Resumption of flights in China offers a glimmer of hope for the aviation industry globally. However, travel norms for passengers, especially when it comes to air travel, have changed in ways that were previously unimaginable.New guidelines for air travel As the restrictions are eased, an increasing number of people are choosing air travel to commute domestically. Naturally, airports are not how they used to be.Passengers need to wear masks covering their nose and mouth, and there are signs reminding them to do so everywhere at the airports. Additionally, it is essential to practice social distancing, staying at least 6 feet apart, especially when waiting in line."Most viruses and germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes," according to travel guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Some airline companies have canceled their in-flight meals to decrease touch points onboard, while others are providing passengers with pre-packaged meals only. For example, Delta announced that "customers in all cabins will now receive their own personal snack bags on domestic flights," which include crackers and cookies. Body temperature checks are becoming part of the new airline boarding process, as a fever above 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit is one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19, according to CDC and other medical institutions.  A health QR code or health declaration form has become a travel necessity in China after the coronavirus outbreak. Filling in the health code information before landing could save one more time. It's important to check the policies of the destination cities or countries for information, as some regions will require a nucleic acid test for COVID-19 before entry. The number of passengers globally will not return to pre-pandemic levels until 2024, according to International Air Transport Association. So, passengers now are adjusting to new guidelines for air travel. (Cover image designed by Feng Yuan)In the end of August, China was operating more than 13,000 flights per day, hitting about 90 percent of the pre-pandemic level, said Cui Xiaofeng, deputy director of Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), on September 9. Speaking at the 2020 China International Fair for Trade in Services (CIFTIS), Cui said as many as 1,068 cargo flights operated between China and the countries and regions along the Belt and Road on a weekly basis. This number, he said, was 2.6 times higher than the one before the COVID-19 outbreak. These flights have been strengthening the bonds amid the pandemic, he added.The first direct international flight to land in Beijing following the lifting of COVID-19 curbs was that of Air China (CA746). Departing from Phnom Penh in Cambodia, the plane landed at the Beijing Capital International Airport on September 3, signifying the resumption of direct international flights.Resumption of flights in China offers a glimmer of hope for the aviation industry globally. However, travel norms for passengers, especially when it comes to air travel, have changed in ways that were previously unimaginable.New guidelines for air travel As the restrictions are eased, an increasing number of people are choosing air travel to commute domestically. Naturally, airports are not how they used to be.Passengers need to wear masks covering their nose and mouth, and there are signs reminding them to do so everywhere at the airports. Additionally, it is essential to practice social distancing, staying at least 6 feet apart, especially when waiting in line."Most viruses and germs do not spread easily on flights because of how air circulates and is filtered on airplanes," according to travel guidelines issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Some airline companies have canceled their in-flight meals to decrease touch points onboard, while others are providing passengers with pre-packaged meals only.

A member of the university staff was also on the flight to answer questions from students.Zhang Meifang, China's consul general in Belfast and Ian Greer, president and vice-chancellor of Queen's University Belfast, were at Belfast International Airport to welcome the arriving students."Affected by the global pandemic, studying abroad in this year is different from previous years," Zhang said in a welcome speech, adding that the Chinese government attaches great importance to the QUB's charter flight plan."The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Education, The Civil Aviation Administration of China and other departments have worked closely with our consulate, to actively practice 'diplomacy for the people', to ensure everyone's safety and make their study overseas journey smooth," she said, and also thanked Queen's University for taking the unusual step to show its commitment to students from China.According to Zhang, the charter flight is also the first direct commercial flight from China to Northern Ireland, which marks a milestone in the cultural exchanges between the two sides.Greer said in his welcome message to the Chinese students that he is delighted they have made the journey safely, adding that the university has put in place a comprehensive range of measures, in line with public health guidelines, to ensure the campus is a safe place to live, work, and study."Your teaching will be delivered by a connected learning approach. You will be taught face-to-face with the relevant social distancing and hygiene measures applied at all times, complemented by online classes when necessary," he told the students.There are currently more than 1,000 Chinese students studying at Queen's University Belfast.Alderman Frank McCoubrey, Lord Mayor of Belfast, said in a video to the overseas students that "We understand what a huge decision this must have been to leave your homes and country in the current climate. We are delighted by your choice and can ensure you of a friendly welcome and an unforgettable time here in the city."With international travel badly impacted by the pandemic, a number of British universities are chartering flights from China, India and Africa to encourage international students to return in this academic year.A recent survey conducted by QS, the higher education think tank which compiles the World University Rankings, showed that only one in seven overseas students due to study in Britain this year still plans to come.According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the number of students from China studying in UK higher education surpassed 120,000 last year for the first time, accounting for more than one in every three non-EU students. And the total number of Chinese students studying in the UK is now more than 220,000, Chinese government figures show.(Cover: A dedicated direct flight taking 369 students from China landed in Northern Ireland's Belfast, UK, September 19, 2020. /Photo via China Daily)A dedicated direct flight taking 369 students from China landed in Northern Ireland's Belfast on Saturday, allowing them to arrive ahead of the start of the academic year amid travel disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.Chartered by the Queen's University Belfast (QUB), one of the first universities in Britain, the one-way flight brought new and returning students from China to campus, to reduce anxiety and stress about traveling for the new semester.The direct flight took off from Beijing Friday to Belfast and has brought back more than one in four Chinese students registered at the university.All students were required to take a COVID-19 test 48 hours prior to departure and need to provide a negative result in order to board the plane.The university also organized airport pick-up, transport to their campus on a fleet of dedicated coaches, and quarantine support.

Since the initial launch of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway in 2006, this railway has become the most popular and convenient way to connect Tibet to the rest of China, bringing tremendous profits to the regions.Dubbed the "sky road" and noted as a man-made wonder in transportation, the 1,956-kilometer-long world-renowned railway begins in Xining and ends in Lhasa. The stunning scenery along the railway offers not only a feast for the eyes, but also a journey for the soul. Come join CGTN to enjoy the enchanting trip on the Qinghai-Tibet train! Qinghai Lake: A paradise for birdwatchers and cyclistsStarting from Xining Railway Station, it takes around one hour to appreciate the stunning view of Qinghai Lake. Dazzling like a crystal-clear gem, Qinghai Lake is the largest inland lake as well as saline lake in China. Surrounded by lofty mountains, the lake features two sub-lakes: a saline Gahai Lake and a freshwater Erhai Lake. Be it the blue sky and water, the green grassland or mesmerizing landscapes â Qinghai Lake boasts great charms worth exploring.Qinghai Lake is definitely a paradise for bird lovers as many different kinds of birds would fly here to breed in May and June due to the mild weather. Meanwhile, for cyclists, cycling around the lake not only allows them to enjoy the beauty of the lake view, but also while away the time.Tips: The best time to visit the Qinghai Lake is from April to August as numerous Cole flowers blossom along the lake during that time, forming breathtaking scenery for visitors. In addition, May and June are the best season for bird watching.Kunlun Mountains: More than just mountainsAs the train keeps moving up, a picturesque view of the Kunlun Mountains appears before you. Reputed as the holy mountains, the Kunlun extend west from the Pamirs with a length of 2,500 kilometers. The 6,178-meter-high Yuzhu Peak is the highest of the Kunlun Mountains in Qinghai. The high peaks are covered with snow and mist all year round, creating a stunning view along the Qinghai-Tibet Railway. It's worth mentioning that Yuzhu Peak is the first sightseeing station for passengers, which allows them to get off the train and take photos outside. It is considered to be an ideal choice for hiking beginners as its route requires less technique.Hoh Xil Nature Reserve: 'Forbidden zone for humans'Hoh Xil, which means "green mountains" in Mongolian, is a plateau between the Kunlun and Tanggula mountain ranges, with an average altitude of 5,000 meters. Home to many wild animals, including the Tibetan antelope and the wild yak, Hoh Xil Nature Reserve is undoubtedly a desolate region in the northwestern part of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in China. The extensive area of alpine mountains and steppe systems is situated more than 4,500 meters above sea level, where sub-zero average temperatures prevail all year round. The geographic and harsh climatic conditions have made this place a "forbidden zone for humans," which is also a reason for its biodiversity. This is probably one of the few places left on Earth where one could get off the beaten track and find inner peace.  Tips:  As there are no signs in Hoh Xil Nature Reserve, visitors often get lost here. Remember to bring a local guide with you or rent a car to travel. Tsonag Lake: A 'soul lake' for TibetansLying in Amdo County, Nagqu Prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region, Tsonag Lake is one of the most significant holy lakes to local residents.  The Qinghai-Tibet railway passes right by the lake, making it the closest altiplano lake to the railway on the road. Passengers can take photos and capture the charming view of the lake as they would definitely have something to brag about on social media.Lhasa: The start of the journey to TibetThe final destination of the Qinghai-Tibet train trip â Lhasa, offers almost every aspect of Tibetan culture. If one must pick a name card for Lhasa, the Potala Palace is very likely to be the answer. No one can really say that he/she has visited Lhasa unless they have been to the Potala Palace â a must-see for travelers from home and abroad. Tibet is always full of incredible scenery. In early March when most of the plateau is still tinged with a wintry chill, Nyingchi Prefecture, in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, is blanketed with pink blossoms. If you want to record all the scenery along the sky road, seeing them yourself is not enough. The feelings from the bottom of your heart are important. So, what are you still waiting for? It's time to pack your bag and start the soul journey to Tibet where you could completely hand over yourself to nature and experience the unique Tibetan culture.  For centuries, Tibet has not been explored as much by the outside world due to its remote location, extreme climate and geographic environment.

At a themed forum on Thursday, big names from the country's streaming services gathered to discuss how to produce documentaries that appeal to Generation Z.   When it comes to documentaries, many people think of educational films or series that are too dry to keep viewers' attention.  However for streaming services like Bilibili, Youku and iQiyi, documentaries are the best way to win over viewers, especially the younger ones, if you know what really speaks to them.  As part of the themed forum at this year's Beijing Documentary Week, representatives from these companies have come to share their stories at the China Millennium Monument Museum.  Bilibili, which started as ACG video platform, has a track record of success with younger generations like Gen Z in distributing documentaries in recent years.  Previous hit series on the platform include "The Story of CHUAN'ER" the popular grilled kebabs, which has been viewed over 200 million times through the first two seasons.  Zhu Xiangliang, senior adviser at the Documentary Department of Bilibili, told CGTN, "The documentaries distributed via new media platforms offer more interaction between the audience and the production team than ever before. For example, some viewers would make stickers or render clips of our documentaries in new ways, and these would bring more attention to the series. It's a positive succession."Zhu revealed that young viewers are equally attracted to themes like history and traditional crafts, contrary to conventional thinking.  A good example is Bilibili's two-season documentary which has taken a different angle on historic figures, like bringing the gourmet side of poet Su Shi. And technology also helps to bring a fresh perspective and a modern approach to documentaries. Zhang Wei, director of Youku Documentary Center, explained, "Creative storytelling methods like what we did with The Legend Hunters can give documentaries a new look to hook the younger generation. Mini mobile games are mixed into The Legend Hunters as a way to explain archaeological methodology and the science relevant to this site. In the near future we might see more interactive documentaries or even ones specifically designed for vertical screens." Beijing Documentary Week will also see the release of quality documentaries and themed screenings.  It runs till Tuesday, September 22. The fourth edition of Beijing Documentary Week which kicked off Tuesday is in full swing, bringing 54 selected documentaries and a series of exhibitions, seminars and cultural events to the capital. At a themed forum on Thursday, big names from the country's streaming services gathered to discuss how to produce documentaries that appeal to Generation Z.   When it comes to documentaries, many people think of educational films or series that are too dry to keep viewers' attention.  However for streaming services like Bilibili, Youku and iQiyi, documentaries are the best way to win over viewers, especially the younger ones, if you know what really speaks to them.  As part of the themed forum at this year's Beijing Documentary Week, representatives from these companies have come to share their stories at the China Millennium Monument Museum.  Bilibili, which started as ACG video platform, has a track record of success with younger generations like Gen Z in distributing documentaries in recent years.  Previous hit series on the platform include "The Story of CHUAN'ER" the popular grilled kebabs, which has been viewed over 200 million times through the first two seasons.  Zhu Xiangliang, senior adviser at the Documentary Department of Bilibili, told CGTN, "The documentaries distributed via new media platforms offer more interaction between the audience and the production team than ever before. For example, some viewers would make stickers or render clips of our documentaries in new ways, and these would bring more attention to the series. It's a positive succession."Zhu revealed that young viewers are equally attracted to themes like history and traditional crafts, contrary to conventional thinking.  A good example is Bilibili's two-season documentary which has taken a different angle on historic figures, like bringing the gourmet side of poet Su Shi. And technology also helps to bring a fresh perspective and a modern approach to documentaries. Zhang Wei, director of Youku Documentary Center, explained, "Creative storytelling methods like what we did with The Legend Hunters can give documentaries a new look to hook the younger generation. Mini mobile games are mixed into The Legend Hunters as a way to explain archaeological methodology and the science relevant to this site. In the near future we might see more interactive documentaries or even ones specifically designed for vertical screens." Beijing Documentary Week will also see the release of quality documentaries and themed screenings.  It runs till Tuesday, September 22. An exhibition of French copperplate etching is underway in the Chinese capital, featuring collections from Li Keran Academy of Painting.  Over 200 copperplate prints on show from the Palace of Versailles use a technique that has a history of nearly 600 years and requires a certain degree of skill. And it's been practiced by some of the greats in European art. From German Renaissance figure DÃ¼rer to French impressionist Monet and even modernists Picasso and Matisse. The origins of copperplate etching can be traced back to Medieval Europe. An image is drawn on a copperplate then transferred onto paper using a printing press. The traditional method has evolved over centuries into an art form in its own right.Yang Hui, curator of Changyang Art Museum, said: "These copperplate prints are small and delicate. They are quite different from Chinese paintings, which are grand and magnificent. This exhibit gives people here in Beijing a chance to closely feel the charm of European art." Copper-plate etching arrived in China during the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) by way of European missionaries and gained popularity during the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), winning the emperor's favor in Emperor Qianlong's reign. Today, copperplate etching has become a form of cultural exchange between China and France. Guo Renzhi, a Beijing resident viewed the exhibition, said, "I'm in awe. The pieces are very detailed. The themes are colorful, even the ones on human figures and landscapes. The depictions are meticulous. When you look carefully, you'll see they're so vivid. Even if it's in black and white, you can still see how the brightness changes." The exhibit runs through October. An exhibition of French copperplate etching is underway in the Chinese capital, featuring collections from Li Keran Academy of Painting.  Over 200 copperplate prints on show from the Palace of Versailles use a technique that has a history of nearly 600 years and requires a certain degree of skill.

Before Sydney, it has toured across 50 cities around the world, presents Van Gogh's artwork across a series of projections. The multi-sensory experience includes a vibrant symphony of light, color, sound and fragrance, according to the organizer."We've all been stuck at home with our computers and our phones. We've all been streaming fantastic content that has no other way to get out there," said Emma Triggs, the promoter of Van Gogh Alive.  "But I think there is a real pent up demand for people to actually get out and experience something that is high quality production that gives an emotional outcome," she added. The exhibition brings art lovers back out after months of confinement. As of Friday, there are over 26, 800 confirmed cases in Australia and Victoria, the country's second-most populous state, also the coronavirus hot spot, reported five deaths from COVID-19 and 45 cases in the last 24 hours.  (With input from AFP)An immersive art exhibition named "Van Gogh Alive" is opening on Friday in Sydney.  The world-touring multimedia display was relocated to Sydney after a COVID-19 surge in Melbourne.

France, however, was still in a tough battle against the epidemic at that time. Both countries have overcome many difficulties to hold the exhibition, she added.At the exhibition is an innovative, immersive space that allows visitors to explore the origin and background stories about "Impression, Sunrise" via video clips and projections.It also holds a crossover collaboration with Team Wang, a home-grown streetwear label by Chinese pop star Jackson Wang, featuring a conceptual display space, "TEAM WANGÃMONET," on the third floor of the Bund One Art Museum, where the famous painting embraces a new interpretation and incorporates the images of landmarks in Shanghai and Paris like the Oriental Pearl Tower and Eiffel Tower.One of the greatest painters of the 20th century, Monet is a founder of French Impressionist painting and an unswerving advocate of the Impressionist style. His masterwork "Impression, Sunrise," which was created from a scene in the port of northwestern French city Le Havre, is credited with inspiring the name of the Impressionist movement.The exhibition will run through January 3, 2021.(Cover: A poster for the Claude Monet exhibition at the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai, China. /ambafrance.org)Groundbreaking artwork "Impression, Sunrise" by legendary French painter Claude Monet (1840-1926) made its China debut nearly 150 years after it was first shown at a Paris exhibition, stunning the world of art.Monet's 1872 masterpiece was unveiled on Wednesday at the Bund One Art Museum in Shanghai, while a special exhibition in honor of the French impressionist painter takes place from Thursday, September 17, where Chinese viewers can have a close look at some of Monet's classics.In addition to the world-famed "Impression, Sunrise," the exhibition is showcasing a total of 47 French paintings, including nine of Monet's masterworks collected in the Marmottan Monet Museum in Paris, such as "Charing Cross Bridge, Smoke in the Fog" (1902) and "Sailing Boat, Evening Effect" (1885).The sunrise symbolizes new birth and hope, which seems more meaningful than ever since people are facing the COVID-19 pandemic, said Marianne Mathieu, the Marmottan's curatorial director.Myriam Kryger, cultural attache of the French consulate general in Shanghai, said the idea to exhibit "Impression, Sunrise" in China started around April as prevention and control measures in China began producing positive results.

That is the traditional culture of the Yi people," said Fan Chengyuan, head of Xianrendong, a village tucked away in southwest China's Yunnan Province.Xianrendong, which means "fairy cave" in Chinese, was plagued by extreme poverty for a very long time. In the 1990s, it was nicknamed the "Pocket Village" because of people's dire living conditions. Villagers largely relied on growing crops and fishing for a living and their average annual income was only 300 yuan (44 U.S. dollars) â approximately one-eighth of the national poverty line which is 2,300 yuan (339 U.S. dollars).Things have changed since. In 2019, per capita income jumped to 40,000 yuan (5,902 U.S. dollars) on average, making the village the richest in Qiubei County.Developing rural tourism with ethnic elementsThe nearby scenic spot of Puzhehei first started developing its tourism sector in the 1990s. As changes began to set in, people in the surrounding villages slowly started to see tourism as a viable method for escaping poverty as well.Home to 196 households, Xianrendong is inhabited by Yi people â one of the largest ethnic minority groups in China. It also boasts clear lakes and lush vegetation, offering abundant tourism resources.Seeing the potential business opportunity, Fan quit his previous job in the county and returned to the village in 2005. He then took out a bank loan to renovate old houses and convert them into homestay properties with traditional ethnic Yi style.Keeping local traditions and ethnic culture alive has become key to the village's tourism development. Fan said they studied the traditional architectural styles and upgraded the designs to make the houses more habitable and comfortable. Since 2013, yellow-brick cottages of two or three stories have sprung up across the village. They also revived traditional customs and events, ethnic handicrafts as well as folk songs and dances. During special occasions, the resident art troupe would stage singing and dancing performances around the bonfire, presenting a cultural feast for the visitors. This return to traditional culture has successfully brought a boon to the once impoverished village.As the village rose to fame and popularity, more job opportunities followed, covering the industries of agriculture, manufacturing, transportation, catering, accommodation and others. Today, many young people have returned home to start their own businesses.Last year, 5.85 million trips by domestic and foreign visitors were made to the Puzhehei scenic spot, bringing in 5.25 billion yuan (775 million U.S. dollars) in tourism revenue.(Cover image designed by Du Chenxin)"The development of rural tourism cannot come at the expense of [a place's] essence.

The group acquired the brand and online assets of the UK company last November and for the relaunch of the new company it will retain the brand's familiar "Sunny Heart" logo.  In a statement, the new Thomas Cook said it was "COVID-19 ready," and will initially sell holidays to destinations on the UK government's safe travel corridor list including Italy, Greece and Turkey via its new website.Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 and was the world's oldest travel firm until it went bankrupt in September 2019, six months before the COVID-19 pandemic caused chaos for the travel industry. â¢ Fauchon fermÃ©?

Airlines and holiday companies across Europe and the world have been brought to their knees â including the world's biggest travel company TUI Group, which has had to rely on German state support."We are launching now clearly aware of the short-term challenges posed by the pandemic," said Alan French, Thomas Cook's UK CEO. "We and our Fosun backers are taking the long view and we want to offer choice, customization, and 24/7 on-holiday customer care to families who wish to travel now and in the future," he added.Chinese conglomerate Fosun said that this relaunch would support the growth of the brand in China."Thomas Cook has a proud heritage and after acquiring the brand last year we wanted to quickly return it to its home in the UK," Jim Qian, chairman and CEO of Fosun Tourism Group, said. "Supporting the growth of the brand in China and its relaunch in the UK is a big step in our plan to turn Thomas Cook into a global success story and a key milestone in the development of the Fosun Tourism Group's strategy," he added. Travel agency company Thomas Cook relaunched as an online-only holiday brand on Wednesday, backed by its new Chinese owners, Fosun Tourism Group, a year after the high-profile collapse of the British company left thousands stranded and employees out of work.Fosun Tourism Group â one of the world's largest leisure companies, which also owns Club Med â was the biggest shareholder in the original Thomas Cook. The group acquired the brand and online assets of the UK company last November and for the relaunch of the new company it will retain the brand's familiar "Sunny Heart" logo.  In a statement, the new Thomas Cook said it was "COVID-19 ready," and will initially sell holidays to destinations on the UK government's safe travel corridor list including Italy, Greece and Turkey via its new website.Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 and was the world's oldest travel firm until it went bankrupt in September 2019, six months before the COVID-19 pandemic caused chaos for the travel industry. â¢ Fauchon fermÃ©?

Now, with more exhibits dusting display cases and opening their doors again, a trip to the museum comes with mandatory mask-wearing and body temperature checks, hand sanitizer stations, social distancing markers and limits on visitor numbers. In the spirit of adapting to the new normal, museums have turned to the virtual space and museum patrons have warmed up to appreciating artwork from the comfort of their living room.This month, 16 museum curators from around the world sifted through their collections to choose their most favorite relics and shared them with a global audience in a nine-day art galore, which also featured discussions about the most pressing issues facing museums during these extraordinary times.The "Treasure Hunt Relay: Global Museum Director's Choice," which ran from September 6 to 15, was an initiative by The National Museum of China to help art lovers experience the power of culture wherever they were. The museum collaborated with 15 other cultural institutions across five continents to display prized artifacts and share the exciting history behind them, while weighing in on the opportunities and obstacles brought about by COVID-19.Every day, two curators held online presentations, revealing some of the cultural objects closest to their hearts. The relay began with the Beijing-based host museum and ended with the British Museum on Monday.About 90 percent of the museums worldwide were forced to temporarily shut down because of the coronavirus outbreak, and 13 percent could have their doors permanently closed, according to a May report jointly released by the UNESCO and International Council of Museums.The National Museum of China, for example, closed for 100 days before reopening on May 1, and currently caps the number of daily visitors at 8,000.In countries that rely heavily on tourism, the impact is even bigger. The number of visitors to the National Museum of Slovenia is now about 25 percent of that of last year. The Singapore-based Asian Civilizations Museum, which normally sees an average of 2,000 guests a day, is registering just 5 percent of the usual flow after reopening in June.The internet provided a way out for museums, which moved their exhibits and activities online in search of viable alternatives, with technology playing an important role in the conceptualization of fresh projects.The National Museum of China launched dozens of virtual exhibitions, including the first virtual exhibition on Chinese aerospace achievements, and a number of digital courses. The National Museum in Warsaw launched an app called Selfie, which allowed people to take pictures of their favorite works of art and upload them online. Meanwhile, the National Museum of Korea modified existing augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) projects and moved them online."These opportunities also get the public to tell us how they were experiencing the pandemic. These things in their own right will become important documents telling the story of how people coped with this age," said Dr. Mathew Trinca, curator of the National Museum of Australia.As palaces for sheltering human civilization, connecting the past, present and future, "museums are important at this time because they sustain our people and give them a sense of hope and optimism, drawn from the study of experiences of people in the past," said Trinca."I think this is important for us now to know how human beings are resilient and [how] we've overcome obstacles like these in our shared long history on earth," he added.Marriage of cultures"Virtual space, cloud exhibition and live broadcast can reach beyond the limits of time and space, so that audiences from all over the world can understand our museums, enjoy the exquisite collections of the museums, and appreciate the brilliance and splendor of different civilizations," said Dr. Wang Chunfa, curator of the National Museum of China, during the relay's opening presentation.The rich collections of the U.S.-based Smithsonian's National Museum of Asian Art is an example of the convergence of cultures. Dr. Chase F. Robinson, the curator, introduced two Chinese relics, the Square Ritual Food Cauldron (Fangding) from the 3,000-year-old Western Zhou period and the scroll "Nymph of the Luohe River" traditionally attributed to Chinese painter Gu Kaizhi who lived some 1,600 years ago."Just like the Silk Road connected East Asia with the near east of the Mediterranean world, we now live in a world in which we can recreate the Silk Road with some optical fibers. So optical fibers are now connecting East and West," said Robinson when referring to the "Treasure Hunt Relay" project.The National Museum of the Sultanate of Oman also shared their appreciation to the Chinese culture, showing three Ming-Dynasty bowls, which attests to the long-lasting relationship and sea trade on the maritime Silk Road that connected Oman and China."Today we are witnessing the idea of a global world coming under increased reassessment, criticism, and scrutiny. We see nationalism become stronger again and perhaps a certain tendency of countries isolating themselves from others. I believe strongly that this movement, which comes way out of the past of an ever-growing connection globally, is irreversible," said Dr. Hartwig Fischer, curator of the British Museum.Fischer said that the possibility of working with the National Museum of China is a huge chance with an impact on the development of globalization. "What we are able to show is that there are many interconnections of cultures that have driven the development of humankind," he said.An afternoon in a museum is not what it used to be â but that's not necessarily an awful thing.For most of the first half of the year, killing time musing over paintings and sculptures was an unthinkable activity amid coronavirus lockdown restrictions and stay-at-home orders.

Here, silk isn't just a luxury fabric; it's a way of life. The fine, delicately-patterned silk fabrics that were once the exclusive preserve of emperors are being reinvented for a mass market in the modern era. But does today's multi-billion-dollar industry owe its existence to the Chinese imperial family? No! It's thanks to the humble silkworm, which is at the heart of a lengthy process that depends on two key factors; preventing the moth from hatching from the cocoon, and perfecting the silkworms' diet. Only then, as you will see in the video, can the "ancient 3D printer" produce perfect silk thread. For more fascinating tales from China, follow us on @cgtntravelogue on Facebook and Instagram.Known as the "Home of Silk," Suzhou in east China's Jiangsu Province has a history of silk-making that dates back over 4,700 years.

China is now the EU's second-biggest trading partner behind the U.S. and the EU is China's biggest trading partner.However, there have been some disagreements between the two powers regarding the terms of their economic relationship.To ensure a "level playing field" for trade in the years ahead, both sides aim to sign the EU-China Comprehensive Agreement on Investment (CAI) by the end of the year but need to accelerate negotiations in order to meet that deadline.The agreement seeks to boost investment opportunities for European companies in China and Chinese companies in the EU by allowing firms from the two sides to be able to compete fairly.  COVID-19Since the start of the pandemic, both sides have shared ideas on their health response to COVID-19 and socio-economic recovery.The EU will promote its vision for a green recovery plan through which a portion of its stimulus fund would go towards environmentally friendly solutions and result in a more "sustainable, resilient and safer world." It is keen for China to adopt the same approach.The two sides also want to promote global cooperation in the field of treatment and vaccine research and support of the World Health Organization (WHO) â especially in light of the U.S. decision to leave the body â as it looks at the lessons learnt from the international health response to COVID-19.International cooperation and solidarity in terms of providing financial support for poorer African nations in their fight against the pandemic is another topic on which the two sides will hope to align. EnvironmentIn recent months, EU Executive Vice President (EVP) Frans Timmermans and Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng have spoken at length about climate change, the environment and how they can strengthen cooperation on these areas.The EU has earmarked a sizeable portion of its recovery package for green solutions to tackle climate change and China is also keen to ensure that its economic recovery from COVID-19 doesn't come at an environmental cost.China is currently working on its 14th Five-Year Plan, which will lay out government spending priorities over the next five years, with the environment expected to be a priority.

Some of the exhibits have been displayed for the first time.Since its completion in 1420, the Forbidden City served as the imperial palace of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) Dynasties, with 24 emperors living and ruling there. It stands today as the concentrated embodiment of thought about urban planning and palace construction in ancient China.Exhibition explores the Forbidden City's past 600 yearsFollowing the timeline, the exhibition has been divided into three parts with 18 major historical events. The first part explains why the Forbidden City was planned and laid out as it is through the relationship between the imperial palace and the capital city.The second part, "Inclusiveness," focuses on the Forbidden City's look in ethnic elements after it was taken over by ethnic Manchu ruler during the Qing Dynasty and Western architectural style after the 18th century.The third part shows how the imperial palace was given new vitality after becoming a public museum and World Heritage Site and welcoming visitors both from home and abroad."The Forbidden City has a cultural foundation of several thousands of years, and architectural basis on the traditions of the Tang and Song Dynasties before evolving into its today's form," said Ren Wanping, deputy director of the Palace Museum and the general curator of the exhibition."I hope visitors perceive that the Forbidden City contains Chinese philosophical thought and humanistic spirit from our ceaseless culture passed down from generation to generation," she added.Rarely-seen cultural relics exhibitedThe exhibition displays many rarely-seen cultural relics, including the Empress's Winter Court Coronet used on her wedding day and the Jewel-inlaid Gold Cup with "Jin'ou youngu" (Everlasting Territory) Inscription used by the emperor on Chinese New Year's Eve.The ten Glazed Animal Ornaments, which stand together only on the eaves of the Hall of Supreme Harmony, the largest and highest-level building in the Forbidden City, have been displayed together for the first time. On previous occasions, they were shown separately.Another treasure is the Lacquered Gauze, originally on the window partition in the south room of the Belvedere of Viewing Achievements (Fuwang ge). Painted with gold and silver, the exquisite fabric has six layers but it is easy for light to get through."This is the first time it is displayed for the public in the past over 200 years," said curator Zhang Jie, "Because of its fragile condition, it will be very hard for it to exhibit again in the future."The exhibition will last till November 15.(Cover image designer: Yin Yating)The Forbidden City, also known as the Palace Museum, on Thursday inaugurated an exhibition featuring its planning, layout, architecture and court life to celebrate its 600th birthday.Titled "Everlasting splendor: Six centuries at the Forbidden City," the exhibition displays more than 450 cultural relics and historical photos in three halls on top of the Meridian Gate, or the Forbidden City's main entrance.
