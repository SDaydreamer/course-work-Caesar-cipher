"The reasons for this are unclear," they said. "Lots of factors could affect the changing of numbers of sea turtles sighted," said Zara Botterell of the University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. "Climate change, prey availability and environmental disasters such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill could all influence turtle numbers and behavior."The record shows a dramatic increase in the turtle sightings in the 1980s and 1990s, which researchers attribute to the rising public interest in conservation activities and a better reporting mechanism. Of the seven different sea turtle species, six of them â green, hawksbill, kemp's ridley, leatherback, loggerhead, and the olive ridley â are found in both warm and cold water oceans in many countries. But the flatback turtles reside only in Australia, Indonesia and Southern Papua New Guinea.In the UK and Ireland, leatherback sea turtles are regularly spotted, making up 1,683 of the 1,997 sightings since 1910. These turtles visit the country's ocean during the summer months to feast on jellyfish. The record shows spotting of 240 loggerheads, 61 Kemp's ridley turtles during winter months. These turtles might have been carried on currents and are stranded in cold waters. But only 11 green turtles, one hawksbill and one olive ridley sightings were found in the record. Most of the recorded sightings of turtles in the UK and Ireland were along western and southern coasts. Of the 1,997 turtles sighted, 143 were "bycatch" (caught accidentally) in fishing lines, nets and ropes â and the large majority of these were released alive.But researchers claim that the sea turtle populations in the North Atlantic are mostly stable or increasing. "The apparent decrease may represent reduced reporting rather than fewer turtles in our seas," said Botterell."One reason for this could be that fewer fishing boats are at sea now than in the past â and fishers are the most likely people to see and report turtles," she added. Concerned over the depleting population of sea turtles, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has already declared kemp's ridley, hawksbil and green sea turtles critically endangered, seeking the intervention of the governments.Leatherback, olive ridley, green and loggerhead turtles have been placed under the endangered list. There is not enough data available about flatback turtles.  "We have been lucky to analyze this unique dataset that exists because Britain and Ireland are a real hotbed of engaged citizen science, said Professor Brendan Godley, who leads the Exeter Marine research group.

Up till the end of last year, eight out of nine projected goals had been accomplished in terms of concentration of fine particles, carbon emissions, water quality and the elimination of other chemical pollutants, Zhao Yingmin, vice minister of ecology and environment, said.Zhao told a press conference on October 21 that the number of days with excellent or good air quality in 2020 is expected to reach 84.5% by the end of the year, comfortably meeting the goal as outlined in the plan.On top of that, China has also contributed significantly to tackling climate change by controlling carbon emissions, promoting energy conservation, boosting the development of green energy and actively participating in international governance. Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP continues to decline and carbon intensity has decreased by 18.2% compared to 2015. Since 2010, sales of new energy cars have taken up 55 percent of the global figure, making China the country with the largest number of new energy vehicles in the world.Zhao said the achievement is the result of a continuously improved management system in the construction of ecological civilization and stronger laws and regulation. Having said that, challenges still remain. "Our industrial structure still relies heavily on the chemical industry, the energy industry still mainly relies on coal, and transportation is still highway-based," Zhao said. "Meanwhile, the world is undergoing profound and complex changes, the risks and challenges are growing every day, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. China's environmental protection is still an arduous task and the road ahead is long and tortuous.""We will continue our efforts in environmental protection and fighting against climate change based on the previous experiences in the next five years." (All photos via VCG. )(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)China experienced its greatest improvement in ecological and environmental protection from 2016 to 2020 after the completion of the main objectives and tasks outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.This year is the last year of the plan in which more attention has been given to environmental protection â targets for cutting carbon emissions and optimizing energy use.

The iconic marsupials, with some of the strongest jaws on the planet, were recently released into a sprawling, biodiversity-rich reserve in New South Wales."They are on their own. There's no food, no shelter, monitoring takes place four times a year through a tracking system and process, but the devils are out there," said Aussie Ark president Tim Faulkner.It's not known what led to the end of the devils' existence on the mainland."It may have been a mix of Aboriginal hunting, a mix of people bringing dingoes from Southeast Asia into Australia, it also might have been a couple of climate snaps that reduced prey availability for devils and potentially even disease," said Rewilding Australia director Rob Brewster.The devils continued to thrive in Tasmania until the 1990's when a facial tumor disease wiped out about 90 percent of the wild population.That prompted conservation efforts to increase disease-free numbers.It also eventually led to a plan involving species recovery specialists Aussie Ark to bring healthy Tasmanian devils to a unique, fenced wildlife sanctuary in Barrington Tops. "It is the most northerly part of Antarctic beach forest and sub-alpine Montagne swamps in Australia. It is the most southerly distribution of subtropical rainforests," said Faulkner. "It got an elevation change from sea level to 1,400 meters above sea level and so it is a mixing pot and a melting pot of biodiversity. It is home to 15 percent of all vertebrate fauna in Australia.â Australia has lost more mammals to extinction than any other country in the world, which experts say is largely due to introduced predators such as foxes and feral cats. They are counting on the devils to play a vital role in protecting other endangered species. "The devil has a role and impact on feral pests and it maintains balance within an ecosystem. So to bring them back to the mainland, they present no threat to humans, they present no threat to livestock. It is very unique in terms of a top order predator, but what they do critically in the absence of any other solution is control and disrupt numbers and populations of the feral fox and the feral cat, which are almost singularly related to almost all of our mammal extinctions," said Faulkner.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)After a 3,000-year absence, Tasmanian devils have made a return to Australia's mainland.

Thanks years of painstaking efforts, however, Qingyang has gradually brought the loss under control, Xinhua News Agency reported.The local water resources authority devised terraced fields and planted trees such as pines and sea buckthorn on slopes. At the bottom of the slopes, dams have been built to stop muddy water from flowing into the river.Data from the local soil and water conservation bureau showed the city lost about 98 million metric tonnes of soil last year, down by more than 40 percent from the average annual loss in the 1980s."Nevertheless, to maintain the declining trend nationwide, further efforts are needed, especially in areas severely hit by soil erosion such as Northeast and Southwest China and the Yangtze and Yellow river basins," the Ministry said. "Also, it is possible for areas that have been treated to revert into regions affected by soil erosion if results are not well maintained."A one-year campaign launched by the ministry last month targets illegal projects and activities that cause soil erosion in 71 cities and more than 450 counties in the Yellow River Basin. It will be followed by strict supervision measures."Theoretically, soil resources are renewable, but they will be drained under intense influence from human activities," stated the Ministry.Research by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geochemistry in 2006 found that it takes up to 3,000 years to form 1 centimeter of soil in parts of China with karst landforms, but that can be lost in just a few heavy rainstorms if not protected well.With nearly 30 percent of China's land currently affected by soil erosion, the ministry said there is an urgent need to minimize the depletion of soil because it causes harm to diversity and the economy, along with geological disasters and infrastructural damage.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said last year that soil erosion may reduce global crop yields by up to 10 percent by 2050 â the equivalent of removing millions of hectares of land from crop production.The Ministry said it will step up efforts to slow down soil erosion and prevent environmental damage caused by development activities.(Original editor: Li Hongyang)(All images via CFP)(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Further reduction of soil erosion in China is becoming increasingly difficult as the remaining affected areas â which have seen four decades of progress that have reduced the extent of the problem and its intensity â are "tougher and more complicated" to deal with, the Ministry of Water Resources has said.The latest data, released by the Ministry in August, said 2.71 million square kilometers of land experienced soil erosion last year, down by almost 1 percent from 2018 and 26 percent from the 1980s.The improvement was due to various water conservancy projects, including transforming slope farmland that is more likely to lose soil when it rains into a combination of terraced farmland, forests and grassland.For example, the Loess Plateau, located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, remains one of the most severely eroded areas in China due to its hilly terrain and heavy summer rains.In the 1980s, about 10 percent of the soil that entered the Yellow River each year came from Qingyang, a city on the plateau in Gansu Province.

The Hamo Brothers are two Hani singers from Nanuo village in Yuanjiang County in southwest China's Yunnan Province. In the Hani language, "hamo" means twin. The Hamo Brothers are twin brothers who are dedicated to preserving their ethnic group's culture. They often visit the elderly in the village to collect stories and create songs based on the ancient melody of the Hani people. About the "Go!

And then potentially the chemistry of the river is damaged as well."Prior to the arrival of sewage, the Chess's riverbed was lined with minerals to create perfect conditions for fish and wildlife to thrive. It remains popular with fishermen and dog walkers and is a haven for brown trout, the endangered water vole and many other species â but everything that depends on it is under threat from pollution.  The sewage discharge is one key reason the River Chess failed chemical pollution tests, according to a recent UK government report by the Environment Agency. But data gathered from lakes, rivers and streams all across England over three years up paint a grim picture nationwide. Only 14 percent of rivers were found to have a "good ecological status" and none proved to be entirely pollution free. The report says population growth, land use and climate change are all contributing to the problem. "Obviously there is a widespread and endemic problem with pollution in our rivers," says Mark Lloyd, CEO of the Rivers Trust, an umbrella organization that works to protect UK rivers. "And really that's from two sources, principally â from sewage pollution and from agriculture. There's also a problem with urban pollution and run-off from roads. We have solved some of those gross pollution issues from the past, but we have new threats, we have new emerging chemicals, things like flame retardants and PCBs and things that are very persistent in the environment."Water companies were also criticized in a separate recent government report by the Environment Agency. Four out of nine companies failed to meet pollution standards. Many are struggling with outdated infrastructure, that no longer has the capacity for a growing population and more frequent extreme weather events. CLICK: CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING INTRICATELY FOLDED STRANDS OF DNAIn Ewell, in suburban Surrey, two large storm tanks are designed to divert their contents directly into the nearby Hogsmill river in the event of heavy rain. "Our system seems to routinely cause those overflows, because the system is so overloaded with the proliferation of hard surfaces and also population growth," says Lloyd."We're really asking our sewers to do a job they weren't designed for. And so, we need to design sewers fit for the future, including climate change. It's been designed around a system that is hundreds of years old. It combines surface water with foul sewage. That really does need to be completely reverse engineered."Thames Water, which operates the sewage storm tanks in Ewell and the water treatment works along the River Chess, says that in some cases sewage discharge is unavoidable."We work hard to minimize storm discharges, while also looking at how we can improve the system for the future, including reducing groundwater infiltration and increasing capacity," the company said in a statement. "We've also invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills occur and help us plan improvements."  Along the River Chess, regular monitoring of pollution is done by volunteers, with the help of equipment loaned by Queen Mary University of London. Jennings believes the government should be helping more. "They're not looking at this as they should do and they're not protecting our rivers, as we believe they should do," he says. "So, we have to intervene and push the Environment Agency, push government, push the water companies to take action."The government says it is trying to tackle the problem. A spokesperson for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The latest water classification results show we need to go further and faster to protect our water environment, in particular chalk streams like the River Chess. That's why we have set up a task force to set out clear proposals to reduce the frequency and volumes of sewage discharged by storm overflows."Whatever the solutions, they are likely to take time to implement and for real improvement to show.

"So, this isn't exactly something new, but it has escalated and become a lot more severe because of the pandemic and so what we are seeing is there has been a bit of backlash in terms of creating more negative attitudes towards bats."Following the outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998, which was transmitted from fruit bats to pigs and then to humans, most research in the country has focused on the flying fox and other bats' role as possible vectors of disease."I knew from research done in other countries that they actually played as very major and important role in maintaining the health of our tropical ecosystems," said Dr. Sheema, co-founder of Rimba, a non-profit group of scientists."At the same time, I found out that the flying foxes are disappearing very rapidly because of human activities, such as hunting and clearing forests and mangroves."They are not just hunted for food and medicine. Fruit farmers often kill them too."It just seemed like this was a very important issue that was being overlooked and ignored," Sheema said.Rimba's Project Pteropus â pteropus being the Latin name for the flying fox â aims to fill that knowledge gap.Hauling himself up a towering durian tree with rope pulley, a man sets up a camera to capture night time images of the bats' activities.Farmers of the much-prized durian fruit had long believed that the bats knocked the durian flowers off the tree, reducing their yields. In fact, the opposite is true."They're  playing this very important role in durian farms where they're helping to actually pollinate the durian flowers," Sheema said."Malaysia flying foxes play this unique dual role in a number of ecosystems, such as rainforests, mangroves, peat swamps, freshwater swamps. They're both seed dispersers and also pollinators. So, when they carry fruits away, they're actually helping to carry seeds away and helping to plant these seeds in other parts of the landscape, but then they're also visiting flowers to drink nectar as well, collecting pollen and then transferring the pollen somewhere else."Still, their furry canine-like faces have done little to endear them to fruit farmers."Fruit farmers have complained about flying foxes feeding on the fruit crops in the past, and they believe this necessitates eradicating the flying foxes."Project Pteropus has set out to research the role the flying fox bats play in the ecosystem to counter the negative perceptions â and the unnecessary killing. Rimba has produced posters and animated videos to reach out to the public and gone to the ground to educate farmers.Eric Chong runs an ecolodge and fruit orchard on the northern island of Penang."At my neighbor's farm, they are actually putting up nets to trap the bats, especially around their fruit trees," he said."When we first got the farm, our caretaker had advised us to leave the bats alone, they actually will help the farm, so we left the bats alone, not having much proof of actually what bats do."Then Rimba showed him the night camera video of the bats interacting with the durian flowers."When I saw that video of the bats pollinating the durian flowers, yeah, I was very convinced of their beneficial impact," Chong said.He believes other farmers would be too.But Rimba knows there's more than just misperception at work here. Flying foxes aren't dubbed fruit bats for no reason."We need to start investigating and trialling mitigation methods in partnership with the farmers so that we can look into ways that we can help protect the fruit crops from the bats without actually killing the bats," Sheema said.Rimba is also reaching out to educate the broader public too."Anyone who might be hunting or killing flying foxes, they actually need to stop this kind of practice because if the flying fox disappears from the ecosystem, if they disappear from Malaysia, they could be very negative impacts on all of us on our well-being, on the economy, on industries."As for fears about bats as spreaders of deadly disease, "All they need to do to avoid infection risk from bats is really to just leave bats alone, not to consume them, not to disturb them, not to kill them."(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)From a public relations standpoint, it's not a good time to be a bat â much less a member of the flying fox fruit bat species linked to the spread of COVID-19."Bats have always had this negative reputation in general," said Malaysian researcher Sheema Abdul Aziz.

The world is curious about how China will achieve this ambitious goal. Alok Gupta spoke to Professor Li Zheng and He Jiankun from the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University about how China plans to reduce emissions to zero. Below are excerpts from the interview edited for clarity. What are the major challenges for China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060?China's carbon dioxide emissions would reach its peak by 2030, which means we have 30 years to meet the carbon neutrality deadline. But developed countries have 50-70 years, so our future emissions reduction process will be very urgent.The share of manufacturing in China's economy is much higher than those in developed countries, resulting in a relatively high per capita consumption of energy. Manufacturing consumes a large amount of power, which is, mainly produced by burning fossil fuels â coal, oil and gas â resulting in emissions. We are already shifting to green energy like solar and wind. There is a need to develop a digital economy, high-tech industries, and restructure industries to curb fossil fuels, boost low-carbon energy, and develop new and renewable energy sectors to bring down emission levels.Is there a timeline for reduction in the use of fossil fuels, especially coal? The share of coal in primary energy consumption has declined to nearly 57 percent, and non-fossil energy has exceeded 15 percent. Thus, by 2050, non-fossil energy may account for more than 90 percent of the total power generation. Only in this way can we make it possible to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060; under such a scenario, national five-year-plans become crucial. Thus, the 14th five-year plan could be vital to knowing the path our policymakers are paving to meet carbon neutrality and ensure economic growth.Which key sectors would have to reduce their emissions drastically?The power industry is the largest carbon emitter, accounting for about 40 percent of the nation's total emissions. Among the energy-intensive sectors, including iron and steel, cement, and building materials, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, and manufacturing, are directly or indirectly responsible for about 45 percent of the total national emissions. In addition to reducing final demand through a circular economy, these industries will have to adopt smart technologies and cleaner fuel to reduce their carbon footprint. We think that the power industry should take the lead and become the first one to decarbonize. How will the coronavirus pandemic impact China's plan to become carbon neutral?There is a Chinese proverbäººæ è¿è, å¿æè¿å¿§, which means, those who do not plan for the future will soon find trouble at their doorstep.Carbon neutrality is a long-term plan that will eventually help in preventing pandemics in the future. Moreover, biodiversity loss because of climate change could be strongly linked to viral outbreaks. The world will tide over the COVID-19 but preventing global temperature rise beyond 1.5-2 degrees Celsius would have many benefits, including reducing extreme weather events like wildfires, typhoons and floods. The current pandemic helps us to prepare for the commitments made during the Paris Climate Change Agreement.Apart from controlling industrial emissions, what else should be done to meet carbon neutrality?  We will also have to strengthen forestry, land use, and agriculture, which absorb carbon dioxide and boost biodiversity. At present, China has the world's largest planted forest and along with agriculture, wetlands, grasslands, and effective land use, it helps absorb about 800 million tons of carbon dioxide. This sector can help create green jobs and bring people closer to nature. What will be the impact of China's decision to go carbon neutral on the annual Climate Change Summit in Glasgow next year? We believe that President Xi Jinping's announcement would motivate other countries to strengthen their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce their emissions and boost the morale of the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. China is taking a responsible role in international and global governance and leading global efforts to fulfill the Paris Climate Agreement, sustainable development and economic recovery.He Jiankun is vice director, National Expert Committee on Climate Change and Academic Chair of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development, Tsinghua UniversityLi Zheng, is executive vice president of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development and Director of the Laboratory of Low Carbon Energy, Tsinghua UniversityVideo Editors: Oscar Margain, Gong Zhe(Cover: The City skyline is seen amid smog ahead of Chinese Lunar New Year in Beijing, China February 13, 2018. /Reuters)In a surprise announcement, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would become a carbon-neutral country by 2060 during his virtual address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) last month.

Enthusiasts around the world have praised the fermented tea for some of its possible health benefits. CGTN's Nick Mudimba visited a kombucha maker based on the outskirts of Nairobi and brings us this report.It's said you are what you eat. Many Kenyans have been turning to healthier diets and working out to stay in shape. Away from the world of sugary sodas and chemical preservatives, Andrew Wachira is making and selling an alternative beverage.Andrew Wachira, Founder, Kombucha Kenya says: "Kombucha is tea that is fermented and is fermented by good bacteria, we also call them probiotics, and good bacteria will act on the sweetened tea and for seven days or so it will turn out into this drink we call Kombucha."The drink is said to also contain antioxidants which can kill harmful bacteria and boost the immune system.The ingredients Wachira uses to make kombucha include tea bags, sugar, culture or SCOBY an acronym that means Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast, a starter liquid of a small amount of kombucha that has been brewed from a previous batch.He adds, "Steep the tea bags into hot water, steep it for a couple of minutes and thereafter you can add sugar, you can even add sugar while the tea is hot, the sugar can be more soluble in the tea and afterwards you now have to put it into the container that you are going to brew it â¦ Once you put the sweetened tea into the fermentation bucket or the container all you need to do is to add more water so that it can take the temperature down to room temperature, after that we now add the starter liquid and the scoby, the starter liquid comes first you give it a good stir and thereafter you add the scoby and you place it on top of that brew and you cover it."The tea which comes in many flavours is left to ferment for two or three weeks. Many of Wachira's clients come to him directly to pick up their supply.With nutritionists warning of the health risks associated with sweetened fizzy drinks like sodas, demand is moving towards healthier beverages like Kombucha - and Wachira says it's the health benefits that keep his clients coming back for more. Kombucha has been gaining popularity in Kenya.

Skin whitening and the issue of colorism has been linked to a complex history of colonialism and slavery. And as CGTN's Patrick Oyet reports buying of skin lightening creams continues despite government ban.Each individual bleaching here has their own reasons for doing so."Skin whitening is good, I like it because it makes me look like a white lady, but I don't want to overdo it, I just want to maintain how I look now, my advice to those whitening their skin is that don't apply the much at one, whitening is a process that takes time," Joyce Keji Emmanuel, Juba Resident says.Before independence in 2011, more light-skinned Arab Sudanese ruled a then-united Sudan out of Khartoum.The main goal of successive regimes in Khartoum was to Islamize and Arabize Sudan. The blacks from the Southern Part of the country were religiously and politically marginalized and suffered discrimination due to their skin colour.Many women and girls opted to whiten their skin to look more like the Arab population.Bleaching is not limited to women and girls, some men in South Sudan are also whitening their skin.But some people resist the idea of whitening their skin.Susan Kim Otor, Coordinator, defy-hate-now submits: "I believe in my creator, and he did not make a mistake when he created me black, and I believe I am beautiful in my natural color. So, why destroy it with such unnatural things."However, medical experts are warning of the dangers of skin whitening."Some patients also develop deposition of these toxic agents into some organs like the liver because by the way you apply it on the skin, it's absorbed in the blood, taken by the blood circulation system and deposited into various organs, that's the worst part that many people are experiencing," Dr. Francis Oromo, a medic argues.The government says it has halted the sale and use of the cosmetics for whitening skin across the country.Peter Baak, Director General, Drug and Food Control Authority, South Sudan says, "We have banned the use of body whitening creams, the policy is clear and we will continue to make sure that our market in South Sudan is free from unwanted cosmetics to ensure that our people are not harmed."However, most of Juba's markets have several stores, where people can buy bleaching agents.And people like Joyce Keji continue to access them and whiten their skin. Skin bleaching is a popular practice with many South Sudanese - especially among but not limited to, women and girls.

Another 67,000 customers in Texas were without power, while Mississippi reported almost 34,000 outages.About 15,000 were without power in Georgia and South Carolina, where Delta was expected to dump rain Sunday before moving up the East Coast.The storm still had 30 mph winds early Sunday, though it was expected to weaken significantly by early Monday, according to the National Weather Service.Northeast Georgia and the western portion of Virginia and the Carolinas could see up to 6 inches of rain, creating flash flooding risks across the region, the weather service said. The Central Appalachians and southern New Jersey could get drenched as well, forecasters said.Tornadoes are possible across the Carolinas on Sunday, the weather service said. Flash flooding is possible from north Georgia to southern Virginia.Five tornadoes were reported in the Atlanta metro area. In Covington, east of Atlanta, a suspected tornado left one person with minor injuries and damaged a homeless shelter, displacing 30 people, the city's emergency management director, Jody Nolan, told CNN."Even if it wasn't quite as powerful as Hurricane Laura it was much bigger," Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday. "Obviously, this was a very serious, very large and powerful storm that produced significant amounts of damage."(With input from agencies)At least half a million households and businesses were in the dark on Sunday morning after Hurricane Delta, which hit Louisiana, weakened to a post-tropical cyclone and headed across the Southeast.Most of the customers without electricity, about 360,000 of them, were in Louisiana, where the hurricane made landfall Friday, according to poweroutage.us.

Huayao Dai people are part of the Dai ethnic group, who mostly dwell in Jiasa township of Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County, southwest China's Yunnan Province. The closed geographic environment of Xinping has made it possible for Huayao Dai people to keep their traditional customs such as worshiping gods, tattooing and tooth dyeing. For the older generation of Huayao Dai women, the black teeth are a symbol of beauty and dental health.

Job losses, illness, financial difficulties, and even some people's fear of contracting the virus from pets, led to a rise in animal abandonments in the UK. When people were furloughed or working from home, the adoption rate went up. During the first week of lockdown Battersea Dogs and Cats Home reported 86 dogs and 69 cats were rehomed, rising from 42 and 29 respectively in the same period last year.While this might look like a positive trend, and these animals went to good homes, it is too early to say that lockdown united all abandoned animals across the UK with new owners for the long term. When people go back to work their priorities change and newly-adopted pets can be at risk of ending up in a shelter because of the lack of time and commitment from their owners. Compared with the same period last year, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) charity received four times more calls from prospective owners when the UK went into lockdown â but now the organization has been receiving calls from those who want to return their new pets.  "People have gone back to work and then suddenly realized that this puppy doesn't fit into their life any more," says Herchran Boal, an RSPCA inspector in the West Midlands. "It's almost as if they didn't think about that. And that's very sad because a pet is for life, it's not just for the lockdown period."During the first three months of the lockdown the RSPCA received almost 3,500 calls â 40 a day â about abandoned animals, including 1,509 dogs, 1,165 cats, 299 small animals such as hamsters and guinea pigs and 275 exotic animals. The closure of RSPCA centers, shortage of staff and a surge of abandoned animals put the charity in a very difficult position. "I've been an inspector for 20 years and this is the worst that anything has affected the RSPCA," says Boal. "We have a service that was being provided for 24 hours a day but due to the pandemic we've had to close our control centers overnight. We have always been an organization that's gone on 24/7 because animals don't get sick just nine to five. People need us all the time."As a charity, the RSPCA relies on public donations â but fundraising events had to be stopped and the donations from the public have slowed down due to the COVID-19 crisis. "The NHS have done an amazing job and they're really great," says Boal. "But let's not forget the animals. The animals are what keep some people going, really. The pets are very important to them."Video editing: Riaz JugonThe COVID-19 crisis not only transformed our lives, it also had an impact on the welfare of animals.

Even after they die, they stand strong for another thousand years. And when they collapse, they don't decompose for an additional thousand years.Diversifolious in Latin means varied-leaved. The shape of the leaves changes with time. Younger trees have narrow leaves so they don't need too much water to grow. Full-fledged trees have rounder and bigger leaves to gravitate more sunlight.Rose willow can often be found around these poplars. Locals call rose willow and diversifolious poplar "couple plants" of the desert.In addition, these poplars provide durable and sturdy building material.

They have eliminated agricultural export subsidies, enhanced market access for cotton and cotton by-product exports from LDCs and worked to enable developing countries to benefit more from every step of the cotton value chain. Nevertheless, it is widely believed that more can be done to level the playing field for cotton producers, especially in LDCs.The annual World Cotton Day celebrations are an opportunity to recognize the importance of this global commodity â and to push forward with positive economic, development and sustainable trade policies.For the 2020 edition, the WTO has established a dedicated webpage that brings together contributions from ministers, ambassadors, heads of organizations and the private sector on the importance of cotton and the relevance of World Cotton Day to their respective countries and organizations.  The WTO has also set up a stand in its headquarters to celebrate cotton, with the distribution of souvenirs and information on cotton to staff and delegates.The importance of cotton to Cotton-4 countriesCotton production is the source of livelihood to over 4 million farmers in Africa, of which around 1 million are located in the Cotton-4 countries.For the Cotton-4 countries, cotton earnings represent between 8 to 12% of their annual Gross Domestic Production (GDP) and account for up to 40% of their total export revenue.Current world cotton production is above 26 million tonnes from which more than 8 million tonnes are traded globally every year.The Cotton-4 countries export approximately 800,000 tonnes of cotton per year, totalling around 10% of the total world cotton exports.(With input from World Trade Organization)The spotlight was shone on the importance of cotton for millions of farmers, processors and traders globally as the  World Trade Organization marked the first anniversary of World Cotton Day.The Cotton-4 group (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali) initiated the cotton sectoral initiative at the WTO with the aim of improving the global trade rules as they relate to cotton, and to shed light on the many linkages among trade, cotton and development.World Cotton Day aims to highlight the numerous gains enabled by international trade in cotton, including: selling to consumers abroad; increasing foreign exchange earnings; attracting investment in local businesses; employing more workers; and fostering growth and technology transfer in the wider economy.While widely appreciated as a fibre used to make textiles and clothes, cotton is also used in the production of edible oils, animal feed and fuel. Cotton production, processing, and trade represent a key source of income for a number of economies worldwide.In many African least developed countries (LDCs), cotton is key to job creation and economic stability.At the WTO, members have taken meaningful steps to promote cotton trade.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts.

Much of the continent saw above average temperatures for September, especially southeastern Europe.Western Europe also experienced bursts of record-breaking heatwaves last month, with temperatures reaching unusually high levels.The northern French city of Lille in mid-September had its hottest September day since records began in 1945, while cities in Germany and the UK experienced the highest September temperatures in four years.In Russia, according to the state weather service, last month was the country's hottest September in the 130 years since records began.  The Russian Hydrometeorology Center said almost every part of the country had experienced temperatures that were several degrees above average, with the largest anomalies of temperatures exceeding the average by five to six degrees Celsius observed in north Eurasia near the Arctic Circle.C3S scientists also found that in the Siberian Arctic, temperatures continued to be warmer than average in September, continuing a heatwave that affected different parts of the vast region since early spring."Although Siberia and the Arctic have large temperature fluctuations from year to year, the relative warmth observed this year has been unusual in its magnitude and persistence," Copernicus said in a statement. Melting Arctic sea iceAlongside the increasing temperatures in the Arctic, C3S also confirmed that sea ice levels have been melting and are in decline. The figures show that the average Arctic sea ice extent for September was the second lowest recorded, after September 2012.  Sea ice extent in the Arctic has declined noticeably since 1979 when satellite observations began. The trend can be seen throughout the year, but especially in September when the ice cover reaches its minimum extent for the year before starting to build up again."In 2020, there was an unusually rapid decline in Arctic sea ice extent during June and July, in the same region where above average temperatures were recorded, preconditioning the sea ice minimum to be particularly low this year," Carlo Buontempo, Director of Copernicus Climate Change Service said."The combination of record temperatures and low Arctic sea ice in 2020 highlight the importance of improved and more comprehensive monitoring in a region warming faster than anywhere else in the world," he added. Globally, September 2020 was 0.05 degrees Celsius warmer than the same month last year â which had been the warmest on record, according to scientists from Copernicus.In addition, temperatures in the Siberian Arctic continue to be much above average and Arctic sea ice is at its second lowest extent since satellite records began.  Temperatures in September were well above average in many regions across the globe, including off the coast of northern Siberia, and many parts of Europe, with many countries experiencing their warmest September on record.The numbers analyzed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service show that the month was 0.63 degrees Celsius above the average September temperatures of the standard thirty-year climatological reference period (1981-2010).This means that as well as being warmer than last year, this September was also 0.8 degrees Celsius warmer than September 2016, the second-warmest on record.  Europe's September heatwavesAcross Europe, September average temperatures reached a record high, about 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous warmest September of 2018.

The downpours have destroyed houses and washed away roads on the border between the two countries near Nice.These storms have been attributed to climate change and scientists believe they're likely to increase in frequency and volume in the years ahead â but hope natural interventions could dramatically reduce their impact. CLICK: HOW THE EDUCATION SECTOR IS ADAPTING TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS  The results of the study showed that in areas where new woodlands have been planted, the ability of soil to absorb water was almost double that of areas with no trees.This means that huge quantities of rainwater could be more readily absorbed by trees, rather than it simply running over the surface and into rivers where it subsequently causes severe flooding.The study's authors say their findings show the planting of more woodlands in upland areas could be an effective and natural flood management tool.Thomas Murphy, who led the research as part of his PhD, said: "Many UK upland areas have a history of soil compaction and the aim of our study was to define how quickly this nature-based solution could affect that."  He added: "People perhaps think that trees need to be mature in order for them to have beneficial environmental effects. But across our four test sites, we showed they can make significant improvements to soil properties within just 15 years of establishment, meaning it can be a viable option for flood prevention in a relatively modest time frame."This nature-based solution could be extremely timely, given the commitment of the UK government to plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 and other environmental schemes designed to enhance carbon retention, biodiversity and flood prevention. But scientists have warned that new woodlands will require careful placement if the benefits are to be maximized. The research concluded that that steep hillsides on the edge of upland areas provide the most effective location for tree plantations to serve as an effective flood-prevention tool.  Planting new woodlands in upland areas could help bring an end to flash flooding in the UK within 15 years, according to a new study published by the University of Plymouth. The UK is just one of several European countries to have been hit by serious flooding in recent years, prompting  research into how trees could be used to absorb rainwater.In February, large parts of the English Midlands and Yorkshire were left submerged in water after Storm Dennis hit the UK, resulting in serious damage to local communities and several deaths.Storm Alex also caused nearly a year's rainfall to come down on France and Italy in the space of just 12 hours this week.

Some of the animals, such as sheep, have not yet been studied with infection tests, so this does not confirm the species can indeed be infected.Lead author Christine Orengo, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "We wanted to look beyond just the animals that had been studied experimentally, to see which animals might be at risk of infection and would warrant further investigation and possible monitoring."The animals we identified may be at risk of outbreaks that could threaten endangered species or harm the livelihoods of farmers. The animals might also act as reservoirs of the virus, with the potential to reinfect humans later on, as has been documented on mink farms."The research team also performed more detailed structural analyses for certain animals, to gain a better understanding of how infection risks may differ across animal species. By comparing their findings to other experimental data, they set thresholds to predict which animals are at risk of infection, and which ones most likely cannot be infected.They found that most birds, fish, and reptiles do not appear to be at risk of infection, but the majority of the mammals they reviewed could potentially be infected.Orengo added: "The details of host infection and severity of response are more complex than just the interactions of the spike protein with ACE2, so our research is continuing to explore interactions involving other host virus proteins."  The team's findings mostly agree with experiments conducted in living animals and with reported cases of infections. They predict possible infection in domestic cats, dogs, mink, lions, and tigers, all of which have had reported cases, as well as ferrets and macaques, which have been infected in laboratory studies.First author, Su Datt Lam, who specializes in structural and molecular biology at UCL and the National University of Malaysia, said: "Unlike laboratory-based experiments, the computational analyses we devised can be run automatically and rapidly. Therefore, these methods could be applied easily to future virus outbreaks that, unfortunately, are becoming more common due to human encroachment into natural habitats."  Co-author Joanne Santini, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "To protect animals, as well as to protect ourselves from the risk of one day catching COVID-19 from an infected animal, we need large-scale surveillance of animals, particularly pets and farm animals, to catch cases or clusters early on while they're still manageable."It may also be important to employ hygiene measures when dealing with animals, similar to the behaviours we've all been learning this year to reduce transmission and for infected people to isolate from animals as well as from other people." Numerous animals may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to a large study modeling how the virus might infect different species' cells.The study, published in Scientific Reports and led by researchers at University College London (UCL) reports evidence that 26 animals regularly in contact with people may be susceptible to infection.The researchers investigated how the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 could interact with the ACE2 protein it attaches to when it infects people.The focus of the investigation was whether mutations in the ACE2 protein in 215 different animals, which make it different from the human version, would reduce the stability of the binding complex between the virus protein and host protein. Binding to the protein enables the virus to gain entry into host cells; while it is possible the virus might be able to infect animals via another pathway, it is unlikely based on current evidence that the virus could infect an animal if it cannot form a stable binding complex with ACE2.  The researchers found that for some animals, such as sheep and great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos, many of which are endangered in the wild), the proteins would be able to bind together just as strongly as they do when the virus infects people. Some of the animals, such as sheep, have not yet been studied with infection tests, so this does not confirm the species can indeed be infected.Lead author Christine Orengo, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "We wanted to look beyond just the animals that had been studied experimentally, to see which animals might be at risk of infection and would warrant further investigation and possible monitoring."The animals we identified may be at risk of outbreaks that could threaten endangered species or harm the livelihoods of farmers. The animals might also act as reservoirs of the virus, with the potential to reinfect humans later on, as has been documented on mink farms."The research team also performed more detailed structural analyses for certain animals, to gain a better understanding of how infection risks may differ across animal species. By comparing their findings to other experimental data, they set thresholds to predict which animals are at risk of infection, and which ones most likely cannot be infected.They found that most birds, fish, and reptiles do not appear to be at risk of infection, but the majority of the mammals they reviewed could potentially be infected.Orengo added: "The details of host infection and severity of response are more complex than just the interactions of the spike protein with ACE2, so our research is continuing to explore interactions involving other host virus proteins."  The team's findings mostly agree with experiments conducted in living animals and with reported cases of infections.

French authorities said at least eight people were missing, including two firemen whose vehicle was carried away by a swollen river, according to local witnesses.  Army and helicopters join the effortThe French army and hundreds of rescuers were deployed to search for the missing, including using helicopters to transport aid and evacuate people where possible. An emergency services spokesman in France said that around 40 people stranded on roads by the landslides had sheltered in an old train station and then been airlifted to safety.The storm ravaged several villages around the city of Nice on the French Riviera. Nice mayor Christian Estrosi called it the worst flooding disaster in the area for more than a century, after flying over the area by helicopter. "The roads and about 100 houses were swept away or partially destroyed," he told French news channel BFM."I do not hide from you our deep concern about the final outcome of this episode," said prime minister Jean Castex, adding "I have been particularly shocked by what I saw today." Amid concerns that the death toll could rise, Castex said that the government had triggered its emergency plan for handling natural disasters.  In Breil-sur-Roya, a French village close to the Italian border, houses were buried in mud and turned-over cars stuck in the riverbed. Rescue efforts were concentrated on the Roya valley where roughly 1,000 firefighters, backed by helicopters and the army, resumed their search for survivors and helped people whose homes were destroyed or inaccessible.Eric Ciotti, a member of French parliament who is from one of the worst affected villages in the area, Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie, said several villages were cut off in the mountainous region's steep-sided valleys. "The situation is catastrophic in some communes," Ciotti said.Meteo France said that 500 millimeters of rain was registered over 24 hours in Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie, with close to 400 millimeters falling in several other towns â the equivalent of more than three months of rain at this time of the year.Authorities in the southern Alpes-Maritimes region had been placed on alert Friday and around 12,000 people in three valleys to the north of Nice were without power early Saturday afternoon. France has now declared the region a natural disaster zone. Houses 'perched above the void'Roads had been washed away by the waters leaving buildings teetering above the voids. "You can also see a few houses that are perched above the void because the riverbed has washed away the road," said a fire brigade spokesman."We have actually had houses wiped out," said Alpes-Maritimes prefect Bernard Gonzalez. "What we are going through is extraordinary.""My three-story house, it's in the river," said villager Sandra Dzidt, 62, who had to flee the floods dressed only in her nightgown. "All I have left is a tiny piece of wall and a door."  "We are thunderstruck. We saw the (river) Vesubie burst its banks â everything was swept away, including part of the old iron bridge," said Serge Franco, a resident of the Alpes-Maritimes village Roquebilliere."My house is habitable but half of my land has been swept away," said another resident, Guillaume Andre, who was evacuated overnight but returned to see the devastation after daybreak."I lost everything but we are alive," said Roquebilliere resident Jennyfer. "There must be one room left in my house.""The firefighters did not have enough rope, and even with our rope we could not reach the house, so it was too late to get to them and the house was suddenly swept away," added resident Patrick Theus.Gonzalez called on the families of the missing not to give up hope. "Just because their loved ones haven't been able to get in touch doesn't mean that they have been taken by the storm," he said. Many landline and some mobile phone services were disrupted, with some villages using satellite phones to communicate with rescue services.Despite forecasts of more rain, Gonzalez insisted that rescue efforts were to continue throughout Sunday. "The helicopter procession will continue all day long," he said.  Director of civil protection JÃ©rÃ©my Crunchant said there was heavier rainfall than on 3 October 2015, when floods caused the death of 20 people in and around the French Riviera city of Cannes.The presidents of Italy's Piedmont and Liguria regions signed a joint letter calling on the government to declare a state of emergency with several villages cut off. The mayor of the northern Italian city of Ventimiglia, Gaetano Scullino, said "a disaster of this kind has not happened since 1958."Cirio added Italy was already struggling to cope with the effects of the coronavirus which has left some 36,000 dead and shattered the economy over the past six months."We are already in an extraordinary situation," he said. "Because of the pandemic the region will this year receive 200 million euros ($234 million) less in tax receipts. If the state does not intervene we shall not recover."Meanwhile in Venice, a long-delayed flood barrier system including a network of 78 artificial dykes successfully protected the lagoon city from a high tide for the first time on Saturday, bringing huge relief following years of repeated inundations. Storm Alex has left at least three people dead and eight missing in southern France and northern Italy, bringing record rainfall in places and causing heavy flooding that swept away roads, damaged homes and left thousands without power.In Italy, at least two people died â a volunteer firefighter in the Aosta Valley and a man whose car was swept into the River Sesia in northern Italy after a road subsided.The water level in the River Po jumped by three meters in just 24 hours and officials in the Piedmont region reported a record 630 millimeters of rain in just 24 hours in Sambughetto, close to Italy's border with Switzerland. Dozens of firefighters were trying to reach one village by train after the road was shut, while neighboring Switzerland was also battered with record rainfall and powerful gusts, forcing the closure of roads and mountains. CLICK: THE CREWLESS, SOLAR-POWERED 'MAYFLOWER' MAKING THE SAME JOURNEY AS ITS HISTORIC NAMESAKE France suffered its first fatality on Sunday, a shepherd whose body was pulled from a river near the border.

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

When one enters through the gates, one will quickly notice a serene environment, lush bushes, and trees with birds perching here and there.The sanctuary hosts a large number of free grazing impalas, the rare Sitatunga antelope, Zebras, and the vervet monkeys.The caged animals include lions, leopards, buffalo, Ostrich, guinea fowls, and the baboons.This sanctuary is one of three in Kenya that was established to protect and rehabilitate wild animals as well as educate the public on wildlife conservation efforts. Others are the Nairobi Safari Walk and the Nairobi orphanage.Paul Omondi, the warden in charge of the Sanctuary says: "The reason why we have the orphanage and the safari walk and the impala sanctuary is that it is a refuge for the rescued wildlife, probably from human-wildlife conflict or problematic animals, the injured, and the orphaned. So the sanctuary is a way of offering them a home.âHere, unlike in the national parks, one will have a rare opportunity of seeing some of the animals up-close. The sanctuary is home to hundreds of impalas which boasts of the largest population followed by the Zebras.While taking a walk through the sanctuary, we observed herds of these herbivores which were busy grazing in the morning hours taking advantage of the cool breeze on the shores of the lake.Kisumu sun can be unforgiving, and it is based on this that Mr. Omondi encourages those who are interested in interacting with the animals as they feed, to always make it to the sanctuary in the morning before they retreat into the bushes away from the scorching sun."In terms of conservation fees for entry into the sanctuary, we charge adults Kenyans, Ksh. 200/$2 while children pay Ksh. 100/$1. For non-residents, we charge Ksh.2000/$20 and children Ksh.1500/$15." said Omondi.The low seasons for tourists both local and international are between January and April. The peak season runs between July and August while the high season remains to be September and December.However this year, the Sanctuary saw reduced numbers of visitors due to restrictions that were put in place by health authorities in an effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic spread.Lifespan in the cages vis a vis the wildLife in the wild is tough coupled with a rough terrain where only those who are swift survive.But as CGTN's Halligan Agade discovered, animals in this sanctuary seem to be enjoying life to the fullest because they are accessed to food and treatment unlike their counterparts in the wild.No wonder then Mr. Omondi submits that those in the wild have a shorter lifespan as compared to the caged ones, with the big cats for instance the lion likely to live up to 15 years even more in the cage."In the wild you know it is survival for the fittest but under captive management, the animals within the sanctuary tend to live longer because they are looked after, they are fed and treated."But there is another danger lurking in the shadows for these caged animals. Obesity. Just like humans, if caution is not taken, the Warden says, some animals especially the carnivores can be obese and this calls for the services of a veterinary expert to keep monitoring them since they do not run after their prey which is a form of exercise. This natural activity is only available in the wild."In terms of the feeding program, we're guided by our Veterinary team who come to inspect the animals on a monthly basis just to check the condition of the sanctuary, condition of the animals, the feeding regime, and the treatment regime."Controlled breedingBut it is not just obesity that is to be considered for the big cats, but the uncontrolled numbers of the herbivores like the Impalas must also be in check to control inbreeding to conserve a generation to make sure it does not face extinction arising from impure breeds."When we have a lot of animals like the impalas, we trans-locate them to Ndeere Island National Park. This is done in consultation with the species and research department in Nairobi. This is done to reduce the numbers and also give the excess numbers new habitat or new homes and also as a way of reducing inbreeding among the impalas that we have within the sanctuary."Interestingly, it is only the herbivores that can be translocated to the wild, however, for the carnivores, it doesn't happen."In captive management, in terms of the wild, it is a bit different for the lions that are under captive management. They are under cages, and they are fed. When you take them to the wild, they will have to fend for themselves and this is a habit they will have to learn. This poses a great danger to them in terms of survival and also existence." Omondi adds.But thanks to this sanctuary the endangered animals now have a place to call home.Free-ranging and captive animals are not the only attraction here, but bird-life, indigenous forest, swampy papyrus areas, grassland, rocky view area, nature trails, and sundowner viewpoint is also on the card for nature lovers.Set on the shore of Lake Victoria, the Kisumu Impala Sanctuary is just a ten minutes drive from the city center.

Other artifacts and at least 28 statues were found in the two deep wells, the ministry said.A sealed door was also unearthed where it is expected more mummies may lie behind, said Khaled el-Anany the first Minister of Antiquities and Tourism, adding that the artifacts were in an excellent state of preservation and would be displayed in the Grand Egyptian museum next year.Mostafa Waziri, the general director of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told NBC News that the discovery reminded him of the tomb of King Tutankhamun, because both had been discovered almost intact.The Saqqara plateau is part of the necropolis of Egypt's ancient city of Memphis. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1970s, it includes the famed Giza Pyramids. It is also home to tombs created across thousands of years between the 1st Dynasty (2920 B.C.-2770 B.C.) and the Coptic period (395-642).Hundreds of mummified animals, birds and crocodiles, as well as two mummified lion cubs were found in the region last year.Egypt has heavily promoted new archaeological finds to international media and diplomats in recent years, in an effort to revive its tourism sector, which has suffered since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak.The sector was dealt a further blow this year by the coronavirus pandemic.Last week, the ministry displayed a bronze statue of the god "Nefertam," one of the artifacts discovered with the ancient wooden coffins.Inlaid with precious stones red agate, turquoise and lapis lazuli, it reached a height of 35 cm (14 in) and on its base is inscribed with the name of the owner of the statue, a priest called "Badi Amun.""Saqqara antiquities area is still revealing its secrets," the ministry said.(With input from agencies)Archeologists in Egypt announced on Saturday that they had discovered at least 59 ancient coffins in a vast necropolis south of the country's capital Cairo, one containing the pristine mummy of an ancient priest. This is than 2,600 years since they were buried. The ornate sarcophagi have remained unopened since they were entombed near the famed Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara, according to Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.Footage shared by the ministry showed colorful sarcophagi decorated with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

Virtually all the damage has been done since mid-August, when five of the six largest fires in state history erupted. Lightning strikes caused some of the most devastating blazes.Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said wildfires have scorched 3.9 million acres in California since Aug. 15. That figure, which works out to over 6,000 square miles (15,500 square kilometers), is astonishing even in a state that has had its fair share of fires."It's likely that over the next day or two we will crest the 4-million-acre mark. The biggest year before this year was 1.54 million," Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said. "We are dwarfing that previous record and we have a lot of season left to go."Fire officials said the Glass Fire had first priority. Since erupting last Sunday, the fire has destroyed nearly 600 buildings, including 220 homes and nearly the same number of commercial structures.Some 80,000 people were under evacuation orders, which were expanded on Thursday.Four million acres have been burned this year by wildfires and leaving behind a trail of death of 30 people and incinerated hundreds of homes in what is already the worst fire season on record in California.The fires have torched an area larger than Connecticut and fire crews at a blaze in the northern wine country were on high alert as forecasters warned of red flag conditions of extreme fire danger into Saturday morning.Winds up to 30 mph (48 kph) were forecast to push through the hills in Napa and Sonoma counties as the Glass Fire, exploded in size earlier in the week, continued to threaten more than 28,000 homes and other buildings."It's a time of nervousness," said Paul Gullixon, a spokesman for Sonoma County.Winds were blowing at higher elevations on the western side of the fire and crews expected a long battle to keep flames from jumping containment lines and spot fires from leaping ahead to spark new blazes."It's going to be a big firefight for us over the next 36 hours," said Billy See, an assistant chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.More crews and equipment were deployed in and around Calistoga, a town of 5,000 people known for hot springs, mud baths and wineries in the hills of Napa County about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of San Francisco.The area was also experiencing high temperatures and thick smoke that fouled the air throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.Around the state, 17,000 firefighters were battling nearly two dozen major blazes. Virtually all the damage has been done since mid-August, when five of the six largest fires in state history erupted. Lightning strikes caused some of the most devastating blazes.Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said wildfires have scorched 3.9 million acres in California since Aug. 15. That figure, which works out to over 6,000 square miles (15,500 square kilometers), is astonishing even in a state that has had its fair share of fires."It's likely that over the next day or two we will crest the 4-million-acre mark. The biggest year before this year was 1.54 million," Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said.

said on Friday.Authorities declared a three-month state of emergency in early September after the worst flooding in 30 years.To date, more than 860,000 people have had houses destroyed or damaged and more than 120 people have died.Some 560 schools and thousands of health facilities have also been affected, compromising essential services to communities, especially in North Darfur, Khartoum, West Darfur, and Sennar, which account for 52 percent of all people affected.400,000 reached and countingThe response by UN agencies and partners has reached more than 400,000 people so far, including emergency shelter and essential household items relief to over 181,000 flood-affected refugees, 1.87 million internally displaced people, and Sudanese across the country.Meanwhile, COVID-19 virus transmission has continued, with 13,653 confirmed cases of the pandemic with 836 deaths, according to official data from the World Health Organization (WHO).Amid growing needs, surging inflation â reaching nearly 170 percent in August â has caused a shortage of basic commodities and increased prices of some locally sourced supplies by 300 to 400 percent."In some cases, by the time the procurement process is finalized, the supplies have increased prices, so that the original budgets are no longer valid," said OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke.He explained that this meant the purchasing process had to begin again and "there is no guarantee that by the time that that process is done, that the prices will not have risen once again".Healthcare costs have also increased by up to 90 percent, OCHA Sudan said in a recent tweet.In Geneva, Mr. Laerke noted that the price of an average family food basket had increased by over 200 percent since last year, based on World Food Programme (WFP) data, increasing pressure on already dramatic levels of food insecurity across Sudan, where 9.6 million people are described as "severely " in need.Cash shortfallsInflation has also affected the UN's humanitarian partners which provide cash support to vulnerable families, as they are constantly having to adjust the amounts transferred, Mr. Laerke said.Even with these adjustments, many families are no longer able to purchase what they need with the cash received.Today, only one in four families who previously relied on outside assistance now receives it, the OCHA spokesperson said.Crop failureAnother concern in Sudan is that large areas of farmland are underwater or ruined just before harvest."Most families in Sudan already spent around 65 percent of their income on food, so these price hikes lead to increased hunger and less education, health and other services that families de-prioritize as they try to cope with the economic hardship,"

caused unprecedented rainfall and flooding in others.Africa's largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria is one such example.Water levels in the lake are at unprecedented heights due to more than a year of heavy rains in the East African region.According to Eastern Africa Consortium for Clinical Research, the current rise in the lake began on 1st October 2019 and significantly went up from 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020. It was a 1.32 meters rise attained in only 6 months before hitting an all-time high of 13.42-meter mark by September this year.However, heavy rain isn't the only thing fueling Lake Victoria's rising levels. Environmental degradation, urbanization, and other human activity all play a part.Dr. Raymond Omollo the Director at Lake Basin Development Authority says that development is good for humanity, but it can also change the ecosystem."On the Ugandan side, there has been a huge hydro-project, so again that limits the amount of water that is flowing out of the lake at any given time. With this, you have the backflow so then you do not release as much water as you would ordinarily," Dr. Omollo says.The Kenyan government is also constructing dams to help manage the flow of water to the lake. Authorities have embarked on afforestation programs to help water catchment areas to reduce soil erosion.Human activities along the shores of the lake have also impacted the massive lake especially deforestation and agricultural activities.Officials say that there must be a concerted effort to target these activities and make sure that they are controlled to save the lake."In order for us to manage this easily, firstly we must target the areas where people do agriculture because that's where land has been opened up. Cultivation has been done and any little rain will wash away the topsoil, get it into the river, and from there, it will go settling," Ken K'oyoo the Director of the Environment in Kisumu County explains.People close to the lake are being advised to relocate to other areas. Officials worry the lake might continue to swell and displace more people who have lived along its shores for over a half a century now."When you drive along the lake, there are huge investments whether in the hospitality industry and when the water levels rise, a number of facilities in Kisumu were not usable, because they were partly submerged," Dr. Omollo adds.Climate change has become one of the main agendas of the United Nations Environment-UNEP with the clarion call that global citizens must unite to reduce its impact. The changing weather patterns have without a doubt resulted in many natural disasters across the world and loss of lives."It is a pointer to the fact that climate change is real and unless we are able to make our voices heard and do something about its impact, then very soon we would probably lose a lot of livelihoods and the beautiful lake, the resource that we have might end up being a curse rather than a blessing," Dr. Omollo says.Climate change has not only led to drought, wildfires, and ice melting in some parts of the globe, but it has also caused unprecedented rainfall and flooding in others.Africa's largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria is one such example.Water levels in the lake are at unprecedented heights due to more than a year of heavy rains in the East African region.According to Eastern Africa Consortium for Clinical Research, the current rise in the lake began on 1st October 2019 and significantly went up from 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020.

These measures, such as expediting legislation to protect biodiversity, drawing red lines for ecological protection, establishing a national park system, undertaking major projects for biodiversity protection, and coordinating and advancing biodiversity management will help the country to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and to ensure China's greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2030. He also called for multilateralism in protecting biodiversity.French President Emmanuel Macron stressed the need to step up the fight against environmental crime, and to put a definitive end to all illegal activities that endanger nature, destroy ecosystems, feed corruption, hinder the development of the rule of law and, ultimately undermine the sustainable development of humanity. He also called for the transformation of the current models of production, trade and consumption, as well as public investment to enable the transformation. He also said France will mobilize for the adoption of an ambitious new global strategic framework for the protection of biodiversity at next year's UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is striving to be a leader in protecting the environment, and surpassed its target of protecting 10 percent of marine areas by 2020. He pledged to protect 30 percent of land and oceans by 2030.While many countries have joined the UN in pledging to protect 30 percent of their land and seas by 2030, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro strongly opposed "international greed" towards the Amazon rainforest, and said that countries have the right to use their natural resources and "that is precisely what we intend to do with the huge wealth of resources found in the Brazilian territory."Our planet is facing severe threats from biodiversity loss and requires urgent attention and efforts to reverse the damage. Recent assessments by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) concluded that species extinction rates are tens to hundreds of times higher now than historical averages.Seventy-five percent of the Earth's land surface has been significantly altered by human actions, including the loss of 85 percent of wetlands area, and 66 percent of the ocean is experiencing multiple impacts from people, including from fisheries, pollution, and chemical changes from acidification.(With input from Xinhua and statistics from UN official website.

As well as providing a habitat for many marine species, it also captures carbon 35 times faster than a rainforest. But in recent years, fields of the plant have shrunk as a result of pollution, an influx in fishing and a rise in coastal development.  CLICK: FOR MORE STORIES FROM RAZOR, CGTN'S BRAND NEW SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWThe group of marine biologists from Swansea University, backed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Sky Ocean Rescue, has embarked on a $515,000 project named Project Seagrasses to restore the meadows to their previous state. RAZOR's Jo Colan joined the team of scientists in Dale Fort, Wales as they began the first ever seagrass restoration replanting in the UK. Richard Unsworth, one of the marine biologists in the team said: "Seagrasses have been decimated around the UK. We think that the UK has lost at least 90 percent of its seagrass. So it remains a scattered, fragmented habitat that used to be a very dominant part of the coast of the UK."Over the summer, the team collected more than 750,000 seeds from across the UK and then transported them back to the University's labs.The seeds were then washed and artificially vernalised (kept at a near-freezing temperature to mimic the winter season.) After that, the temperature was increased, allowing them to germinate, before they were put in bags and dropped into the sea.  They used the help of children from a local primary school to help fill the bags with seeds, with the hope it will help the next generation get a better understanding of the importance of the process."We came up with the idea of using a pretty simplistic little bag, the sort of hessian bag that your Christmas soap gets packed in and gets a little bow on it. Making sure they are nicely topped up with sand," Unsworth added, saying there are about 50 seeds in each bag.In around six months, the first seagrass shoots from the project are expected to emerge on the seabed."Well, we face a growing climate emergency and we have to make important rapid steps as a planet to fight that emergency. Seagrasses store vast amounts of carbon in their sediments. And they do that very, very rapidly so it can stay and remain locked away for millennia. We also face a biodiversity emergency, where all populations of all major animals and plants on this planet are in decline," Unsworth explained.Video editing: Natalia LuzA team of UK scientists has launched an "emergency" seagrass restoration project to try to revive the country's underwater meadows. World leaders are set to meet on Wednesday at a United Nations summit to discuss the "urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development" as it continues to be a growing global issue. Seagrass is the only flowering plant in the world that can pollinate underwater. As well as providing a habitat for many marine species, it also captures carbon 35 times faster than a rainforest. But in recent years, fields of the plant have shrunk as a result of pollution, an influx in fishing and a rise in coastal development.  CLICK: FOR MORE STORIES FROM RAZOR, CGTN'S BRAND NEW SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWThe group of marine biologists from Swansea University, backed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Sky Ocean Rescue, has embarked on a $515,000 project named Project Seagrasses to restore the meadows to their previous state. RAZOR's Jo Colan joined the team of scientists in Dale Fort, Wales as they began the first ever seagrass restoration replanting in the UK. Richard Unsworth, one of the marine biologists in the team said: "Seagrasses have been decimated around the UK. We think that the UK has lost at least 90 percent of its seagrass. So it remains a scattered, fragmented habitat that used to be a very dominant part of the coast of the UK."Over the summer, the team collected more than 750,000 seeds from across the UK and then transported them back to the University's labs.The seeds were then washed and artificially vernalised (kept at a near-freezing temperature to mimic the winter season.) After that, the temperature was increased, allowing them to germinate, before they were put in bags and dropped into the sea.  They used the help of children from a local primary school to help fill the bags with seeds, with the hope it will help the next generation get a better understanding of the importance of the process."We came up with the idea of using a pretty simplistic little bag, the sort of hessian bag that your Christmas soap gets packed in and gets a little bow on it. Making sure they are nicely topped up with sand," Unsworth added, saying there are about 50 seeds in each bag.In around six months, the first seagrass shoots from the project are expected to emerge on the seabed."Well, we face a growing climate emergency and we have to make important rapid steps as a planet to fight that emergency. Seagrasses store vast amounts of carbon in their sediments. And they do that very, very rapidly so it can stay and remain locked away for millennia. We also face a biodiversity emergency, where all populations of all major animals and plants on this planet are in decline," Unsworth explained.Video editing: Natalia LuzSitting in northeast China's Liaoning Province, Shenyang's bird island is a natural bird observance center.

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report last year found nearly 1 million species are on the verge of extinction.The Living Planet Report prepared by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Zoological Society of London calculated global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish decline by an average two-third in less than half a century.In order to protect the global biodiversity, world leaders committed to 20 targets in 2010 during a meeting at Aichi in Japan. None of the 20 targets agreed on by the governments were able to be met, found a review of the 'Aichi Targets" released early this month. The summit will be an opportunity to demonstrate ambition to accelerate action on controlling and reversing the biodiversity loss, said the CBD. The commitments made at New York would undergo revision and leaders would decide a new biodiversity framework during the Conference of Parties (COP15), UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China next year."We call on all leaders to build on this ambition at the forthcoming UN Summit on Biodiversity," said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF-International."Together, they must develop and agree on a shared plan for the biodiversity and climate negotiations scheduled for next year, to secure a carbon-neutral, nature-positive and equitable future for all. There has never been a more crucial time to act for nature than now," he added.(A farmer in South Africa harvesting rooibos, which is commonly used for making herbal tea. /Natural Justice.)Political leaders from 64 countries have pledged to protect the environment and reverse massive loss of species ahead of the United Nations Summit on Biodiversity, which is scheduled to be held in New York on Wednesday.They committed to work towards a range of issues, including climate change, marine ecosystem protection, sustainable land use, restoring migration routes and many other areas to prevent the alarming scale of biodiversity loss in the world."This pledge is a recognition of this crisis and an expression of the need for a profound re-commitment from world leaders to take urgent action," stated the signed document."Against the backdrop of COVID-19, which has crippled the world's economies and pressured governments everywhere to begin the process of rebuilding and renewing, decisions made now will have ramifications for all of us and for generations to come."With the world facing the coronavirus pandemic and failing to meet the 2020 biodiversity targets agreed in 2010, the summit would be an opportunity for world leaders to revise their goals and commitment to protect nature."The connections between human well-being and the health of our ecosystems are extensive," said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at the round table "Biodiversity Beyond 2020: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth.""The challenges of climate change and COVID-19 show us the importance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use to ensure a more secure, inclusive and resilient world," she added.    Many experts have established strong links between biodiversity loss and viral outbreaks, seeking a concentrated global effort for sustainable development.A series of studies have also exposed the alarming loss of wild animals and plants because of human activities.

"The reasons for this are unclear," they said. "Lots of factors could affect the changing of numbers of sea turtles sighted," said Zara Botterell of the University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. "Climate change, prey availability and environmental disasters such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill could all influence turtle numbers and behavior."The record shows a dramatic increase in the turtle sightings in the 1980s and 1990s, which researchers attribute to the rising public interest in conservation activities and a better reporting mechanism. Of the seven different sea turtle species, six of them â green, hawksbill, kemp's ridley, leatherback, loggerhead, and the olive ridley â are found in both warm and cold water oceans in many countries. But the flatback turtles reside only in Australia, Indonesia and Southern Papua New Guinea.In the UK and Ireland, leatherback sea turtles are regularly spotted, making up 1,683 of the 1,997 sightings since 1910. These turtles visit the country's ocean during the summer months to feast on jellyfish. The record shows spotting of 240 loggerheads, 61 Kemp's ridley turtles during winter months. These turtles might have been carried on currents and are stranded in cold waters. But only 11 green turtles, one hawksbill and one olive ridley sightings were found in the record. Most of the recorded sightings of turtles in the UK and Ireland were along western and southern coasts. Of the 1,997 turtles sighted, 143 were "bycatch" (caught accidentally) in fishing lines, nets and ropes â and the large majority of these were released alive.But researchers claim that the sea turtle populations in the North Atlantic are mostly stable or increasing. "The apparent decrease may represent reduced reporting rather than fewer turtles in our seas," said Botterell."One reason for this could be that fewer fishing boats are at sea now than in the past â and fishers are the most likely people to see and report turtles," she added. Concerned over the depleting population of sea turtles, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has already declared kemp's ridley, hawksbil and green sea turtles critically endangered, seeking the intervention of the governments.Leatherback, olive ridley, green and loggerhead turtles have been placed under the endangered list. There is not enough data available about flatback turtles.  "We have been lucky to analyze this unique dataset that exists because Britain and Ireland are a real hotbed of engaged citizen science, said Professor Brendan Godley, who leads the Exeter Marine research group. "Members of the public report their sightings in schemes supported by conservation charities and government bodies."(Cover: Researchers measuring a leatherback sea turtle in the UK. /Jane Newman)Red-billed leiothrix has been regarded as the bird of love since ancient times as they repeatedly appeared in literature, symbolizing the solid romantic relationship built on loyalty. (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Swans stopped at Bosten Lake in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on their migration journey south.The seasonal journey, driven by the need to breed in the spring and forage in the winter, is shared by many migratory birds across the world.(All images photoed by Nian Lei)(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Marine conservationists have expressed concern over the declining number of endangered sea turtle sightings along the coasts of the UK and Ireland. A study of the record, dating back to more than a century from 1910-2018 by the University of Exeter scientists, shows that the turtle's sightings have dropped since 2000.

Up till the end of last year, eight out of nine projected goals had been accomplished in terms of concentration of fine particles, carbon emissions, water quality and the elimination of other chemical pollutants, Zhao Yingmin, vice minister of ecology and environment, said.Zhao told a press conference on October 21 that the number of days with excellent or good air quality in 2020 is expected to reach 84.5% by the end of the year, comfortably meeting the goal as outlined in the plan.On top of that, China has also contributed significantly to tackling climate change by controlling carbon emissions, promoting energy conservation, boosting the development of green energy and actively participating in international governance. Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP continues to decline and carbon intensity has decreased by 18.2% compared to 2015. Since 2010, sales of new energy cars have taken up 55 percent of the global figure, making China the country with the largest number of new energy vehicles in the world.Zhao said the achievement is the result of a continuously improved management system in the construction of ecological civilization and stronger laws and regulation. Having said that, challenges still remain. "Our industrial structure still relies heavily on the chemical industry, the energy industry still mainly relies on coal, and transportation is still highway-based," Zhao said. "Meanwhile, the world is undergoing profound and complex changes, the risks and challenges are growing every day, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. China's environmental protection is still an arduous task and the road ahead is long and tortuous.""We will continue our efforts in environmental protection and fighting against climate change based on the previous experiences in the next five years." (All photos via VCG. )(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)China experienced its greatest improvement in ecological and environmental protection from 2016 to 2020 after the completion of the main objectives and tasks outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.This year is the last year of the plan in which more attention has been given to environmental protection â targets for cutting carbon emissions and optimizing energy use.

The iconic marsupials, with some of the strongest jaws on the planet, were recently released into a sprawling, biodiversity-rich reserve in New South Wales."They are on their own. There's no food, no shelter, monitoring takes place four times a year through a tracking system and process, but the devils are out there," said Aussie Ark president Tim Faulkner.It's not known what led to the end of the devils' existence on the mainland."It may have been a mix of Aboriginal hunting, a mix of people bringing dingoes from Southeast Asia into Australia, it also might have been a couple of climate snaps that reduced prey availability for devils and potentially even disease," said Rewilding Australia director Rob Brewster.The devils continued to thrive in Tasmania until the 1990's when a facial tumor disease wiped out about 90 percent of the wild population.That prompted conservation efforts to increase disease-free numbers.It also eventually led to a plan involving species recovery specialists Aussie Ark to bring healthy Tasmanian devils to a unique, fenced wildlife sanctuary in Barrington Tops. "It is the most northerly part of Antarctic beach forest and sub-alpine Montagne swamps in Australia. It is the most southerly distribution of subtropical rainforests," said Faulkner. "It got an elevation change from sea level to 1,400 meters above sea level and so it is a mixing pot and a melting pot of biodiversity. It is home to 15 percent of all vertebrate fauna in Australia.â Australia has lost more mammals to extinction than any other country in the world, which experts say is largely due to introduced predators such as foxes and feral cats. They are counting on the devils to play a vital role in protecting other endangered species. "The devil has a role and impact on feral pests and it maintains balance within an ecosystem. So to bring them back to the mainland, they present no threat to humans, they present no threat to livestock. It is very unique in terms of a top order predator, but what they do critically in the absence of any other solution is control and disrupt numbers and populations of the feral fox and the feral cat, which are almost singularly related to almost all of our mammal extinctions," said Faulkner.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)After a 3,000-year absence, Tasmanian devils have made a return to Australia's mainland.

Thanks years of painstaking efforts, however, Qingyang has gradually brought the loss under control, Xinhua News Agency reported.The local water resources authority devised terraced fields and planted trees such as pines and sea buckthorn on slopes. At the bottom of the slopes, dams have been built to stop muddy water from flowing into the river.Data from the local soil and water conservation bureau showed the city lost about 98 million metric tonnes of soil last year, down by more than 40 percent from the average annual loss in the 1980s."Nevertheless, to maintain the declining trend nationwide, further efforts are needed, especially in areas severely hit by soil erosion such as Northeast and Southwest China and the Yangtze and Yellow river basins," the Ministry said. "Also, it is possible for areas that have been treated to revert into regions affected by soil erosion if results are not well maintained."A one-year campaign launched by the ministry last month targets illegal projects and activities that cause soil erosion in 71 cities and more than 450 counties in the Yellow River Basin. It will be followed by strict supervision measures."Theoretically, soil resources are renewable, but they will be drained under intense influence from human activities," stated the Ministry.Research by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geochemistry in 2006 found that it takes up to 3,000 years to form 1 centimeter of soil in parts of China with karst landforms, but that can be lost in just a few heavy rainstorms if not protected well.With nearly 30 percent of China's land currently affected by soil erosion, the ministry said there is an urgent need to minimize the depletion of soil because it causes harm to diversity and the economy, along with geological disasters and infrastructural damage.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said last year that soil erosion may reduce global crop yields by up to 10 percent by 2050 â the equivalent of removing millions of hectares of land from crop production.The Ministry said it will step up efforts to slow down soil erosion and prevent environmental damage caused by development activities.(Original editor: Li Hongyang)(All images via CFP)(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Further reduction of soil erosion in China is becoming increasingly difficult as the remaining affected areas â which have seen four decades of progress that have reduced the extent of the problem and its intensity â are "tougher and more complicated" to deal with, the Ministry of Water Resources has said.The latest data, released by the Ministry in August, said 2.71 million square kilometers of land experienced soil erosion last year, down by almost 1 percent from 2018 and 26 percent from the 1980s.The improvement was due to various water conservancy projects, including transforming slope farmland that is more likely to lose soil when it rains into a combination of terraced farmland, forests and grassland.For example, the Loess Plateau, located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, remains one of the most severely eroded areas in China due to its hilly terrain and heavy summer rains.In the 1980s, about 10 percent of the soil that entered the Yellow River each year came from Qingyang, a city on the plateau in Gansu Province.

And then potentially the chemistry of the river is damaged as well."Prior to the arrival of sewage, the Chess's riverbed was lined with minerals to create perfect conditions for fish and wildlife to thrive. It remains popular with fishermen and dog walkers and is a haven for brown trout, the endangered water vole and many other species â but everything that depends on it is under threat from pollution.  The sewage discharge is one key reason the River Chess failed chemical pollution tests, according to a recent UK government report by the Environment Agency. But data gathered from lakes, rivers and streams all across England over three years up paint a grim picture nationwide. Only 14 percent of rivers were found to have a "good ecological status" and none proved to be entirely pollution free. The report says population growth, land use and climate change are all contributing to the problem. "Obviously there is a widespread and endemic problem with pollution in our rivers," says Mark Lloyd, CEO of the Rivers Trust, an umbrella organization that works to protect UK rivers. "And really that's from two sources, principally â from sewage pollution and from agriculture. There's also a problem with urban pollution and run-off from roads. We have solved some of those gross pollution issues from the past, but we have new threats, we have new emerging chemicals, things like flame retardants and PCBs and things that are very persistent in the environment."Water companies were also criticized in a separate recent government report by the Environment Agency.

"Our system seems to routinely cause those overflows, because the system is so overloaded with the proliferation of hard surfaces and also population growth," says Lloyd."We're really asking our sewers to do a job they weren't designed for. And so, we need to design sewers fit for the future, including climate change. It's been designed around a system that is hundreds of years old. It combines surface water with foul sewage. That really does need to be completely reverse engineered."Thames Water, which operates the sewage storm tanks in Ewell and the water treatment works along the River Chess, says that in some cases sewage discharge is unavoidable."We work hard to minimize storm discharges, while also looking at how we can improve the system for the future, including reducing groundwater infiltration and increasing capacity," the company said in a statement. "We've also invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills occur and help us plan improvements."  Along the River Chess, regular monitoring of pollution is done by volunteers, with the help of equipment loaned by Queen Mary University of London. Jennings believes the government should be helping more. "They're not looking at this as they should do and they're not protecting our rivers, as we believe they should do," he says. "So, we have to intervene and push the Environment Agency, push government, push the water companies to take action."The government says it is trying to tackle the problem. A spokesperson for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The latest water classification results show we need to go further and faster to protect our water environment, in particular chalk streams like the River Chess. That's why we have set up a task force to set out clear proposals to reduce the frequency and volumes of sewage discharged by storm overflows."Whatever the solutions, they are likely to take time to implement and for real improvement to show.

"So, this isn't exactly something new, but it has escalated and become a lot more severe because of the pandemic and so what we are seeing is there has been a bit of backlash in terms of creating more negative attitudes towards bats."Following the outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998, which was transmitted from fruit bats to pigs and then to humans, most research in the country has focused on the flying fox and other bats' role as possible vectors of disease."I knew from research done in other countries that they actually played as very major and important role in maintaining the health of our tropical ecosystems," said Dr. Sheema, co-founder of Rimba, a non-profit group of scientists."At the same time, I found out that the flying foxes are disappearing very rapidly because of human activities, such as hunting and clearing forests and mangroves."They are not just hunted for food and medicine. Fruit farmers often kill them too."It just seemed like this was a very important issue that was being overlooked and ignored," Sheema said.Rimba's Project Pteropus â pteropus being the Latin name for the flying fox â aims to fill that knowledge gap.Hauling himself up a towering durian tree with rope pulley, a man sets up a camera to capture night time images of the bats' activities.Farmers of the much-prized durian fruit had long believed that the bats knocked the durian flowers off the tree, reducing their yields. In fact, the opposite is true."They're  playing this very important role in durian farms where they're helping to actually pollinate the durian flowers," Sheema said."Malaysia flying foxes play this unique dual role in a number of ecosystems, such as rainforests, mangroves, peat swamps, freshwater swamps. They're both seed dispersers and also pollinators. So, when they carry fruits away, they're actually helping to carry seeds away and helping to plant these seeds in other parts of the landscape, but then they're also visiting flowers to drink nectar as well, collecting pollen and then transferring the pollen somewhere else."Still, their furry canine-like faces have done little to endear them to fruit farmers."Fruit farmers have complained about flying foxes feeding on the fruit crops in the past, and they believe this necessitates eradicating the flying foxes."Project Pteropus has set out to research the role the flying fox bats play in the ecosystem to counter the negative perceptions â and the unnecessary killing. Rimba has produced posters and animated videos to reach out to the public and gone to the ground to educate farmers.Eric Chong runs an ecolodge and fruit orchard on the northern island of Penang."At my neighbor's farm, they are actually putting up nets to trap the bats, especially around their fruit trees," he said."When we first got the farm, our caretaker had advised us to leave the bats alone, they actually will help the farm, so we left the bats alone, not having much proof of actually what bats do."Then Rimba showed him the night camera video of the bats interacting with the durian flowers."When I saw that video of the bats pollinating the durian flowers, yeah, I was very convinced of their beneficial impact," Chong said.He believes other farmers would be too.But Rimba knows there's more than just misperception at work here. Flying foxes aren't dubbed fruit bats for no reason."We need to start investigating and trialling mitigation methods in partnership with the farmers so that we can look into ways that we can help protect the fruit crops from the bats without actually killing the bats," Sheema said.Rimba is also reaching out to educate the broader public too."Anyone who might be hunting or killing flying foxes, they actually need to stop this kind of practice because if the flying fox disappears from the ecosystem, if they disappear from Malaysia, they could be very negative impacts on all of us on our well-being, on the economy, on industries."As for fears about bats as spreaders of deadly disease, "All they need to do to avoid infection risk from bats is really to just leave bats alone, not to consume them, not to disturb them, not to kill them."(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)From a public relations standpoint, it's not a good time to be a bat â much less a member of the flying fox fruit bat species linked to the spread of COVID-19."Bats have always had this negative reputation in general," said Malaysian researcher Sheema Abdul Aziz.

In the past, they attached great importance to weaving, because the whole family's wear for a year must be made during this period.Today, although they don't need to catch up on time to make hemp fabric and clothes, the traditional weaving skills deserve to be protected.In Gongshan Dulong and Nu Autonomous County, southwest China's Yunnan Province, a girl of Nu ethnic minority learns traditional weaving skills from her mother.She tied one end of the threads to her body and the other end to a wooden pile, and used a shuttle to guide the weft thread across threads before pushing up the weft against the fell of the cloth to make it dense.About 'Go!

The world is curious about how China will achieve this ambitious goal. Alok Gupta spoke to Professor Li Zheng and He Jiankun from the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University about how China plans to reduce emissions to zero. Below are excerpts from the interview edited for clarity. What are the major challenges for China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060?China's carbon dioxide emissions would reach its peak by 2030, which means we have 30 years to meet the carbon neutrality deadline. But developed countries have 50-70 years, so our future emissions reduction process will be very urgent.The share of manufacturing in China's economy is much higher than those in developed countries, resulting in a relatively high per capita consumption of energy. Manufacturing consumes a large amount of power, which is, mainly produced by burning fossil fuels â coal, oil and gas â resulting in emissions. We are already shifting to green energy like solar and wind. There is a need to develop a digital economy, high-tech industries, and restructure industries to curb fossil fuels, boost low-carbon energy, and develop new and renewable energy sectors to bring down emission levels.Is there a timeline for reduction in the use of fossil fuels, especially coal? The share of coal in primary energy consumption has declined to nearly 57 percent, and non-fossil energy has exceeded 15 percent. Thus, by 2050, non-fossil energy may account for more than 90 percent of the total power generation. Only in this way can we make it possible to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060; under such a scenario, national five-year-plans become crucial. Thus, the 14th five-year plan could be vital to knowing the path our policymakers are paving to meet carbon neutrality and ensure economic growth.Which key sectors would have to reduce their emissions drastically?The power industry is the largest carbon emitter, accounting for about 40 percent of the nation's total emissions. Among the energy-intensive sectors, including iron and steel, cement, and building materials, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, and manufacturing, are directly or indirectly responsible for about 45 percent of the total national emissions. In addition to reducing final demand through a circular economy, these industries will have to adopt smart technologies and cleaner fuel to reduce their carbon footprint. We think that the power industry should take the lead and become the first one to decarbonize. How will the coronavirus pandemic impact China's plan to become carbon neutral?There is a Chinese proverbäººæ è¿è, å¿æè¿å¿§, which means, those who do not plan for the future will soon find trouble at their doorstep.Carbon neutrality is a long-term plan that will eventually help in preventing pandemics in the future. Moreover, biodiversity loss because of climate change could be strongly linked to viral outbreaks. The world will tide over the COVID-19 but preventing global temperature rise beyond 1.5-2 degrees Celsius would have many benefits, including reducing extreme weather events like wildfires, typhoons and floods. The current pandemic helps us to prepare for the commitments made during the Paris Climate Change Agreement.Apart from controlling industrial emissions, what else should be done to meet carbon neutrality?  We will also have to strengthen forestry, land use, and agriculture, which absorb carbon dioxide and boost biodiversity. At present, China has the world's largest planted forest and along with agriculture, wetlands, grasslands, and effective land use, it helps absorb about 800 million tons of carbon dioxide. This sector can help create green jobs and bring people closer to nature. What will be the impact of China's decision to go carbon neutral on the annual Climate Change Summit in Glasgow next year? We believe that President Xi Jinping's announcement would motivate other countries to strengthen their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce their emissions and boost the morale of the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. China is taking a responsible role in international and global governance and leading global efforts to fulfill the Paris Climate Agreement, sustainable development and economic recovery.He Jiankun is vice director, National Expert Committee on Climate Change and Academic Chair of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development, Tsinghua UniversityLi Zheng, is executive vice president of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development and Director of the Laboratory of Low Carbon Energy, Tsinghua UniversityVideo Editors: Oscar Margain, Gong Zhe(Cover: The City skyline is seen amid smog ahead of Chinese Lunar New Year in Beijing, China February 13, 2018. /Reuters)In a surprise announcement, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would become a carbon-neutral country by 2060 during his virtual address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) last month.

Enthusiasts around the world have praised the fermented tea for some of its possible health benefits. CGTN's Nick Mudimba visited a kombucha maker based on the outskirts of Nairobi and brings us this report.It's said you are what you eat. Many Kenyans have been turning to healthier diets and working out to stay in shape. Away from the world of sugary sodas and chemical preservatives, Andrew Wachira is making and selling an alternative beverage.Andrew Wachira, Founder, Kombucha Kenya says: "Kombucha is tea that is fermented and is fermented by good bacteria, we also call them probiotics, and good bacteria will act on the sweetened tea and for seven days or so it will turn out into this drink we call Kombucha."The drink is said to also contain antioxidants which can kill harmful bacteria and boost the immune system.The ingredients Wachira uses to make kombucha include tea bags, sugar, culture or SCOBY an acronym that means Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast, a starter liquid of a small amount of kombucha that has been brewed from a previous batch.He adds, "Steep the tea bags into hot water, steep it for a couple of minutes and thereafter you can add sugar, you can even add sugar while the tea is hot, the sugar can be more soluble in the tea and afterwards you now have to put it into the container that you are going to brew it â¦ Once you put the sweetened tea into the fermentation bucket or the container all you need to do is to add more water so that it can take the temperature down to room temperature, after that we now add the starter liquid and the scoby, the starter liquid comes first you give it a good stir and thereafter you add the scoby and you place it on top of that brew and you cover it."The tea which comes in many flavours is left to ferment for two or three weeks. Many of Wachira's clients come to him directly to pick up their supply.With nutritionists warning of the health risks associated with sweetened fizzy drinks like sodas, demand is moving towards healthier beverages like Kombucha - and Wachira says it's the health benefits that keep his clients coming back for more. Kombucha has been gaining popularity in Kenya.

Skin whitening and the issue of colorism has been linked to a complex history of colonialism and slavery. And as CGTN's Patrick Oyet reports buying of skin lightening creams continues despite government ban.Each individual bleaching here has their own reasons for doing so."Skin whitening is good, I like it because it makes me look like a white lady, but I don't want to overdo it, I just want to maintain how I look now, my advice to those whitening their skin is that don't apply the much at one, whitening is a process that takes time," Joyce Keji Emmanuel, Juba Resident says.Before independence in 2011, more light-skinned Arab Sudanese ruled a then-united Sudan out of Khartoum.The main goal of successive regimes in Khartoum was to Islamize and Arabize Sudan. The blacks from the Southern Part of the country were religiously and politically marginalized and suffered discrimination due to their skin colour.Many women and girls opted to whiten their skin to look more like the Arab population.Bleaching is not limited to women and girls, some men in South Sudan are also whitening their skin.But some people resist the idea of whitening their skin.Susan Kim Otor, Coordinator, defy-hate-now submits: "I believe in my creator, and he did not make a mistake when he created me black, and I believe I am beautiful in my natural color. So, why destroy it with such unnatural things."However, medical experts are warning of the dangers of skin whitening."Some patients also develop deposition of these toxic agents into some organs like the liver because by the way you apply it on the skin, it's absorbed in the blood, taken by the blood circulation system and deposited into various organs, that's the worst part that many people are experiencing," Dr. Francis Oromo, a medic argues.The government says it has halted the sale and use of the cosmetics for whitening skin across the country.Peter Baak, Director General, Drug and Food Control Authority, South Sudan says, "We have banned the use of body whitening creams, the policy is clear and we will continue to make sure that our market in South Sudan is free from unwanted cosmetics to ensure that our people are not harmed."However, most of Juba's markets have several stores, where people can buy bleaching agents.And people like Joyce Keji continue to access them and whiten their skin. Skin bleaching is a popular practice with many South Sudanese - especially among but not limited to, women and girls.

Job losses, illness, financial difficulties, and even some people's fear of contracting the virus from pets, led to a rise in animal abandonments in the UK. When people were furloughed or working from home, the adoption rate went up. During the first week of lockdown Battersea Dogs and Cats Home reported 86 dogs and 69 cats were rehomed, rising from 42 and 29 respectively in the same period last year.While this might look like a positive trend, and these animals went to good homes, it is too early to say that lockdown united all abandoned animals across the UK with new owners for the long term. When people go back to work their priorities change and newly-adopted pets can be at risk of ending up in a shelter because of the lack of time and commitment from their owners. Compared with the same period last year, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) charity received four times more calls from prospective owners when the UK went into lockdown â but now the organization has been receiving calls from those who want to return their new pets.  "People have gone back to work and then suddenly realized that this puppy doesn't fit into their life any more," says Herchran Boal, an RSPCA inspector in the West Midlands. "It's almost as if they didn't think about that. And that's very sad because a pet is for life, it's not just for the lockdown period."During the first three months of the lockdown the RSPCA received almost 3,500 calls â 40 a day â about abandoned animals, including 1,509 dogs, 1,165 cats, 299 small animals such as hamsters and guinea pigs and 275 exotic animals. The closure of RSPCA centers, shortage of staff and a surge of abandoned animals put the charity in a very difficult position. "I've been an inspector for 20 years and this is the worst that anything has affected the RSPCA," says Boal. "We have a service that was being provided for 24 hours a day but due to the pandemic we've had to close our control centers overnight. We have always been an organization that's gone on 24/7 because animals don't get sick just nine to five. People need us all the time."As a charity, the RSPCA relies on public donations â but fundraising events had to be stopped and the donations from the public have slowed down due to the COVID-19 crisis. "The NHS have done an amazing job and they're really great," says Boal. "But let's not forget the animals. The animals are what keep some people going, really.

They have eliminated agricultural export subsidies, enhanced market access for cotton and cotton by-product exports from LDCs and worked to enable developing countries to benefit more from every step of the cotton value chain. Nevertheless, it is widely believed that more can be done to level the playing field for cotton producers, especially in LDCs.The annual World Cotton Day celebrations are an opportunity to recognize the importance of this global commodity â and to push forward with positive economic, development and sustainable trade policies.For the 2020 edition, the WTO has established a dedicated webpage that brings together contributions from ministers, ambassadors, heads of organizations and the private sector on the importance of cotton and the relevance of World Cotton Day to their respective countries and organizations.  The WTO has also set up a stand in its headquarters to celebrate cotton, with the distribution of souvenirs and information on cotton to staff and delegates.The importance of cotton to Cotton-4 countriesCotton production is the source of livelihood to over 4 million farmers in Africa, of which around 1 million are located in the Cotton-4 countries.For the Cotton-4 countries, cotton earnings represent between 8 to 12% of their annual Gross Domestic Production (GDP) and account for up to 40% of their total export revenue.Current world cotton production is above 26 million tonnes from which more than 8 million tonnes are traded globally every year.The Cotton-4 countries export approximately 800,000 tonnes of cotton per year, totalling around 10% of the total world cotton exports.(With input from World Trade Organization)The spotlight was shone on the importance of cotton for millions of farmers, processors and traders globally as the  World Trade Organization marked the first anniversary of World Cotton Day.The Cotton-4 group (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali) initiated the cotton sectoral initiative at the WTO with the aim of improving the global trade rules as they relate to cotton, and to shed light on the many linkages among trade, cotton and development.World Cotton Day aims to highlight the numerous gains enabled by international trade in cotton, including: selling to consumers abroad; increasing foreign exchange earnings; attracting investment in local businesses; employing more workers; and fostering growth and technology transfer in the wider economy.While widely appreciated as a fibre used to make textiles and clothes, cotton is also used in the production of edible oils, animal feed and fuel. Cotton production, processing, and trade represent a key source of income for a number of economies worldwide.In many African least developed countries (LDCs), cotton is key to job creation and economic stability.At the WTO, members have taken meaningful steps to promote cotton trade.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

Much of the continent saw above average temperatures for September, especially southeastern Europe.Western Europe also experienced bursts of record-breaking heatwaves last month, with temperatures reaching unusually high levels.The northern French city of Lille in mid-September had its hottest September day since records began in 1945, while cities in Germany and the UK experienced the highest September temperatures in four years.In Russia, according to the state weather service, last month was the country's hottest September in the 130 years since records began.  The Russian Hydrometeorology Center said almost every part of the country had experienced temperatures that were several degrees above average, with the largest anomalies of temperatures exceeding the average by five to six degrees Celsius observed in north Eurasia near the Arctic Circle.C3S scientists also found that in the Siberian Arctic, temperatures continued to be warmer than average in September, continuing a heatwave that affected different parts of the vast region since early spring."Although Siberia and the Arctic have large temperature fluctuations from year to year, the relative warmth observed this year has been unusual in its magnitude and persistence," Copernicus said in a statement. Melting Arctic sea iceAlongside the increasing temperatures in the Arctic, C3S also confirmed that sea ice levels have been melting and are in decline. The figures show that the average Arctic sea ice extent for September was the second lowest recorded, after September 2012.  Sea ice extent in the Arctic has declined noticeably since 1979 when satellite observations began. The trend can be seen throughout the year, but especially in September when the ice cover reaches its minimum extent for the year before starting to build up again."In 2020, there was an unusually rapid decline in Arctic sea ice extent during June and July, in the same region where above average temperatures were recorded, preconditioning the sea ice minimum to be particularly low this year," Carlo Buontempo, Director of Copernicus Climate Change Service said."The combination of record temperatures and low Arctic sea ice in 2020 highlight the importance of improved and more comprehensive monitoring in a region warming faster than anywhere else in the world," he added. Globally, September 2020 was 0.05 degrees Celsius warmer than the same month last year â which had been the warmest on record, according to scientists from Copernicus.In addition, temperatures in the Siberian Arctic continue to be much above average and Arctic sea ice is at its second lowest extent since satellite records began.  Temperatures in September were well above average in many regions across the globe, including off the coast of northern Siberia, and many parts of Europe, with many countries experiencing their warmest September on record.The numbers analyzed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service show that the month was 0.63 degrees Celsius above the average September temperatures of the standard thirty-year climatological reference period (1981-2010).This means that as well as being warmer than last year, this September was also 0.8 degrees Celsius warmer than September 2016, the second-warmest on record.  Europe's September heatwavesAcross Europe, September average temperatures reached a record high, about 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous warmest September of 2018.

The major task is to observe and record the wild animals and their activities, according to Sangmutse, a 58-year-old volunteer and a local official, who comes to the lake every day."This is our book of record for field monitoring. We record the status of birds we see every day. For example, today I saw black-necked cranes, red ducks, swans and some other birds, and there are a lot of them," said Sangmutse. He recalled seeing poachers stealing bird eggs and hunting wild animals when he was young.The volunteers, some without formal school education, have taught themselves the Environment Protection Law and other national and local laws, while explaining to other locals.(Cover image via video screenshot)(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)A group of local residents in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region have formed a team of volunteers to protect the natural environment and the wildlife on the plateau.Tsonag Lake, a freshwater lake with the world's highest altitude and the habitat of many rare wild animals on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, is located in Amdo County, Nagqu Prefecture of Tibet.Attracted by the lake, many wild animals such as black-necked cranes, swans and wild ducks find their home here, and living on the grassland by the lake are Tibetan antelopes and Tibetan gazelles.Supported by the local government of Zharen County, a group of local residents teamed up in 2012.

The downpours have destroyed houses and washed away roads on the border between the two countries near Nice.These storms have been attributed to climate change and scientists believe they're likely to increase in frequency and volume in the years ahead â but hope natural interventions could dramatically reduce their impact. CLICK: HOW THE EDUCATION SECTOR IS ADAPTING TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS  The results of the study showed that in areas where new woodlands have been planted, the ability of soil to absorb water was almost double that of areas with no trees.This means that huge quantities of rainwater could be more readily absorbed by trees, rather than it simply running over the surface and into rivers where it subsequently causes severe flooding.The study's authors say their findings show the planting of more woodlands in upland areas could be an effective and natural flood management tool.Thomas Murphy, who led the research as part of his PhD, said: "Many UK upland areas have a history of soil compaction and the aim of our study was to define how quickly this nature-based solution could affect that."  He added: "People perhaps think that trees need to be mature in order for them to have beneficial environmental effects. But across our four test sites, we showed they can make significant improvements to soil properties within just 15 years of establishment, meaning it can be a viable option for flood prevention in a relatively modest time frame."This nature-based solution could be extremely timely, given the commitment of the UK government to plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 and other environmental schemes designed to enhance carbon retention, biodiversity and flood prevention. But scientists have warned that new woodlands will require careful placement if the benefits are to be maximized. The research concluded that that steep hillsides on the edge of upland areas provide the most effective location for tree plantations to serve as an effective flood-prevention tool.  Planting new woodlands in upland areas could help bring an end to flash flooding in the UK within 15 years, according to a new study published by the University of Plymouth. The UK is just one of several European countries to have been hit by serious flooding in recent years, prompting  research into how trees could be used to absorb rainwater.In February, large parts of the English Midlands and Yorkshire were left submerged in water after Storm Dennis hit the UK, resulting in serious damage to local communities and several deaths.Storm Alex also caused nearly a year's rainfall to come down on France and Italy in the space of just 12 hours this week.

The village is known for its clay pots. For thousands of years, Huayao Dai people have used clay pots to cook meals and store water. Most people in this village can make clay pots, and Dao happens to be one of them. He inherited the skill from his elders.Dao loved to play with clay when he was a child. He learned to make clay pots from his mother and the elderly in the village since he was 13. He showed us how to make a clay pot before firing.

Some of the animals, such as sheep, have not yet been studied with infection tests, so this does not confirm the species can indeed be infected.Lead author Christine Orengo, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "We wanted to look beyond just the animals that had been studied experimentally, to see which animals might be at risk of infection and would warrant further investigation and possible monitoring."The animals we identified may be at risk of outbreaks that could threaten endangered species or harm the livelihoods of farmers. The animals might also act as reservoirs of the virus, with the potential to reinfect humans later on, as has been documented on mink farms."The research team also performed more detailed structural analyses for certain animals, to gain a better understanding of how infection risks may differ across animal species. By comparing their findings to other experimental data, they set thresholds to predict which animals are at risk of infection, and which ones most likely cannot be infected.They found that most birds, fish, and reptiles do not appear to be at risk of infection, but the majority of the mammals they reviewed could potentially be infected.Orengo added: "The details of host infection and severity of response are more complex than just the interactions of the spike protein with ACE2, so our research is continuing to explore interactions involving other host virus proteins."  The team's findings mostly agree with experiments conducted in living animals and with reported cases of infections. They predict possible infection in domestic cats, dogs, mink, lions, and tigers, all of which have had reported cases, as well as ferrets and macaques, which have been infected in laboratory studies.First author, Su Datt Lam, who specializes in structural and molecular biology at UCL and the National University of Malaysia, said: "Unlike laboratory-based experiments, the computational analyses we devised can be run automatically and rapidly. Therefore, these methods could be applied easily to future virus outbreaks that, unfortunately, are becoming more common due to human encroachment into natural habitats."  Co-author Joanne Santini, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "To protect animals, as well as to protect ourselves from the risk of one day catching COVID-19 from an infected animal, we need large-scale surveillance of animals, particularly pets and farm animals, to catch cases or clusters early on while they're still manageable."It may also be important to employ hygiene measures when dealing with animals, similar to the behaviours we've all been learning this year to reduce transmission and for infected people to isolate from animals as well as from other people." Numerous animals may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to a large study modeling how the virus might infect different species' cells.The study, published in Scientific Reports and led by researchers at University College London (UCL) reports evidence that 26 animals regularly in contact with people may be susceptible to infection.The researchers investigated how the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 could interact with the ACE2 protein it attaches to when it infects people.The focus of the investigation was whether mutations in the ACE2 protein in 215 different animals, which make it different from the human version, would reduce the stability of the binding complex between the virus protein and host protein. Binding to the protein enables the virus to gain entry into host cells; while it is possible the virus might be able to infect animals via another pathway, it is unlikely based on current evidence that the virus could infect an animal if it cannot form a stable binding complex with ACE2.  The researchers found that for some animals, such as sheep and great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos, many of which are endangered in the wild), the proteins would be able to bind together just as strongly as they do when the virus infects people.

French authorities said at least eight people were missing, including two firemen whose vehicle was carried away by a swollen river, according to local witnesses.  Army and helicopters join the effortThe French army and hundreds of rescuers were deployed to search for the missing, including using helicopters to transport aid and evacuate people where possible. An emergency services spokesman in France said that around 40 people stranded on roads by the landslides had sheltered in an old train station and then been airlifted to safety.The storm ravaged several villages around the city of Nice on the French Riviera. Nice mayor Christian Estrosi called it the worst flooding disaster in the area for more than a century, after flying over the area by helicopter. "The roads and about 100 houses were swept away or partially destroyed," he told French news channel BFM."I do not hide from you our deep concern about the final outcome of this episode," said prime minister Jean Castex, adding "I have been particularly shocked by what I saw today." Amid concerns that the death toll could rise, Castex said that the government had triggered its emergency plan for handling natural disasters.  In Breil-sur-Roya, a French village close to the Italian border, houses were buried in mud and turned-over cars stuck in the riverbed. Rescue efforts were concentrated on the Roya valley where roughly 1,000 firefighters, backed by helicopters and the army, resumed their search for survivors and helped people whose homes were destroyed or inaccessible.Eric Ciotti, a member of French parliament who is from one of the worst affected villages in the area, Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie, said several villages were cut off in the mountainous region's steep-sided valleys. "The situation is catastrophic in some communes," Ciotti said.Meteo France said that 500 millimeters of rain was registered over 24 hours in Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie, with close to 400 millimeters falling in several other towns â the equivalent of more than three months of rain at this time of the year.Authorities in the southern Alpes-Maritimes region had been placed on alert Friday and around 12,000 people in three valleys to the north of Nice were without power early Saturday afternoon. France has now declared the region a natural disaster zone. Houses 'perched above the void'Roads had been washed away by the waters leaving buildings teetering above the voids. "You can also see a few houses that are perched above the void because the riverbed has washed away the road," said a fire brigade spokesman."We have actually had houses wiped out," said Alpes-Maritimes prefect Bernard Gonzalez. "What we are going through is extraordinary.""My three-story house, it's in the river," said villager Sandra Dzidt, 62, who had to flee the floods dressed only in her nightgown. "All I have left is a tiny piece of wall and a door."  "We are thunderstruck. We saw the (river) Vesubie burst its banks â everything was swept away, including part of the old iron bridge," said Serge Franco, a resident of the Alpes-Maritimes village Roquebilliere."My house is habitable but half of my land has been swept away," said another resident, Guillaume Andre, who was evacuated overnight but returned to see the devastation after daybreak."I lost everything but we are alive," said Roquebilliere resident Jennyfer. "There must be one room left in my house.""The firefighters did not have enough rope, and even with our rope we could not reach the house, so it was too late to get to them and the house was suddenly swept away," added resident Patrick Theus.Gonzalez called on the families of the missing not to give up hope. "Just because their loved ones haven't been able to get in touch doesn't mean that they have been taken by the storm," he said. Many landline and some mobile phone services were disrupted, with some villages using satellite phones to communicate with rescue services.Despite forecasts of more rain, Gonzalez insisted that rescue efforts were to continue throughout Sunday. "The helicopter procession will continue all day long," he said.  Director of civil protection JÃ©rÃ©my Crunchant said there was heavier rainfall than on 3 October 2015, when floods caused the death of 20 people in and around the French Riviera city of Cannes.The presidents of Italy's Piedmont and Liguria regions signed a joint letter calling on the government to declare a state of emergency with several villages cut off. The mayor of the northern Italian city of Ventimiglia, Gaetano Scullino, said "a disaster of this kind has not happened since 1958."Cirio added Italy was already struggling to cope with the effects of the coronavirus which has left some 36,000 dead and shattered the economy over the past six months."We are already in an extraordinary situation," he said. "Because of the pandemic the region will this year receive 200 million euros ($234 million) less in tax receipts. If the state does not intervene we shall not recover."Meanwhile in Venice, a long-delayed flood barrier system including a network of 78 artificial dykes successfully protected the lagoon city from a high tide for the first time on Saturday, bringing huge relief following years of repeated inundations. Storm Alex has left at least three people dead and eight missing in southern France and northern Italy, bringing record rainfall in places and causing heavy flooding that swept away roads, damaged homes and left thousands without power.In Italy, at least two people died â a volunteer firefighter in the Aosta Valley and a man whose car was swept into the River Sesia in northern Italy after a road subsided.The water level in the River Po jumped by three meters in just 24 hours and officials in the Piedmont region reported a record 630 millimeters of rain in just 24 hours in Sambughetto, close to Italy's border with Switzerland. Dozens of firefighters were trying to reach one village by train after the road was shut, while neighboring Switzerland was also battered with record rainfall and powerful gusts, forcing the closure of roads and mountains. CLICK: THE CREWLESS, SOLAR-POWERED 'MAYFLOWER' MAKING THE SAME JOURNEY AS ITS HISTORIC NAMESAKE France suffered its first fatality on Sunday, a shepherd whose body was pulled from a river near the border.

Many landline and some mobile phone services were disrupted, with some villages using satellite phones to communicate with rescue services.Despite forecasts of more rain, Gonzalez insisted that rescue efforts were to continue throughout Sunday. "The helicopter procession will continue all day long," he said.  Director of civil protection JÃ©rÃ©my Crunchant said there was heavier rainfall than on 3 October 2015, when floods caused the death of 20 people in and around the French Riviera city of Cannes.The presidents of Italy's Piedmont and Liguria regions signed a joint letter calling on the government to declare a state of emergency with several villages cut off. The mayor of the northern Italian city of Ventimiglia, Gaetano Scullino, said "a disaster of this kind has not happened since 1958."Cirio added Italy was already struggling to cope with the effects of the coronavirus which has left some 36,000 dead and shattered the economy over the past six months."We are already in an extraordinary situation," he said. "Because of the pandemic the region will this year receive 200 million euros ($234 million) less in tax receipts. If the state does not intervene we shall not recover."Meanwhile in Venice, a long-delayed flood barrier system including a network of 78 artificial dykes successfully protected the lagoon city from a high tide for the first time on Saturday, bringing huge relief following years of repeated inundations. The silver jewelry culture in Tonghai County, Yuxi City, Yunnan Province can be traced back to the Mongolians from the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368). Tonghai silver jewelry "Peacock" is now a well-known Chinese brand.The history of "Peacock" jewelry can be traced back to the Qing Dynasty (1636-1912); in 1851, Tonghai silver jewelry was highly popular.

With the help of the government, they have moved out from the deep mountains and started a new life in well-constructed communities.Walking into the kitchen of a Dulong family, we found modern electrical appliances, a traditional fire pit and, surprisingly, a black piglet sleeping very well beside the warm fire. Unlike dogs or cats which are kept for pets, the pig is one of their livestock. Living with animals is common among some ethnic groups who living in remote areas. The fire pit sits on a three-legged iron frame.

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

When one enters through the gates, one will quickly notice a serene environment, lush bushes, and trees with birds perching here and there.The sanctuary hosts a large number of free grazing impalas, the rare Sitatunga antelope, Zebras, and the vervet monkeys.The caged animals include lions, leopards, buffalo, Ostrich, guinea fowls, and the baboons.This sanctuary is one of three in Kenya that was established to protect and rehabilitate wild animals as well as educate the public on wildlife conservation efforts. Others are the Nairobi Safari Walk and the Nairobi orphanage.Paul Omondi, the warden in charge of the Sanctuary says: "The reason why we have the orphanage and the safari walk and the impala sanctuary is that it is a refuge for the rescued wildlife, probably from human-wildlife conflict or problematic animals, the injured, and the orphaned. So the sanctuary is a way of offering them a home.âHere, unlike in the national parks, one will have a rare opportunity of seeing some of the animals up-close. The sanctuary is home to hundreds of impalas which boasts of the largest population followed by the Zebras.While taking a walk through the sanctuary, we observed herds of these herbivores which were busy grazing in the morning hours taking advantage of the cool breeze on the shores of the lake.Kisumu sun can be unforgiving, and it is based on this that Mr. Omondi encourages those who are interested in interacting with the animals as they feed, to always make it to the sanctuary in the morning before they retreat into the bushes away from the scorching sun."In terms of conservation fees for entry into the sanctuary, we charge adults Kenyans, Ksh. 200/$2 while children pay Ksh. 100/$1. For non-residents, we charge Ksh.2000/$20 and children Ksh.1500/$15." said Omondi.The low seasons for tourists both local and international are between January and April. The peak season runs between July and August while the high season remains to be September and December.However this year, the Sanctuary saw reduced numbers of visitors due to restrictions that were put in place by health authorities in an effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic spread.Lifespan in the cages vis a vis the wildLife in the wild is tough coupled with a rough terrain where only those who are swift survive.But as CGTN's Halligan Agade discovered, animals in this sanctuary seem to be enjoying life to the fullest because they are accessed to food and treatment unlike their counterparts in the wild.No wonder then Mr. Omondi submits that those in the wild have a shorter lifespan as compared to the caged ones, with the big cats for instance the lion likely to live up to 15 years even more in the cage."In the wild you know it is survival for the fittest but under captive management, the animals within the sanctuary tend to live longer because they are looked after, they are fed and treated."But there is another danger lurking in the shadows for these caged animals. Obesity. Just like humans, if caution is not taken, the Warden says, some animals especially the carnivores can be obese and this calls for the services of a veterinary expert to keep monitoring them since they do not run after their prey which is a form of exercise. This natural activity is only available in the wild."In terms of the feeding program, we're guided by our Veterinary team who come to inspect the animals on a monthly basis just to check the condition of the sanctuary, condition of the animals, the feeding regime, and the treatment regime."Controlled breedingBut it is not just obesity that is to be considered for the big cats, but the uncontrolled numbers of the herbivores like the Impalas must also be in check to control inbreeding to conserve a generation to make sure it does not face extinction arising from impure breeds."When we have a lot of animals like the impalas, we trans-locate them to Ndeere Island National Park. This is done in consultation with the species and research department in Nairobi. This is done to reduce the numbers and also give the excess numbers new habitat or new homes and also as a way of reducing inbreeding among the impalas that we have within the sanctuary."Interestingly, it is only the herbivores that can be translocated to the wild, however, for the carnivores, it doesn't happen."In captive management, in terms of the wild, it is a bit different for the lions that are under captive management. They are under cages, and they are fed. When you take them to the wild, they will have to fend for themselves and this is a habit they will have to learn. This poses a great danger to them in terms of survival and also existence." Omondi adds.But thanks to this sanctuary the endangered animals now have a place to call home.Free-ranging and captive animals are not the only attraction here, but bird-life, indigenous forest, swampy papyrus areas, grassland, rocky view area, nature trails, and sundowner viewpoint is also on the card for nature lovers.Set on the shore of Lake Victoria, the Kisumu Impala Sanctuary is just a ten minutes drive from the city center.

Other artifacts and at least 28 statues were found in the two deep wells, the ministry said.A sealed door was also unearthed where it is expected more mummies may lie behind, said Khaled el-Anany the first Minister of Antiquities and Tourism, adding that the artifacts were in an excellent state of preservation and would be displayed in the Grand Egyptian museum next year.Mostafa Waziri, the general director of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told NBC News that the discovery reminded him of the tomb of King Tutankhamun, because both had been discovered almost intact.The Saqqara plateau is part of the necropolis of Egypt's ancient city of Memphis.

Virtually all the damage has been done since mid-August, when five of the six largest fires in state history erupted. Lightning strikes caused some of the most devastating blazes.Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said wildfires have scorched 3.9 million acres in California since Aug. 15. That figure, which works out to over 6,000 square miles (15,500 square kilometers), is astonishing even in a state that has had its fair share of fires."It's likely that over the next day or two we will crest the 4-million-acre mark. The biggest year before this year was 1.54 million," Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said. "We are dwarfing that previous record and we have a lot of season left to go."Fire officials said the Glass Fire had first priority. Since erupting last Sunday, the fire has destroyed nearly 600 buildings, including 220 homes and nearly the same number of commercial structures.Some 80,000 people were under evacuation orders, which were expanded on Thursday.Four million acres have been burned this year by wildfires and leaving behind a trail of death of 30 people and incinerated hundreds of homes in what is already the worst fire season on record in California.The fires have torched an area larger than Connecticut and fire crews at a blaze in the northern wine country were on high alert as forecasters warned of red flag conditions of extreme fire danger into Saturday morning.Winds up to 30 mph (48 kph) were forecast to push through the hills in Napa and Sonoma counties as the Glass Fire, exploded in size earlier in the week, continued to threaten more than 28,000 homes and other buildings."It's a time of nervousness," said Paul Gullixon, a spokesman for Sonoma County.Winds were blowing at higher elevations on the western side of the fire and crews expected a long battle to keep flames from jumping containment lines and spot fires from leaping ahead to spark new blazes."It's going to be a big firefight for us over the next 36 hours," said Billy See, an assistant chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.More crews and equipment were deployed in and around Calistoga, a town of 5,000 people known for hot springs, mud baths and wineries in the hills of Napa County about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of San Francisco.The area was also experiencing high temperatures and thick smoke that fouled the air throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.Around the state, 17,000 firefighters were battling nearly two dozen major blazes.

said on Friday.Authorities declared a three-month state of emergency in early September after the worst flooding in 30 years.To date, more than 860,000 people have had houses destroyed or damaged and more than 120 people have died.Some 560 schools and thousands of health facilities have also been affected, compromising essential services to communities, especially in North Darfur, Khartoum, West Darfur, and Sennar, which account for 52 percent of all people affected.400,000 reached and countingThe response by UN agencies and partners has reached more than 400,000 people so far, including emergency shelter and essential household items relief to over 181,000 flood-affected refugees, 1.87 million internally displaced people, and Sudanese across the country.Meanwhile, COVID-19 virus transmission has continued, with 13,653 confirmed cases of the pandemic with 836 deaths, according to official data from the World Health Organization (WHO).Amid growing needs, surging inflation â reaching nearly 170 percent in August â has caused a shortage of basic commodities and increased prices of some locally sourced supplies by 300 to 400 percent."In some cases, by the time the procurement process is finalized, the supplies have increased prices, so that the original budgets are no longer valid," said OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke.He explained that this meant the purchasing process had to begin again and "there is no guarantee that by the time that that process is done, that the prices will not have risen once again".Healthcare costs have also increased by up to 90 percent, OCHA Sudan said in a recent tweet.In Geneva, Mr. Laerke noted that the price of an average family food basket had increased by over 200 percent since last year, based on World Food Programme (WFP) data, increasing pressure on already dramatic levels of food insecurity across Sudan, where 9.6 million people are described as "severely " in need.Cash shortfallsInflation has also affected the UN's humanitarian partners which provide cash support to vulnerable families, as they are constantly having to adjust the amounts transferred, Mr. Laerke said.Even with these adjustments, many families are no longer able to purchase what they need with the cash received.Today, only one in four families who previously relied on outside assistance now receives it, the OCHA spokesperson said.Crop failureAnother concern in Sudan is that large areas of farmland are underwater or ruined just before harvest."Most families in Sudan already spent around 65 percent of their income on food, so these price hikes lead to increased hunger and less education, health and other services that families de-prioritize as they try to cope with the economic hardship,"

caused unprecedented rainfall and flooding in others.Africa's largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria is one such example.Water levels in the lake are at unprecedented heights due to more than a year of heavy rains in the East African region.According to Eastern Africa Consortium for Clinical Research, the current rise in the lake began on 1st October 2019 and significantly went up from 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020. It was a 1.32 meters rise attained in only 6 months before hitting an all-time high of 13.42-meter mark by September this year.However, heavy rain isn't the only thing fueling Lake Victoria's rising levels. Environmental degradation, urbanization, and other human activity all play a part.Dr. Raymond Omollo the Director at Lake Basin Development Authority says that development is good for humanity, but it can also change the ecosystem."On the Ugandan side, there has been a huge hydro-project, so again that limits the amount of water that is flowing out of the lake at any given time. With this, you have the backflow so then you do not release as much water as you would ordinarily," Dr. Omollo says.The Kenyan government is also constructing dams to help manage the flow of water to the lake. Authorities have embarked on afforestation programs to help water catchment areas to reduce soil erosion.Human activities along the shores of the lake have also impacted the massive lake especially deforestation and agricultural activities.Officials say that there must be a concerted effort to target these activities and make sure that they are controlled to save the lake."In order for us to manage this easily, firstly we must target the areas where people do agriculture because that's where land has been opened up. Cultivation has been done and any little rain will wash away the topsoil, get it into the river, and from there, it will go settling," Ken K'oyoo the Director of the Environment in Kisumu County explains.People close to the lake are being advised to relocate to other areas. Officials worry the lake might continue to swell and displace more people who have lived along its shores for over a half a century now."When you drive along the lake, there are huge investments whether in the hospitality industry and when the water levels rise, a number of facilities in Kisumu were not usable, because they were partly submerged," Dr. Omollo adds.Climate change has become one of the main agendas of the United Nations Environment-UNEP with the clarion call that global citizens must unite to reduce its impact. The changing weather patterns have without a doubt resulted in many natural disasters across the world and loss of lives."It is a pointer to the fact that climate change is real and unless we are able to make our voices heard and do something about its impact, then very soon we would probably lose a lot of livelihoods and the beautiful lake, the resource that we have might end up being a curse rather than a blessing," Dr. Omollo says.Climate change has not only led to drought, wildfires, and ice melting in some parts of the globe, but it has also caused unprecedented rainfall and flooding in others.Africa's largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria is one such example.Water levels in the lake are at unprecedented heights due to more than a year of heavy rains in the East African region.According to Eastern Africa Consortium for Clinical Research, the current rise in the lake began on 1st October 2019 and significantly went up from 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020.

Through a tidy array of lights, the enormous natural power is seen pushing the waves forward and pounding against riverbanks harshly, as if countless of silver dragons were vigorously swimming.Under the background of light beams near the river, viewers can savor a skillful water painting created by nature.It looks like a landscape painting on water, but on a closer look, it also looks like a flowing music score that plays grandiose symphonies.According to local authorities, the scenic area has received more than 5,000 visitors within five days by October 1. The number of daily views is estimated to reach a peak on October 4, the 18th day of the eighth month on Chinese lunar calendar, when the tidal bores reach their most spectacular moment.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Jingjie)Now is the best time to admire the Tidal Bore of the Qiantang River, an annual natural spectacle, in east China's coastal city.The picturesque scene featuring magnificent tidal bores rushing under the luminous moon attracted crowds of locals and visitors in Haining City, Zhejiang Province on Thursday night.Since ancient times, the world-famous Qiantang Tidal Bore, which is created by the gravity from the moon and the rotation of the Earth, has been hailed as a "marvelous spectacle on earth."One of the world's largest tidal bores ushered in the best time of the year for sightseeing with the advent of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, coinciding with China's National Day.It has been a great tradition and local custom in the eastern province for over 2,000 years to enjoy the natural wonder and celebrate under the full moon around the festival, when the tidal waves become the biggest bores.The best vantage point for watching the amazing back-flow bore in Haining City made a big innovation this year to improve tourists' experience.Tourists flocking to the riversides can enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to not only hear but watch the amazing scene at night owing to the elaborately designed light beam arrays.The Qiantang Tidal Bore is also called "the Silver Dragon" by locals.

These measures, such as expediting legislation to protect biodiversity, drawing red lines for ecological protection, establishing a national park system, undertaking major projects for biodiversity protection, and coordinating and advancing biodiversity management will help the country to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and to ensure China's greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2030. He also called for multilateralism in protecting biodiversity.French President Emmanuel Macron stressed the need to step up the fight against environmental crime, and to put a definitive end to all illegal activities that endanger nature, destroy ecosystems, feed corruption, hinder the development of the rule of law and, ultimately undermine the sustainable development of humanity. He also called for the transformation of the current models of production, trade and consumption, as well as public investment to enable the transformation. He also said France will mobilize for the adoption of an ambitious new global strategic framework for the protection of biodiversity at next year's UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is striving to be a leader in protecting the environment, and surpassed its target of protecting 10 percent of marine areas by 2020. He pledged to protect 30 percent of land and oceans by 2030.While many countries have joined the UN in pledging to protect 30 percent of their land and seas by 2030, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro strongly opposed "international greed" towards the Amazon rainforest, and said that countries have the right to use their natural resources and "that is precisely what we intend to do with the huge wealth of resources found in the Brazilian territory."Our planet is facing severe threats from biodiversity loss and requires urgent attention and efforts to reverse the damage. Recent assessments by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) concluded that species extinction rates are tens to hundreds of times higher now than historical averages.Seventy-five percent of the Earth's land surface has been significantly altered by human actions, including the loss of 85 percent of wetlands area, and 66 percent of the ocean is experiencing multiple impacts from people, including from fisheries, pollution, and chemical changes from acidification.(With input from Xinhua and statistics from UN official website.

Currently only six crops are used, including maize, sugarcane and palm oil.Plants form the basis of many medicines that treat major diseases such as cancer and dementia. The report noted 700 of them are at risk of extinction, with thousands more species remaining unexplored in terms of what benefits they could bring.  Researchers also concluded the world is overly dependent on a tiny fraction of plants for crops, with new data suggesting more than 7,000 edible varieties could be potential future foods.Paul Kersey, an expert in plant genetics at RGBKew, revealed he is working on a project to analyze wild relatives of coffee beans harvested in Ethiopia. He said existing coffee species are severely threatened by climate change but new species may be more suitable.   "We're continually finding new relatives of existing edible species," he told CGTN. "Some of these may be underused, some of these may be extremely important when the climate changes and stress is put on existing crops we grow and some may be just sources of useful genes we can use to make existing crops better."Could plants and fungi provide solutions to global warming, food security and effective medicines? The answer is yes, according to the the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, which has just released its fourth State of the World's Plants and Fungi report.The study is the collaborative work of 210 experts from 42 countries who claim it provides concrete evidence that plants and fungi hold the keys to tackling some of the most serious challenges facing the world's population.  But there is also cause for concern â researchers said two in five plants are threatened with extinction, more than previously thought.  "The plants and fungal kingdoms are one of our most untapped resources in terms of biodiversity," said Olwen Grace, who led on the bio-energy section of the report compiled by scientists at Kew. "Plants and fungi meet our everyday needs already in terms of food, energy, medicine, but there's real potential to tap this treasure chest even further to address our most urgent questions â we need more food, we need better, cleaner energy and this is what the report addresses.âAccording to the report, there are 2,500 plant varieties that could provide clean energy for millions of people worldwide.

As well as providing a habitat for many marine species, it also captures carbon 35 times faster than a rainforest. But in recent years, fields of the plant have shrunk as a result of pollution, an influx in fishing and a rise in coastal development.  CLICK: FOR MORE STORIES FROM RAZOR, CGTN'S BRAND NEW SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWThe group of marine biologists from Swansea University, backed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Sky Ocean Rescue, has embarked on a $515,000 project named Project Seagrasses to restore the meadows to their previous state. RAZOR's Jo Colan joined the team of scientists in Dale Fort, Wales as they began the first ever seagrass restoration replanting in the UK. Richard Unsworth, one of the marine biologists in the team said: "Seagrasses have been decimated around the UK. We think that the UK has lost at least 90 percent of its seagrass. So it remains a scattered, fragmented habitat that used to be a very dominant part of the coast of the UK."Over the summer, the team collected more than 750,000 seeds from across the UK and then transported them back to the University's labs.The seeds were then washed and artificially vernalised (kept at a near-freezing temperature to mimic the winter season.) After that, the temperature was increased, allowing them to germinate, before they were put in bags and dropped into the sea.  They used the help of children from a local primary school to help fill the bags with seeds, with the hope it will help the next generation get a better understanding of the importance of the process."We came up with the idea of using a pretty simplistic little bag, the sort of hessian bag that your Christmas soap gets packed in and gets a little bow on it. Making sure they are nicely topped up with sand," Unsworth added, saying there are about 50 seeds in each bag.In around six months, the first seagrass shoots from the project are expected to emerge on the seabed."Well, we face a growing climate emergency and we have to make important rapid steps as a planet to fight that emergency. Seagrasses store vast amounts of carbon in their sediments. And they do that very, very rapidly so it can stay and remain locked away for millennia. We also face a biodiversity emergency, where all populations of all major animals and plants on this planet are in decline," Unsworth explained.Video editing: Natalia LuzA team of UK scientists has launched an "emergency" seagrass restoration project to try to revive the country's underwater meadows. World leaders are set to meet on Wednesday at a United Nations summit to discuss the "urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development" as it continues to be a growing global issue. Seagrass is the only flowering plant in the world that can pollinate underwater.

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report last year found nearly 1 million species are on the verge of extinction.The Living Planet Report prepared by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Zoological Society of London calculated global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish decline by an average two-third in less than half a century.In order to protect the global biodiversity, world leaders committed to 20 targets in 2010 during a meeting at Aichi in Japan. None of the 20 targets agreed on by the governments were able to be met, found a review of the 'Aichi Targets" released early this month. The summit will be an opportunity to demonstrate ambition to accelerate action on controlling and reversing the biodiversity loss, said the CBD. The commitments made at New York would undergo revision and leaders would decide a new biodiversity framework during the Conference of Parties (COP15), UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China next year."We call on all leaders to build on this ambition at the forthcoming UN Summit on Biodiversity," said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF-International."Together, they must develop and agree on a shared plan for the biodiversity and climate negotiations scheduled for next year, to secure a carbon-neutral, nature-positive and equitable future for all.

"The reasons for this are unclear," they said. "Lots of factors could affect the changing of numbers of sea turtles sighted," said Zara Botterell of the University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. "Climate change, prey availability and environmental disasters such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill could all influence turtle numbers and behavior."The record shows a dramatic increase in the turtle sightings in the 1980s and 1990s, which researchers attribute to the rising public interest in conservation activities and a better reporting mechanism. Of the seven different sea turtle species, six of them â green, hawksbill, kemp's ridley, leatherback, loggerhead, and the olive ridley â are found in both warm and cold water oceans in many countries. But the flatback turtles reside only in Australia, Indonesia and Southern Papua New Guinea.In the UK and Ireland, leatherback sea turtles are regularly spotted, making up 1,683 of the 1,997 sightings since 1910. These turtles visit the country's ocean during the summer months to feast on jellyfish. The record shows spotting of 240 loggerheads, 61 Kemp's ridley turtles during winter months. These turtles might have been carried on currents and are stranded in cold waters. But only 11 green turtles, one hawksbill and one olive ridley sightings were found in the record. Most of the recorded sightings of turtles in the UK and Ireland were along western and southern coasts. Of the 1,997 turtles sighted, 143 were "bycatch" (caught accidentally) in fishing lines, nets and ropes â and the large majority of these were released alive.But researchers claim that the sea turtle populations in the North Atlantic are mostly stable or increasing. "The apparent decrease may represent reduced reporting rather than fewer turtles in our seas," said Botterell."One reason for this could be that fewer fishing boats are at sea now than in the past â and fishers are the most likely people to see and report turtles," she added. Concerned over the depleting population of sea turtles, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has already declared kemp's ridley, hawksbil and green sea turtles critically endangered, seeking the intervention of the governments.Leatherback, olive ridley, green and loggerhead turtles have been placed under the endangered list. There is not enough data available about flatback turtles.  "We have been lucky to analyze this unique dataset that exists because Britain and Ireland are a real hotbed of engaged citizen science, said Professor Brendan Godley, who leads the Exeter Marine research group. "Members of the public report their sightings in schemes supported by conservation charities and government bodies."(Cover: Researchers measuring a leatherback sea turtle in the UK. /Jane Newman)Red-billed leiothrix has been regarded as the bird of love since ancient times as they repeatedly appeared in literature, symbolizing the solid romantic relationship built on loyalty. (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Swans stopped at Bosten Lake in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region on their migration journey south.The seasonal journey, driven by the need to breed in the spring and forage in the winter, is shared by many migratory birds across the world.(All images photoed by Nian Lei)(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Marine conservationists have expressed concern over the declining number of endangered sea turtle sightings along the coasts of the UK and Ireland. A study of the record, dating back to more than a century from 1910-2018 by the University of Exeter scientists, shows that the turtle's sightings have dropped since 2000.

Up till the end of last year, eight out of nine projected goals had been accomplished in terms of concentration of fine particles, carbon emissions, water quality and the elimination of other chemical pollutants, Zhao Yingmin, vice minister of ecology and environment, said.Zhao told a press conference on October 21 that the number of days with excellent or good air quality in 2020 is expected to reach 84.5% by the end of the year, comfortably meeting the goal as outlined in the plan.On top of that, China has also contributed significantly to tackling climate change by controlling carbon emissions, promoting energy conservation, boosting the development of green energy and actively participating in international governance. Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP continues to decline and carbon intensity has decreased by 18.2% compared to 2015. Since 2010, sales of new energy cars have taken up 55 percent of the global figure, making China the country with the largest number of new energy vehicles in the world.Zhao said the achievement is the result of a continuously improved management system in the construction of ecological civilization and stronger laws and regulation. Having said that, challenges still remain. "Our industrial structure still relies heavily on the chemical industry, the energy industry still mainly relies on coal, and transportation is still highway-based," Zhao said. "Meanwhile, the world is undergoing profound and complex changes, the risks and challenges are growing every day, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. China's environmental protection is still an arduous task and the road ahead is long and tortuous.""We will continue our efforts in environmental protection and fighting against climate change based on the previous experiences in the next five years." (All photos via VCG. )(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)China experienced its greatest improvement in ecological and environmental protection from 2016 to 2020 after the completion of the main objectives and tasks outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.This year is the last year of the plan in which more attention has been given to environmental protection â targets for cutting carbon emissions and optimizing energy use.

The iconic marsupials, with some of the strongest jaws on the planet, were recently released into a sprawling, biodiversity-rich reserve in New South Wales."They are on their own. There's no food, no shelter, monitoring takes place four times a year through a tracking system and process, but the devils are out there," said Aussie Ark president Tim Faulkner.It's not known what led to the end of the devils' existence on the mainland."It may have been a mix of Aboriginal hunting, a mix of people bringing dingoes from Southeast Asia into Australia, it also might have been a couple of climate snaps that reduced prey availability for devils and potentially even disease," said Rewilding Australia director Rob Brewster.The devils continued to thrive in Tasmania until the 1990's when a facial tumor disease wiped out about 90 percent of the wild population.That prompted conservation efforts to increase disease-free numbers.It also eventually led to a plan involving species recovery specialists Aussie Ark to bring healthy Tasmanian devils to a unique, fenced wildlife sanctuary in Barrington Tops. "It is the most northerly part of Antarctic beach forest and sub-alpine Montagne swamps in Australia. It is the most southerly distribution of subtropical rainforests," said Faulkner. "It got an elevation change from sea level to 1,400 meters above sea level and so it is a mixing pot and a melting pot of biodiversity. It is home to 15 percent of all vertebrate fauna in Australia.â Australia has lost more mammals to extinction than any other country in the world, which experts say is largely due to introduced predators such as foxes and feral cats. They are counting on the devils to play a vital role in protecting other endangered species. "The devil has a role and impact on feral pests and it maintains balance within an ecosystem. So to bring them back to the mainland, they present no threat to humans, they present no threat to livestock. It is very unique in terms of a top order predator, but what they do critically in the absence of any other solution is control and disrupt numbers and populations of the feral fox and the feral cat, which are almost singularly related to almost all of our mammal extinctions," said Faulkner.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)After a 3,000-year absence, Tasmanian devils have made a return to Australia's mainland.

Thanks years of painstaking efforts, however, Qingyang has gradually brought the loss under control, Xinhua News Agency reported.The local water resources authority devised terraced fields and planted trees such as pines and sea buckthorn on slopes. At the bottom of the slopes, dams have been built to stop muddy water from flowing into the river.Data from the local soil and water conservation bureau showed the city lost about 98 million metric tonnes of soil last year, down by more than 40 percent from the average annual loss in the 1980s."Nevertheless, to maintain the declining trend nationwide, further efforts are needed, especially in areas severely hit by soil erosion such as Northeast and Southwest China and the Yangtze and Yellow river basins," the Ministry said. "Also, it is possible for areas that have been treated to revert into regions affected by soil erosion if results are not well maintained."A one-year campaign launched by the ministry last month targets illegal projects and activities that cause soil erosion in 71 cities and more than 450 counties in the Yellow River Basin. It will be followed by strict supervision measures."Theoretically, soil resources are renewable, but they will be drained under intense influence from human activities," stated the Ministry.Research by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geochemistry in 2006 found that it takes up to 3,000 years to form 1 centimeter of soil in parts of China with karst landforms, but that can be lost in just a few heavy rainstorms if not protected well.With nearly 30 percent of China's land currently affected by soil erosion, the ministry said there is an urgent need to minimize the depletion of soil because it causes harm to diversity and the economy, along with geological disasters and infrastructural damage.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said last year that soil erosion may reduce global crop yields by up to 10 percent by 2050 â the equivalent of removing millions of hectares of land from crop production.The Ministry said it will step up efforts to slow down soil erosion and prevent environmental damage caused by development activities.(Original editor: Li Hongyang)(All images via CFP)(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Further reduction of soil erosion in China is becoming increasingly difficult as the remaining affected areas â which have seen four decades of progress that have reduced the extent of the problem and its intensity â are "tougher and more complicated" to deal with, the Ministry of Water Resources has said.The latest data, released by the Ministry in August, said 2.71 million square kilometers of land experienced soil erosion last year, down by almost 1 percent from 2018 and 26 percent from the 1980s.The improvement was due to various water conservancy projects, including transforming slope farmland that is more likely to lose soil when it rains into a combination of terraced farmland, forests and grassland.For example, the Loess Plateau, located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, remains one of the most severely eroded areas in China due to its hilly terrain and heavy summer rains.In the 1980s, about 10 percent of the soil that entered the Yellow River each year came from Qingyang, a city on the plateau in Gansu Province.

And then potentially the chemistry of the river is damaged as well."Prior to the arrival of sewage, the Chess's riverbed was lined with minerals to create perfect conditions for fish and wildlife to thrive. It remains popular with fishermen and dog walkers and is a haven for brown trout, the endangered water vole and many other species â but everything that depends on it is under threat from pollution.  The sewage discharge is one key reason the River Chess failed chemical pollution tests, according to a recent UK government report by the Environment Agency. But data gathered from lakes, rivers and streams all across England over three years up paint a grim picture nationwide. Only 14 percent of rivers were found to have a "good ecological status" and none proved to be entirely pollution free. The report says population growth, land use and climate change are all contributing to the problem. "Obviously there is a widespread and endemic problem with pollution in our rivers," says Mark Lloyd, CEO of the Rivers Trust, an umbrella organization that works to protect UK rivers. "And really that's from two sources, principally â from sewage pollution and from agriculture. There's also a problem with urban pollution and run-off from roads. We have solved some of those gross pollution issues from the past, but we have new threats, we have new emerging chemicals, things like flame retardants and PCBs and things that are very persistent in the environment."Water companies were also criticized in a separate recent government report by the Environment Agency.

"Our system seems to routinely cause those overflows, because the system is so overloaded with the proliferation of hard surfaces and also population growth," says Lloyd."We're really asking our sewers to do a job they weren't designed for. And so, we need to design sewers fit for the future, including climate change. It's been designed around a system that is hundreds of years old. It combines surface water with foul sewage. That really does need to be completely reverse engineered."Thames Water, which operates the sewage storm tanks in Ewell and the water treatment works along the River Chess, says that in some cases sewage discharge is unavoidable."We work hard to minimize storm discharges, while also looking at how we can improve the system for the future, including reducing groundwater infiltration and increasing capacity," the company said in a statement. "We've also invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills occur and help us plan improvements."  Along the River Chess, regular monitoring of pollution is done by volunteers, with the help of equipment loaned by Queen Mary University of London. Jennings believes the government should be helping more. "They're not looking at this as they should do and they're not protecting our rivers, as we believe they should do," he says. "So, we have to intervene and push the Environment Agency, push government, push the water companies to take action."The government says it is trying to tackle the problem. A spokesperson for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The latest water classification results show we need to go further and faster to protect our water environment, in particular chalk streams like the River Chess. That's why we have set up a task force to set out clear proposals to reduce the frequency and volumes of sewage discharged by storm overflows."Whatever the solutions, they are likely to take time to implement and for real improvement to show.

"So, this isn't exactly something new, but it has escalated and become a lot more severe because of the pandemic and so what we are seeing is there has been a bit of backlash in terms of creating more negative attitudes towards bats."Following the outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998, which was transmitted from fruit bats to pigs and then to humans, most research in the country has focused on the flying fox and other bats' role as possible vectors of disease."I knew from research done in other countries that they actually played as very major and important role in maintaining the health of our tropical ecosystems," said Dr. Sheema, co-founder of Rimba, a non-profit group of scientists."At the same time, I found out that the flying foxes are disappearing very rapidly because of human activities, such as hunting and clearing forests and mangroves."They are not just hunted for food and medicine. Fruit farmers often kill them too."It just seemed like this was a very important issue that was being overlooked and ignored," Sheema said.Rimba's Project Pteropus â pteropus being the Latin name for the flying fox â aims to fill that knowledge gap.Hauling himself up a towering durian tree with rope pulley, a man sets up a camera to capture night time images of the bats' activities.Farmers of the much-prized durian fruit had long believed that the bats knocked the durian flowers off the tree, reducing their yields. In fact, the opposite is true."They're  playing this very important role in durian farms where they're helping to actually pollinate the durian flowers," Sheema said."Malaysia flying foxes play this unique dual role in a number of ecosystems, such as rainforests, mangroves, peat swamps, freshwater swamps. They're both seed dispersers and also pollinators. So, when they carry fruits away, they're actually helping to carry seeds away and helping to plant these seeds in other parts of the landscape, but then they're also visiting flowers to drink nectar as well, collecting pollen and then transferring the pollen somewhere else."Still, their furry canine-like faces have done little to endear them to fruit farmers."Fruit farmers have complained about flying foxes feeding on the fruit crops in the past, and they believe this necessitates eradicating the flying foxes."Project Pteropus has set out to research the role the flying fox bats play in the ecosystem to counter the negative perceptions â and the unnecessary killing. Rimba has produced posters and animated videos to reach out to the public and gone to the ground to educate farmers.Eric Chong runs an ecolodge and fruit orchard on the northern island of Penang."At my neighbor's farm, they are actually putting up nets to trap the bats, especially around their fruit trees," he said."When we first got the farm, our caretaker had advised us to leave the bats alone, they actually will help the farm, so we left the bats alone, not having much proof of actually what bats do."Then Rimba showed him the night camera video of the bats interacting with the durian flowers."When I saw that video of the bats pollinating the durian flowers, yeah, I was very convinced of their beneficial impact," Chong said.He believes other farmers would be too.But Rimba knows there's more than just misperception at work here. Flying foxes aren't dubbed fruit bats for no reason."We need to start investigating and trialling mitigation methods in partnership with the farmers so that we can look into ways that we can help protect the fruit crops from the bats without actually killing the bats," Sheema said.Rimba is also reaching out to educate the broader public too."Anyone who might be hunting or killing flying foxes, they actually need to stop this kind of practice because if the flying fox disappears from the ecosystem, if they disappear from Malaysia, they could be very negative impacts on all of us on our well-being, on the economy, on industries."As for fears about bats as spreaders of deadly disease, "All they need to do to avoid infection risk from bats is really to just leave bats alone, not to consume them, not to disturb them, not to kill them."(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)From a public relations standpoint, it's not a good time to be a bat â much less a member of the flying fox fruit bat species linked to the spread of COVID-19."Bats have always had this negative reputation in general," said Malaysian researcher Sheema Abdul Aziz.

The world is curious about how China will achieve this ambitious goal. Alok Gupta spoke to Professor Li Zheng and He Jiankun from the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University about how China plans to reduce emissions to zero. Below are excerpts from the interview edited for clarity. What are the major challenges for China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060?China's carbon dioxide emissions would reach its peak by 2030, which means we have 30 years to meet the carbon neutrality deadline. But developed countries have 50-70 years, so our future emissions reduction process will be very urgent.The share of manufacturing in China's economy is much higher than those in developed countries, resulting in a relatively high per capita consumption of energy. Manufacturing consumes a large amount of power, which is, mainly produced by burning fossil fuels â coal, oil and gas â resulting in emissions. We are already shifting to green energy like solar and wind. There is a need to develop a digital economy, high-tech industries, and restructure industries to curb fossil fuels, boost low-carbon energy, and develop new and renewable energy sectors to bring down emission levels.Is there a timeline for reduction in the use of fossil fuels, especially coal? The share of coal in primary energy consumption has declined to nearly 57 percent, and non-fossil energy has exceeded 15 percent. Thus, by 2050, non-fossil energy may account for more than 90 percent of the total power generation. Only in this way can we make it possible to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060; under such a scenario, national five-year-plans become crucial. Thus, the 14th five-year plan could be vital to knowing the path our policymakers are paving to meet carbon neutrality and ensure economic growth.Which key sectors would have to reduce their emissions drastically?The power industry is the largest carbon emitter, accounting for about 40 percent of the nation's total emissions. Among the energy-intensive sectors, including iron and steel, cement, and building materials, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, and manufacturing, are directly or indirectly responsible for about 45 percent of the total national emissions. In addition to reducing final demand through a circular economy, these industries will have to adopt smart technologies and cleaner fuel to reduce their carbon footprint. We think that the power industry should take the lead and become the first one to decarbonize. How will the coronavirus pandemic impact China's plan to become carbon neutral?There is a Chinese proverbäººæ è¿è, å¿æè¿å¿§, which means, those who do not plan for the future will soon find trouble at their doorstep.Carbon neutrality is a long-term plan that will eventually help in preventing pandemics in the future. Moreover, biodiversity loss because of climate change could be strongly linked to viral outbreaks. The world will tide over the COVID-19 but preventing global temperature rise beyond 1.5-2 degrees Celsius would have many benefits, including reducing extreme weather events like wildfires, typhoons and floods. The current pandemic helps us to prepare for the commitments made during the Paris Climate Change Agreement.Apart from controlling industrial emissions, what else should be done to meet carbon neutrality?  We will also have to strengthen forestry, land use, and agriculture, which absorb carbon dioxide and boost biodiversity. At present, China has the world's largest planted forest and along with agriculture, wetlands, grasslands, and effective land use, it helps absorb about 800 million tons of carbon dioxide. This sector can help create green jobs and bring people closer to nature. What will be the impact of China's decision to go carbon neutral on the annual Climate Change Summit in Glasgow next year? We believe that President Xi Jinping's announcement would motivate other countries to strengthen their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce their emissions and boost the morale of the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. China is taking a responsible role in international and global governance and leading global efforts to fulfill the Paris Climate Agreement, sustainable development and economic recovery.He Jiankun is vice director, National Expert Committee on Climate Change and Academic Chair of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development, Tsinghua UniversityLi Zheng, is executive vice president of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development and Director of the Laboratory of Low Carbon Energy, Tsinghua UniversityVideo Editors: Oscar Margain, Gong Zhe(Cover: The City skyline is seen amid smog ahead of Chinese Lunar New Year in Beijing, China February 13, 2018. /Reuters)In a surprise announcement, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would become a carbon-neutral country by 2060 during his virtual address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) last month.

Enthusiasts around the world have praised the fermented tea for some of its possible health benefits. CGTN's Nick Mudimba visited a kombucha maker based on the outskirts of Nairobi and brings us this report.It's said you are what you eat. Many Kenyans have been turning to healthier diets and working out to stay in shape. Away from the world of sugary sodas and chemical preservatives, Andrew Wachira is making and selling an alternative beverage.Andrew Wachira, Founder, Kombucha Kenya says: "Kombucha is tea that is fermented and is fermented by good bacteria, we also call them probiotics, and good bacteria will act on the sweetened tea and for seven days or so it will turn out into this drink we call Kombucha."The drink is said to also contain antioxidants which can kill harmful bacteria and boost the immune system.The ingredients Wachira uses to make kombucha include tea bags, sugar, culture or SCOBY an acronym that means Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast, a starter liquid of a small amount of kombucha that has been brewed from a previous batch.He adds, "Steep the tea bags into hot water, steep it for a couple of minutes and thereafter you can add sugar, you can even add sugar while the tea is hot, the sugar can be more soluble in the tea and afterwards you now have to put it into the container that you are going to brew it â¦ Once you put the sweetened tea into the fermentation bucket or the container all you need to do is to add more water so that it can take the temperature down to room temperature, after that we now add the starter liquid and the scoby, the starter liquid comes first you give it a good stir and thereafter you add the scoby and you place it on top of that brew and you cover it."The tea which comes in many flavours is left to ferment for two or three weeks. Many of Wachira's clients come to him directly to pick up their supply.With nutritionists warning of the health risks associated with sweetened fizzy drinks like sodas, demand is moving towards healthier beverages like Kombucha - and Wachira says it's the health benefits that keep his clients coming back for more. Kombucha has been gaining popularity in Kenya.

Another 67,000 customers in Texas were without power, while Mississippi reported almost 34,000 outages.About 15,000 were without power in Georgia and South Carolina, where Delta was expected to dump rain Sunday before moving up the East Coast.The storm still had 30 mph winds early Sunday, though it was expected to weaken significantly by early Monday, according to the National Weather Service.Northeast Georgia and the western portion of Virginia and the Carolinas could see up to 6 inches of rain, creating flash flooding risks across the region, the weather service said. The Central Appalachians and southern New Jersey could get drenched as well, forecasters said.Tornadoes are possible across the Carolinas on Sunday, the weather service said. Flash flooding is possible from north Georgia to southern Virginia.Five tornadoes were reported in the Atlanta metro area. In Covington, east of Atlanta, a suspected tornado left one person with minor injuries and damaged a homeless shelter, displacing 30 people, the city's emergency management director, Jody Nolan, told CNN."Even if it wasn't quite as powerful as Hurricane Laura it was much bigger," Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday. "Obviously, this was a very serious, very large and powerful storm that produced significant amounts of damage."(With input from agencies)At least half a million households and businesses were in the dark on Sunday morning after Hurricane Delta, which hit Louisiana, weakened to a post-tropical cyclone and headed across the Southeast.Most of the customers without electricity, about 360,000 of them, were in Louisiana, where the hurricane made landfall Friday, according to poweroutage.us.

Job losses, illness, financial difficulties, and even some people's fear of contracting the virus from pets, led to a rise in animal abandonments in the UK. When people were furloughed or working from home, the adoption rate went up. During the first week of lockdown Battersea Dogs and Cats Home reported 86 dogs and 69 cats were rehomed, rising from 42 and 29 respectively in the same period last year.While this might look like a positive trend, and these animals went to good homes, it is too early to say that lockdown united all abandoned animals across the UK with new owners for the long term. When people go back to work their priorities change and newly-adopted pets can be at risk of ending up in a shelter because of the lack of time and commitment from their owners. Compared with the same period last year, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) charity received four times more calls from prospective owners when the UK went into lockdown â but now the organization has been receiving calls from those who want to return their new pets.  "People have gone back to work and then suddenly realized that this puppy doesn't fit into their life any more," says Herchran Boal, an RSPCA inspector in the West Midlands. "It's almost as if they didn't think about that. And that's very sad because a pet is for life, it's not just for the lockdown period."During the first three months of the lockdown the RSPCA received almost 3,500 calls â 40 a day â about abandoned animals, including 1,509 dogs, 1,165 cats, 299 small animals such as hamsters and guinea pigs and 275 exotic animals. The closure of RSPCA centers, shortage of staff and a surge of abandoned animals put the charity in a very difficult position. "I've been an inspector for 20 years and this is the worst that anything has affected the RSPCA," says Boal. "We have a service that was being provided for 24 hours a day but due to the pandemic we've had to close our control centers overnight. We have always been an organization that's gone on 24/7 because animals don't get sick just nine to five. People need us all the time."As a charity, the RSPCA relies on public donations â but fundraising events had to be stopped and the donations from the public have slowed down due to the COVID-19 crisis. "The NHS have done an amazing job and they're really great," says Boal. "But let's not forget the animals. The animals are what keep some people going, really. The pets are very important to them."Video editing: Riaz JugonThe COVID-19 crisis not only transformed our lives, it also had an impact on the welfare of animals.

Even after they die, they stand strong for another thousand years. And when they collapse, they don't decompose for an additional thousand years.Diversifolious in Latin means varied-leaved. The shape of the leaves changes with time. Younger trees have narrow leaves so they don't need too much water to grow. Full-fledged trees have rounder and bigger leaves to gravitate more sunlight.Rose willow can often be found around these poplars. Locals call rose willow and diversifolious poplar "couple plants" of the desert.In addition, these poplars provide durable and sturdy building material. The region's forebearers not only built houses with poplar but also carved out utensils from its wood.The poplar forest has become a popular sight inside the Taklamakan Desert - China's largest and the world's second largest drifting desert.(CGTN's Chen Bo also contributed to this piece with his underwater footage.)China is home to a unique type of poplar tree that can survive in the desert for centuries.Over half of the world's population of the trees live there and 90 percent of these are in the country's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.Situated in southern Xinjiang's Luntai County, Bayingol Mongolian Autonomous Prefecture is home to one of the world's largest forests made up of diversifolious poplar trees.Despite growing out of the desert, locals say the trees can live for one thousand years.

They have eliminated agricultural export subsidies, enhanced market access for cotton and cotton by-product exports from LDCs and worked to enable developing countries to benefit more from every step of the cotton value chain. Nevertheless, it is widely believed that more can be done to level the playing field for cotton producers, especially in LDCs.The annual World Cotton Day celebrations are an opportunity to recognize the importance of this global commodity â and to push forward with positive economic, development and sustainable trade policies.For the 2020 edition, the WTO has established a dedicated webpage that brings together contributions from ministers, ambassadors, heads of organizations and the private sector on the importance of cotton and the relevance of World Cotton Day to their respective countries and organizations.  The WTO has also set up a stand in its headquarters to celebrate cotton, with the distribution of souvenirs and information on cotton to staff and delegates.The importance of cotton to Cotton-4 countriesCotton production is the source of livelihood to over 4 million farmers in Africa, of which around 1 million are located in the Cotton-4 countries.For the Cotton-4 countries, cotton earnings represent between 8 to 12% of their annual Gross Domestic Production (GDP) and account for up to 40% of their total export revenue.Current world cotton production is above 26 million tonnes from which more than 8 million tonnes are traded globally every year.The Cotton-4 countries export approximately 800,000 tonnes of cotton per year, totalling around 10% of the total world cotton exports.(With input from World Trade Organization)The spotlight was shone on the importance of cotton for millions of farmers, processors and traders globally as the  World Trade Organization marked the first anniversary of World Cotton Day.The Cotton-4 group (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali) initiated the cotton sectoral initiative at the WTO with the aim of improving the global trade rules as they relate to cotton, and to shed light on the many linkages among trade, cotton and development.World Cotton Day aims to highlight the numerous gains enabled by international trade in cotton, including: selling to consumers abroad; increasing foreign exchange earnings; attracting investment in local businesses; employing more workers; and fostering growth and technology transfer in the wider economy.While widely appreciated as a fibre used to make textiles and clothes, cotton is also used in the production of edible oils, animal feed and fuel. Cotton production, processing, and trade represent a key source of income for a number of economies worldwide.In many African least developed countries (LDCs), cotton is key to job creation and economic stability.At the WTO, members have taken meaningful steps to promote cotton trade.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

Much of the continent saw above average temperatures for September, especially southeastern Europe.Western Europe also experienced bursts of record-breaking heatwaves last month, with temperatures reaching unusually high levels.The northern French city of Lille in mid-September had its hottest September day since records began in 1945, while cities in Germany and the UK experienced the highest September temperatures in four years.In Russia, according to the state weather service, last month was the country's hottest September in the 130 years since records began.  The Russian Hydrometeorology Center said almost every part of the country had experienced temperatures that were several degrees above average, with the largest anomalies of temperatures exceeding the average by five to six degrees Celsius observed in north Eurasia near the Arctic Circle.C3S scientists also found that in the Siberian Arctic, temperatures continued to be warmer than average in September, continuing a heatwave that affected different parts of the vast region since early spring."Although Siberia and the Arctic have large temperature fluctuations from year to year, the relative warmth observed this year has been unusual in its magnitude and persistence," Copernicus said in a statement. Melting Arctic sea iceAlongside the increasing temperatures in the Arctic, C3S also confirmed that sea ice levels have been melting and are in decline. The figures show that the average Arctic sea ice extent for September was the second lowest recorded, after September 2012.  Sea ice extent in the Arctic has declined noticeably since 1979 when satellite observations began. The trend can be seen throughout the year, but especially in September when the ice cover reaches its minimum extent for the year before starting to build up again."In 2020, there was an unusually rapid decline in Arctic sea ice extent during June and July, in the same region where above average temperatures were recorded, preconditioning the sea ice minimum to be particularly low this year," Carlo Buontempo, Director of Copernicus Climate Change Service said."The combination of record temperatures and low Arctic sea ice in 2020 highlight the importance of improved and more comprehensive monitoring in a region warming faster than anywhere else in the world," he added. Globally, September 2020 was 0.05 degrees Celsius warmer than the same month last year â which had been the warmest on record, according to scientists from Copernicus.In addition, temperatures in the Siberian Arctic continue to be much above average and Arctic sea ice is at its second lowest extent since satellite records began.  Temperatures in September were well above average in many regions across the globe, including off the coast of northern Siberia, and many parts of Europe, with many countries experiencing their warmest September on record.The numbers analyzed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service show that the month was 0.63 degrees Celsius above the average September temperatures of the standard thirty-year climatological reference period (1981-2010).This means that as well as being warmer than last year, this September was also 0.8 degrees Celsius warmer than September 2016, the second-warmest on record.  Europe's September heatwavesAcross Europe, September average temperatures reached a record high, about 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous warmest September of 2018.

The downpours have destroyed houses and washed away roads on the border between the two countries near Nice.These storms have been attributed to climate change and scientists believe they're likely to increase in frequency and volume in the years ahead â but hope natural interventions could dramatically reduce their impact. CLICK: HOW THE EDUCATION SECTOR IS ADAPTING TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS  The results of the study showed that in areas where new woodlands have been planted, the ability of soil to absorb water was almost double that of areas with no trees.This means that huge quantities of rainwater could be more readily absorbed by trees, rather than it simply running over the surface and into rivers where it subsequently causes severe flooding.The study's authors say their findings show the planting of more woodlands in upland areas could be an effective and natural flood management tool.Thomas Murphy, who led the research as part of his PhD, said: "Many UK upland areas have a history of soil compaction and the aim of our study was to define how quickly this nature-based solution could affect that."  He added: "People perhaps think that trees need to be mature in order for them to have beneficial environmental effects. But across our four test sites, we showed they can make significant improvements to soil properties within just 15 years of establishment, meaning it can be a viable option for flood prevention in a relatively modest time frame."This nature-based solution could be extremely timely, given the commitment of the UK government to plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 and other environmental schemes designed to enhance carbon retention, biodiversity and flood prevention. But scientists have warned that new woodlands will require careful placement if the benefits are to be maximized. The research concluded that that steep hillsides on the edge of upland areas provide the most effective location for tree plantations to serve as an effective flood-prevention tool.  Planting new woodlands in upland areas could help bring an end to flash flooding in the UK within 15 years, according to a new study published by the University of Plymouth. The UK is just one of several European countries to have been hit by serious flooding in recent years, prompting  research into how trees could be used to absorb rainwater.In February, large parts of the English Midlands and Yorkshire were left submerged in water after Storm Dennis hit the UK, resulting in serious damage to local communities and several deaths.Storm Alex also caused nearly a year's rainfall to come down on France and Italy in the space of just 12 hours this week.

Some of the animals, such as sheep, have not yet been studied with infection tests, so this does not confirm the species can indeed be infected.Lead author Christine Orengo, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "We wanted to look beyond just the animals that had been studied experimentally, to see which animals might be at risk of infection and would warrant further investigation and possible monitoring."The animals we identified may be at risk of outbreaks that could threaten endangered species or harm the livelihoods of farmers. The animals might also act as reservoirs of the virus, with the potential to reinfect humans later on, as has been documented on mink farms."The research team also performed more detailed structural analyses for certain animals, to gain a better understanding of how infection risks may differ across animal species. By comparing their findings to other experimental data, they set thresholds to predict which animals are at risk of infection, and which ones most likely cannot be infected.They found that most birds, fish, and reptiles do not appear to be at risk of infection, but the majority of the mammals they reviewed could potentially be infected.Orengo added: "The details of host infection and severity of response are more complex than just the interactions of the spike protein with ACE2, so our research is continuing to explore interactions involving other host virus proteins."  The team's findings mostly agree with experiments conducted in living animals and with reported cases of infections. They predict possible infection in domestic cats, dogs, mink, lions, and tigers, all of which have had reported cases, as well as ferrets and macaques, which have been infected in laboratory studies.First author, Su Datt Lam, who specializes in structural and molecular biology at UCL and the National University of Malaysia, said: "Unlike laboratory-based experiments, the computational analyses we devised can be run automatically and rapidly. Therefore, these methods could be applied easily to future virus outbreaks that, unfortunately, are becoming more common due to human encroachment into natural habitats."  Co-author Joanne Santini, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "To protect animals, as well as to protect ourselves from the risk of one day catching COVID-19 from an infected animal, we need large-scale surveillance of animals, particularly pets and farm animals, to catch cases or clusters early on while they're still manageable."It may also be important to employ hygiene measures when dealing with animals, similar to the behaviours we've all been learning this year to reduce transmission and for infected people to isolate from animals as well as from other people." Numerous animals may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to a large study modeling how the virus might infect different species' cells.The study, published in Scientific Reports and led by researchers at University College London (UCL) reports evidence that 26 animals regularly in contact with people may be susceptible to infection.The researchers investigated how the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 could interact with the ACE2 protein it attaches to when it infects people.The focus of the investigation was whether mutations in the ACE2 protein in 215 different animals, which make it different from the human version, would reduce the stability of the binding complex between the virus protein and host protein. Binding to the protein enables the virus to gain entry into host cells; while it is possible the virus might be able to infect animals via another pathway, it is unlikely based on current evidence that the virus could infect an animal if it cannot form a stable binding complex with ACE2.  The researchers found that for some animals, such as sheep and great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos, many of which are endangered in the wild), the proteins would be able to bind together just as strongly as they do when the virus infects people.

Kamchatka's Environment Ministry said that ships passing through the local bay may be at fault.(All photos via CFP.)(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Jianhu Lake, meaning "sword lake," is a plateau lake and wetland in southwest China's Yunnan Province.

French authorities said at least eight people were missing, including two firemen whose vehicle was carried away by a swollen river, according to local witnesses.  Army and helicopters join the effortThe French army and hundreds of rescuers were deployed to search for the missing, including using helicopters to transport aid and evacuate people where possible. An emergency services spokesman in France said that around 40 people stranded on roads by the landslides had sheltered in an old train station and then been airlifted to safety.The storm ravaged several villages around the city of Nice on the French Riviera. Nice mayor Christian Estrosi called it the worst flooding disaster in the area for more than a century, after flying over the area by helicopter. "The roads and about 100 houses were swept away or partially destroyed," he told French news channel BFM."I do not hide from you our deep concern about the final outcome of this episode," said prime minister Jean Castex, adding "I have been particularly shocked by what I saw today." Amid concerns that the death toll could rise, Castex said that the government had triggered its emergency plan for handling natural disasters.  In Breil-sur-Roya, a French village close to the Italian border, houses were buried in mud and turned-over cars stuck in the riverbed. Rescue efforts were concentrated on the Roya valley where roughly 1,000 firefighters, backed by helicopters and the army, resumed their search for survivors and helped people whose homes were destroyed or inaccessible.Eric Ciotti, a member of French parliament who is from one of the worst affected villages in the area, Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie, said several villages were cut off in the mountainous region's steep-sided valleys. "The situation is catastrophic in some communes," Ciotti said.Meteo France said that 500 millimeters of rain was registered over 24 hours in Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie, with close to 400 millimeters falling in several other towns â the equivalent of more than three months of rain at this time of the year.Authorities in the southern Alpes-Maritimes region had been placed on alert Friday and around 12,000 people in three valleys to the north of Nice were without power early Saturday afternoon. France has now declared the region a natural disaster zone. Houses 'perched above the void'Roads had been washed away by the waters leaving buildings teetering above the voids. "You can also see a few houses that are perched above the void because the riverbed has washed away the road," said a fire brigade spokesman."We have actually had houses wiped out," said Alpes-Maritimes prefect Bernard Gonzalez. "What we are going through is extraordinary.""My three-story house, it's in the river," said villager Sandra Dzidt, 62, who had to flee the floods dressed only in her nightgown. "All I have left is a tiny piece of wall and a door."  "We are thunderstruck. We saw the (river) Vesubie burst its banks â everything was swept away, including part of the old iron bridge," said Serge Franco, a resident of the Alpes-Maritimes village Roquebilliere."My house is habitable but half of my land has been swept away," said another resident, Guillaume Andre, who was evacuated overnight but returned to see the devastation after daybreak."I lost everything but we are alive," said Roquebilliere resident Jennyfer. "There must be one room left in my house.""The firefighters did not have enough rope, and even with our rope we could not reach the house, so it was too late to get to them and the house was suddenly swept away," added resident Patrick Theus.Gonzalez called on the families of the missing not to give up hope. "Just because their loved ones haven't been able to get in touch doesn't mean that they have been taken by the storm," he said. Many landline and some mobile phone services were disrupted, with some villages using satellite phones to communicate with rescue services.Despite forecasts of more rain, Gonzalez insisted that rescue efforts were to continue throughout Sunday. "The helicopter procession will continue all day long," he said.  Director of civil protection JÃ©rÃ©my Crunchant said there was heavier rainfall than on 3 October 2015, when floods caused the death of 20 people in and around the French Riviera city of Cannes.The presidents of Italy's Piedmont and Liguria regions signed a joint letter calling on the government to declare a state of emergency with several villages cut off. The mayor of the northern Italian city of Ventimiglia, Gaetano Scullino, said "a disaster of this kind has not happened since 1958."Cirio added Italy was already struggling to cope with the effects of the coronavirus which has left some 36,000 dead and shattered the economy over the past six months."We are already in an extraordinary situation," he said. "Because of the pandemic the region will this year receive 200 million euros ($234 million) less in tax receipts. If the state does not intervene we shall not recover."Meanwhile in Venice, a long-delayed flood barrier system including a network of 78 artificial dykes successfully protected the lagoon city from a high tide for the first time on Saturday, bringing huge relief following years of repeated inundations. Storm Alex has left at least three people dead and eight missing in southern France and northern Italy, bringing record rainfall in places and causing heavy flooding that swept away roads, damaged homes and left thousands without power.In Italy, at least two people died â a volunteer firefighter in the Aosta Valley and a man whose car was swept into the River Sesia in northern Italy after a road subsided.The water level in the River Po jumped by three meters in just 24 hours and officials in the Piedmont region reported a record 630 millimeters of rain in just 24 hours in Sambughetto, close to Italy's border with Switzerland. Dozens of firefighters were trying to reach one village by train after the road was shut, while neighboring Switzerland was also battered with record rainfall and powerful gusts, forcing the closure of roads and mountains. CLICK: THE CREWLESS, SOLAR-POWERED 'MAYFLOWER' MAKING THE SAME JOURNEY AS ITS HISTORIC NAMESAKE France suffered its first fatality on Sunday, a shepherd whose body was pulled from a river near the border.

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

When one enters through the gates, one will quickly notice a serene environment, lush bushes, and trees with birds perching here and there.The sanctuary hosts a large number of free grazing impalas, the rare Sitatunga antelope, Zebras, and the vervet monkeys.The caged animals include lions, leopards, buffalo, Ostrich, guinea fowls, and the baboons.This sanctuary is one of three in Kenya that was established to protect and rehabilitate wild animals as well as educate the public on wildlife conservation efforts. Others are the Nairobi Safari Walk and the Nairobi orphanage.Paul Omondi, the warden in charge of the Sanctuary says: "The reason why we have the orphanage and the safari walk and the impala sanctuary is that it is a refuge for the rescued wildlife, probably from human-wildlife conflict or problematic animals, the injured, and the orphaned. So the sanctuary is a way of offering them a home.âHere, unlike in the national parks, one will have a rare opportunity of seeing some of the animals up-close. The sanctuary is home to hundreds of impalas which boasts of the largest population followed by the Zebras.While taking a walk through the sanctuary, we observed herds of these herbivores which were busy grazing in the morning hours taking advantage of the cool breeze on the shores of the lake.Kisumu sun can be unforgiving, and it is based on this that Mr. Omondi encourages those who are interested in interacting with the animals as they feed, to always make it to the sanctuary in the morning before they retreat into the bushes away from the scorching sun."In terms of conservation fees for entry into the sanctuary, we charge adults Kenyans, Ksh. 200/$2 while children pay Ksh. 100/$1. For non-residents, we charge Ksh.2000/$20 and children Ksh.1500/$15." said Omondi.The low seasons for tourists both local and international are between January and April. The peak season runs between July and August while the high season remains to be September and December.However this year, the Sanctuary saw reduced numbers of visitors due to restrictions that were put in place by health authorities in an effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic spread.Lifespan in the cages vis a vis the wildLife in the wild is tough coupled with a rough terrain where only those who are swift survive.But as CGTN's Halligan Agade discovered, animals in this sanctuary seem to be enjoying life to the fullest because they are accessed to food and treatment unlike their counterparts in the wild.No wonder then Mr. Omondi submits that those in the wild have a shorter lifespan as compared to the caged ones, with the big cats for instance the lion likely to live up to 15 years even more in the cage."In the wild you know it is survival for the fittest but under captive management, the animals within the sanctuary tend to live longer because they are looked after, they are fed and treated."But there is another danger lurking in the shadows for these caged animals. Obesity. Just like humans, if caution is not taken, the Warden says, some animals especially the carnivores can be obese and this calls for the services of a veterinary expert to keep monitoring them since they do not run after their prey which is a form of exercise. This natural activity is only available in the wild."In terms of the feeding program, we're guided by our Veterinary team who come to inspect the animals on a monthly basis just to check the condition of the sanctuary, condition of the animals, the feeding regime, and the treatment regime."Controlled breedingBut it is not just obesity that is to be considered for the big cats, but the uncontrolled numbers of the herbivores like the Impalas must also be in check to control inbreeding to conserve a generation to make sure it does not face extinction arising from impure breeds."When we have a lot of animals like the impalas, we trans-locate them to Ndeere Island National Park. This is done in consultation with the species and research department in Nairobi. This is done to reduce the numbers and also give the excess numbers new habitat or new homes and also as a way of reducing inbreeding among the impalas that we have within the sanctuary."Interestingly, it is only the herbivores that can be translocated to the wild, however, for the carnivores, it doesn't happen."In captive management, in terms of the wild, it is a bit different for the lions that are under captive management. They are under cages, and they are fed. When you take them to the wild, they will have to fend for themselves and this is a habit they will have to learn. This poses a great danger to them in terms of survival and also existence." Omondi adds.But thanks to this sanctuary the endangered animals now have a place to call home.Free-ranging and captive animals are not the only attraction here, but bird-life, indigenous forest, swampy papyrus areas, grassland, rocky view area, nature trails, and sundowner viewpoint is also on the card for nature lovers.Set on the shore of Lake Victoria, the Kisumu Impala Sanctuary is just a ten minutes drive from the city center.

Just like humans, if caution is not taken, the Warden says, some animals especially the carnivores can be obese and this calls for the services of a veterinary expert to keep monitoring them since they do not run after their prey which is a form of exercise. This natural activity is only available in the wild."In terms of the feeding program, we're guided by our Veterinary team who come to inspect the animals on a monthly basis just to check the condition of the sanctuary, condition of the animals, the feeding regime, and the treatment regime."Controlled breedingBut it is not just obesity that is to be considered for the big cats, but the uncontrolled numbers of the herbivores like the Impalas must also be in check to control inbreeding to conserve a generation to make sure it does not face extinction arising from impure breeds."When we have a lot of animals like the impalas, we trans-locate them to Ndeere Island National Park. This is done in consultation with the species and research department in Nairobi. This is done to reduce the numbers and also give the excess numbers new habitat or new homes and also as a way of reducing inbreeding among the impalas that we have within the sanctuary."Interestingly, it is only the herbivores that can be translocated to the wild, however, for the carnivores, it doesn't happen."In captive management, in terms of the wild, it is a bit different for the lions that are under captive management. They are under cages, and they are fed. When you take them to the wild, they will have to fend for themselves and this is a habit they will have to learn. This poses a great danger to them in terms of survival and also existence." Omondi adds.But thanks to this sanctuary the endangered animals now have a place to call home.Free-ranging and captive animals are not the only attraction here, but bird-life, indigenous forest, swampy papyrus areas, grassland, rocky view area, nature trails, and sundowner viewpoint is also on the card for nature lovers.Archeologists in Egypt announced on Saturday that they had discovered at least 59 ancient coffins in a vast necropolis south of the country's capital Cairo, one containing the pristine mummy of an ancient priest. This is than 2,600 years since they were buried. The ornate sarcophagi have remained unopened since they were entombed near the famed Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara, according to Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.Footage shared by the ministry showed colorful sarcophagi decorated with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics. Other artifacts and at least 28 statues were found in the two deep wells, the ministry said.A sealed door was also unearthed where it is expected more mummies may lie behind, said Khaled el-Anany the first Minister of Antiquities and Tourism, adding that the artifacts were in an excellent state of preservation and would be displayed in the Grand Egyptian museum next year.Mostafa Waziri, the general director of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told NBC News that the discovery reminded him of the tomb of King Tutankhamun, because both had been discovered almost intact.The Saqqara plateau is part of the necropolis of Egypt's ancient city of Memphis.

Virtually all the damage has been done since mid-August, when five of the six largest fires in state history erupted. Lightning strikes caused some of the most devastating blazes.Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said wildfires have scorched 3.9 million acres in California since Aug. 15. That figure, which works out to over 6,000 square miles (15,500 square kilometers), is astonishing even in a state that has had its fair share of fires."It's likely that over the next day or two we will crest the 4-million-acre mark. The biggest year before this year was 1.54 million," Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said. "We are dwarfing that previous record and we have a lot of season left to go."Fire officials said the Glass Fire had first priority. Since erupting last Sunday, the fire has destroyed nearly 600 buildings, including 220 homes and nearly the same number of commercial structures.Some 80,000 people were under evacuation orders, which were expanded on Thursday.Four million acres have been burned this year by wildfires and leaving behind a trail of death of 30 people and incinerated hundreds of homes in what is already the worst fire season on record in California.The fires have torched an area larger than Connecticut and fire crews at a blaze in the northern wine country were on high alert as forecasters warned of red flag conditions of extreme fire danger into Saturday morning.Winds up to 30 mph (48 kph) were forecast to push through the hills in Napa and Sonoma counties as the Glass Fire, exploded in size earlier in the week, continued to threaten more than 28,000 homes and other buildings."It's a time of nervousness," said Paul Gullixon, a spokesman for Sonoma County.Winds were blowing at higher elevations on the western side of the fire and crews expected a long battle to keep flames from jumping containment lines and spot fires from leaping ahead to spark new blazes."It's going to be a big firefight for us over the next 36 hours," said Billy See, an assistant chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.More crews and equipment were deployed in and around Calistoga, a town of 5,000 people known for hot springs, mud baths and wineries in the hills of Napa County about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of San Francisco.The area was also experiencing high temperatures and thick smoke that fouled the air throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.Around the state, 17,000 firefighters were battling nearly two dozen major blazes.

caused unprecedented rainfall and flooding in others.Africa's largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria is one such example.Water levels in the lake are at unprecedented heights due to more than a year of heavy rains in the East African region.According to Eastern Africa Consortium for Clinical Research, the current rise in the lake began on 1st October 2019 and significantly went up from 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020. It was a 1.32 meters rise attained in only 6 months before hitting an all-time high of 13.42-meter mark by September this year.However, heavy rain isn't the only thing fueling Lake Victoria's rising levels. Environmental degradation, urbanization, and other human activity all play a part.Dr. Raymond Omollo the Director at Lake Basin Development Authority says that development is good for humanity, but it can also change the ecosystem."On the Ugandan side, there has been a huge hydro-project, so again that limits the amount of water that is flowing out of the lake at any given time. With this, you have the backflow so then you do not release as much water as you would ordinarily," Dr. Omollo says.The Kenyan government is also constructing dams to help manage the flow of water to the lake. Authorities have embarked on afforestation programs to help water catchment areas to reduce soil erosion.Human activities along the shores of the lake have also impacted the massive lake especially deforestation and agricultural activities.Officials say that there must be a concerted effort to target these activities and make sure that they are controlled to save the lake."In order for us to manage this easily, firstly we must target the areas where people do agriculture because that's where land has been opened up. Cultivation has been done and any little rain will wash away the topsoil, get it into the river, and from there, it will go settling," Ken K'oyoo the Director of the Environment in Kisumu County explains.People close to the lake are being advised to relocate to other areas. Officials worry the lake might continue to swell and displace more people who have lived along its shores for over a half a century now."When you drive along the lake, there are huge investments whether in the hospitality industry and when the water levels rise, a number of facilities in Kisumu were not usable, because they were partly submerged," Dr. Omollo adds.Climate change has become one of the main agendas of the United Nations Environment-UNEP with the clarion call that global citizens must unite to reduce its impact. The changing weather patterns have without a doubt resulted in many natural disasters across the world and loss of lives."It is a pointer to the fact that climate change is real and unless we are able to make our voices heard and do something about its impact, then very soon we would probably lose a lot of livelihoods and the beautiful lake, the resource that we have might end up being a curse rather than a blessing," Dr. Omollo says.Climate change has not only led to drought, wildfires, and ice melting in some parts of the globe, but it has also caused unprecedented rainfall and flooding in others.Africa's largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria is one such example.Water levels in the lake are at unprecedented heights due to more than a year of heavy rains in the East African region.According to Eastern Africa Consortium for Clinical Research, the current rise in the lake began on 1st October 2019 and significantly went up from 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020. It was a 1.32 meters rise attained in only 6 months before hitting an all-time high of 13.42-meter mark by September this year.However, heavy rain isn't the only thing fueling Lake Victoria's rising levels. Environmental degradation, urbanization, and other human activity all play a part.Dr. Raymond Omollo the Director at Lake Basin Development Authority says that development is good for humanity, but it can also change the ecosystem."On the Ugandan side, there has been a huge hydro-project, so again that limits the amount of water that is flowing out of the lake at any given time. With this, you have the backflow so then you do not release as much water as you would ordinarily," Dr. Omollo says.The Kenyan government is also constructing dams to help manage the flow of water to the lake. Authorities have embarked on afforestation programs to help water catchment areas to reduce soil erosion.Human activities along the shores of the lake have also impacted the massive lake especially deforestation and agricultural activities.Officials say that there must be a concerted effort to target these activities and make sure that they are controlled to save the lake."In order for us to manage this easily, firstly we must target the areas where people do agriculture because that's where land has been opened up. Cultivation has been done and any little rain will wash away the topsoil, get it into the river, and from there, it will go settling," Ken K'oyoo the Director of the Environment in Kisumu County explains.People close to the lake are being advised to relocate to other areas.

Through a tidy array of lights, the enormous natural power is seen pushing the waves forward and pounding against riverbanks harshly, as if countless of silver dragons were vigorously swimming.Under the background of light beams near the river, viewers can savor a skillful water painting created by nature.It looks like a landscape painting on water, but on a closer look, it also looks like a flowing music score that plays grandiose symphonies.According to local authorities, the scenic area has received more than 5,000 visitors within five days by October 1. The number of daily views is estimated to reach a peak on October 4, the 18th day of the eighth month on Chinese lunar calendar, when the tidal bores reach their most spectacular moment.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Jingjie)Now is the best time to admire the Tidal Bore of the Qiantang River, an annual natural spectacle, in east China's coastal city.The picturesque scene featuring magnificent tidal bores rushing under the luminous moon attracted crowds of locals and visitors in Haining City, Zhejiang Province on Thursday night.Since ancient times, the world-famous Qiantang Tidal Bore, which is created by the gravity from the moon and the rotation of the Earth, has been hailed as a "marvelous spectacle on earth."One of the world's largest tidal bores ushered in the best time of the year for sightseeing with the advent of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, coinciding with China's National Day.It has been a great tradition and local custom in the eastern province for over 2,000 years to enjoy the natural wonder and celebrate under the full moon around the festival, when the tidal waves become the biggest bores.The best vantage point for watching the amazing back-flow bore in Haining City made a big innovation this year to improve tourists' experience.Tourists flocking to the riversides can enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to not only hear but watch the amazing scene at night owing to the elaborately designed light beam arrays.The Qiantang Tidal Bore is also called "the Silver Dragon" by locals.

These measures, such as expediting legislation to protect biodiversity, drawing red lines for ecological protection, establishing a national park system, undertaking major projects for biodiversity protection, and coordinating and advancing biodiversity management will help the country to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and to ensure China's greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2030. He also called for multilateralism in protecting biodiversity.French President Emmanuel Macron stressed the need to step up the fight against environmental crime, and to put a definitive end to all illegal activities that endanger nature, destroy ecosystems, feed corruption, hinder the development of the rule of law and, ultimately undermine the sustainable development of humanity. He also called for the transformation of the current models of production, trade and consumption, as well as public investment to enable the transformation. He also said France will mobilize for the adoption of an ambitious new global strategic framework for the protection of biodiversity at next year's UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is striving to be a leader in protecting the environment, and surpassed its target of protecting 10 percent of marine areas by 2020. He pledged to protect 30 percent of land and oceans by 2030.While many countries have joined the UN in pledging to protect 30 percent of their land and seas by 2030, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro strongly opposed "international greed" towards the Amazon rainforest, and said that countries have the right to use their natural resources and "that is precisely what we intend to do with the huge wealth of resources found in the Brazilian territory."Our planet is facing severe threats from biodiversity loss and requires urgent attention and efforts to reverse the damage.

As well as providing a habitat for many marine species, it also captures carbon 35 times faster than a rainforest. But in recent years, fields of the plant have shrunk as a result of pollution, an influx in fishing and a rise in coastal development.  CLICK: FOR MORE STORIES FROM RAZOR, CGTN'S BRAND NEW SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWThe group of marine biologists from Swansea University, backed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Sky Ocean Rescue, has embarked on a $515,000 project named Project Seagrasses to restore the meadows to their previous state. RAZOR's Jo Colan joined the team of scientists in Dale Fort, Wales as they began the first ever seagrass restoration replanting in the UK. Richard Unsworth, one of the marine biologists in the team said: "Seagrasses have been decimated around the UK. We think that the UK has lost at least 90 percent of its seagrass. So it remains a scattered, fragmented habitat that used to be a very dominant part of the coast of the UK."Over the summer, the team collected more than 750,000 seeds from across the UK and then transported them back to the University's labs.The seeds were then washed and artificially vernalised (kept at a near-freezing temperature to mimic the winter season.) After that, the temperature was increased, allowing them to germinate, before they were put in bags and dropped into the sea.  They used the help of children from a local primary school to help fill the bags with seeds, with the hope it will help the next generation get a better understanding of the importance of the process."We came up with the idea of using a pretty simplistic little bag, the sort of hessian bag that your Christmas soap gets packed in and gets a little bow on it. Making sure they are nicely topped up with sand," Unsworth added, saying there are about 50 seeds in each bag.In around six months, the first seagrass shoots from the project are expected to emerge on the seabed."Well, we face a growing climate emergency and we have to make important rapid steps as a planet to fight that emergency. Seagrasses store vast amounts of carbon in their sediments. And they do that very, very rapidly so it can stay and remain locked away for millennia. We also face a biodiversity emergency, where all populations of all major animals and plants on this planet are in decline," Unsworth explained.Video editing: Natalia LuzA team of UK scientists has launched an "emergency" seagrass restoration project to try to revive the country's underwater meadows. World leaders are set to meet on Wednesday at a United Nations summit to discuss the "urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development" as it continues to be a growing global issue. Seagrass is the only flowering plant in the world that can pollinate underwater.

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report last year found nearly 1 million species are on the verge of extinction.The Living Planet Report prepared by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Zoological Society of London calculated global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish decline by an average two-third in less than half a century.In order to protect the global biodiversity, world leaders committed to 20 targets in 2010 during a meeting at Aichi in Japan. None of the 20 targets agreed on by the governments were able to be met, found a review of the 'Aichi Targets" released early this month. The summit will be an opportunity to demonstrate ambition to accelerate action on controlling and reversing the biodiversity loss, said the CBD.

"The reasons for this are unclear," they said. "Lots of factors could affect the changing of numbers of sea turtles sighted," said Zara Botterell of the University of Exeter and Plymouth Marine Laboratory. "Climate change, prey availability and environmental disasters such as the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill could all influence turtle numbers and behavior."The record shows a dramatic increase in the turtle sightings in the 1980s and 1990s, which researchers attribute to the rising public interest in conservation activities and a better reporting mechanism. Of the seven different sea turtle species, six of them â green, hawksbill, kemp's ridley, leatherback, loggerhead, and the olive ridley â are found in both warm and cold water oceans in many countries. But the flatback turtles reside only in Australia, Indonesia and Southern Papua New Guinea.In the UK and Ireland, leatherback sea turtles are regularly spotted, making up 1,683 of the 1,997 sightings since 1910. These turtles visit the country's ocean during the summer months to feast on jellyfish. The record shows spotting of 240 loggerheads, 61 Kemp's ridley turtles during winter months. These turtles might have been carried on currents and are stranded in cold waters. But only 11 green turtles, one hawksbill and one olive ridley sightings were found in the record. Most of the recorded sightings of turtles in the UK and Ireland were along western and southern coasts. Of the 1,997 turtles sighted, 143 were "bycatch" (caught accidentally) in fishing lines, nets and ropes â and the large majority of these were released alive.But researchers claim that the sea turtle populations in the North Atlantic are mostly stable or increasing. "The apparent decrease may represent reduced reporting rather than fewer turtles in our seas," said Botterell."One reason for this could be that fewer fishing boats are at sea now than in the past â and fishers are the most likely people to see and report turtles," she added. Concerned over the depleting population of sea turtles, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has already declared kemp's ridley, hawksbil and green sea turtles critically endangered, seeking the intervention of the governments.Leatherback, olive ridley, green and loggerhead turtles have been placed under the endangered list. There is not enough data available about flatback turtles.  "We have been lucky to analyze this unique dataset that exists because Britain and Ireland are a real hotbed of engaged citizen science, said Professor Brendan Godley, who leads the Exeter Marine research group.

Up till the end of last year, eight out of nine projected goals had been accomplished in terms of concentration of fine particles, carbon emissions, water quality and the elimination of other chemical pollutants, Zhao Yingmin, vice minister of ecology and environment, said.Zhao told a press conference on October 21 that the number of days with excellent or good air quality in 2020 is expected to reach 84.5% by the end of the year, comfortably meeting the goal as outlined in the plan.On top of that, China has also contributed significantly to tackling climate change by controlling carbon emissions, promoting energy conservation, boosting the development of green energy and actively participating in international governance. Carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP continues to decline and carbon intensity has decreased by 18.2% compared to 2015. Since 2010, sales of new energy cars have taken up 55 percent of the global figure, making China the country with the largest number of new energy vehicles in the world.Zhao said the achievement is the result of a continuously improved management system in the construction of ecological civilization and stronger laws and regulation. Having said that, challenges still remain. "Our industrial structure still relies heavily on the chemical industry, the energy industry still mainly relies on coal, and transportation is still highway-based," Zhao said. "Meanwhile, the world is undergoing profound and complex changes, the risks and challenges are growing every day, unilateralism and protectionism are on the rise. China's environmental protection is still an arduous task and the road ahead is long and tortuous.""We will continue our efforts in environmental protection and fighting against climate change based on the previous experiences in the next five years." (All photos via VCG. )(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)China experienced its greatest improvement in ecological and environmental protection from 2016 to 2020 after the completion of the main objectives and tasks outlined in the 13th Five-Year Plan, according to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment.This year is the last year of the plan in which more attention has been given to environmental protection â targets for cutting carbon emissions and optimizing energy use.

The iconic marsupials, with some of the strongest jaws on the planet, were recently released into a sprawling, biodiversity-rich reserve in New South Wales."They are on their own. There's no food, no shelter, monitoring takes place four times a year through a tracking system and process, but the devils are out there," said Aussie Ark president Tim Faulkner.It's not known what led to the end of the devils' existence on the mainland."It may have been a mix of Aboriginal hunting, a mix of people bringing dingoes from Southeast Asia into Australia, it also might have been a couple of climate snaps that reduced prey availability for devils and potentially even disease," said Rewilding Australia director Rob Brewster.The devils continued to thrive in Tasmania until the 1990's when a facial tumor disease wiped out about 90 percent of the wild population.That prompted conservation efforts to increase disease-free numbers.It also eventually led to a plan involving species recovery specialists Aussie Ark to bring healthy Tasmanian devils to a unique, fenced wildlife sanctuary in Barrington Tops. "It is the most northerly part of Antarctic beach forest and sub-alpine Montagne swamps in Australia. It is the most southerly distribution of subtropical rainforests," said Faulkner. "It got an elevation change from sea level to 1,400 meters above sea level and so it is a mixing pot and a melting pot of biodiversity. It is home to 15 percent of all vertebrate fauna in Australia.â Australia has lost more mammals to extinction than any other country in the world, which experts say is largely due to introduced predators such as foxes and feral cats. They are counting on the devils to play a vital role in protecting other endangered species. "The devil has a role and impact on feral pests and it maintains balance within an ecosystem. So to bring them back to the mainland, they present no threat to humans, they present no threat to livestock. It is very unique in terms of a top order predator, but what they do critically in the absence of any other solution is control and disrupt numbers and populations of the feral fox and the feral cat, which are almost singularly related to almost all of our mammal extinctions," said Faulkner.(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)After a 3,000-year absence, Tasmanian devils have made a return to Australia's mainland.

Thanks years of painstaking efforts, however, Qingyang has gradually brought the loss under control, Xinhua News Agency reported.The local water resources authority devised terraced fields and planted trees such as pines and sea buckthorn on slopes. At the bottom of the slopes, dams have been built to stop muddy water from flowing into the river.Data from the local soil and water conservation bureau showed the city lost about 98 million metric tonnes of soil last year, down by more than 40 percent from the average annual loss in the 1980s."Nevertheless, to maintain the declining trend nationwide, further efforts are needed, especially in areas severely hit by soil erosion such as Northeast and Southwest China and the Yangtze and Yellow river basins," the Ministry said. "Also, it is possible for areas that have been treated to revert into regions affected by soil erosion if results are not well maintained."A one-year campaign launched by the ministry last month targets illegal projects and activities that cause soil erosion in 71 cities and more than 450 counties in the Yellow River Basin. It will be followed by strict supervision measures."Theoretically, soil resources are renewable, but they will be drained under intense influence from human activities," stated the Ministry.Research by the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Geochemistry in 2006 found that it takes up to 3,000 years to form 1 centimeter of soil in parts of China with karst landforms, but that can be lost in just a few heavy rainstorms if not protected well.With nearly 30 percent of China's land currently affected by soil erosion, the ministry said there is an urgent need to minimize the depletion of soil because it causes harm to diversity and the economy, along with geological disasters and infrastructural damage.The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said last year that soil erosion may reduce global crop yields by up to 10 percent by 2050 â the equivalent of removing millions of hectares of land from crop production.The Ministry said it will step up efforts to slow down soil erosion and prevent environmental damage caused by development activities.(Original editor: Li Hongyang)(All images via CFP)(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)Further reduction of soil erosion in China is becoming increasingly difficult as the remaining affected areas â which have seen four decades of progress that have reduced the extent of the problem and its intensity â are "tougher and more complicated" to deal with, the Ministry of Water Resources has said.The latest data, released by the Ministry in August, said 2.71 million square kilometers of land experienced soil erosion last year, down by almost 1 percent from 2018 and 26 percent from the 1980s.The improvement was due to various water conservancy projects, including transforming slope farmland that is more likely to lose soil when it rains into a combination of terraced farmland, forests and grassland.For example, the Loess Plateau, located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River, remains one of the most severely eroded areas in China due to its hilly terrain and heavy summer rains.In the 1980s, about 10 percent of the soil that entered the Yellow River each year came from Qingyang, a city on the plateau in Gansu Province.

The Hamo Brothers are two Hani singers from Nanuo village in Yuanjiang County in southwest China's Yunnan Province. In the Hani language, "hamo" means twin. The Hamo Brothers are twin brothers who are dedicated to preserving their ethnic group's culture. They often visit the elderly in the village to collect stories and create songs based on the ancient melody of the Hani people. About the "Go!

And then potentially the chemistry of the river is damaged as well."Prior to the arrival of sewage, the Chess's riverbed was lined with minerals to create perfect conditions for fish and wildlife to thrive. It remains popular with fishermen and dog walkers and is a haven for brown trout, the endangered water vole and many other species â but everything that depends on it is under threat from pollution.  The sewage discharge is one key reason the River Chess failed chemical pollution tests, according to a recent UK government report by the Environment Agency. But data gathered from lakes, rivers and streams all across England over three years up paint a grim picture nationwide. Only 14 percent of rivers were found to have a "good ecological status" and none proved to be entirely pollution free. The report says population growth, land use and climate change are all contributing to the problem. "Obviously there is a widespread and endemic problem with pollution in our rivers," says Mark Lloyd, CEO of the Rivers Trust, an umbrella organization that works to protect UK rivers. "And really that's from two sources, principally â from sewage pollution and from agriculture. There's also a problem with urban pollution and run-off from roads. We have solved some of those gross pollution issues from the past, but we have new threats, we have new emerging chemicals, things like flame retardants and PCBs and things that are very persistent in the environment."Water companies were also criticized in a separate recent government report by the Environment Agency. Four out of nine companies failed to meet pollution standards. Many are struggling with outdated infrastructure, that no longer has the capacity for a growing population and more frequent extreme weather events. CLICK: CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY RESEARCHERS ARE DEVELOPING INTRICATELY FOLDED STRANDS OF DNAIn Ewell, in suburban Surrey, two large storm tanks are designed to divert their contents directly into the nearby Hogsmill river in the event of heavy rain. "Our system seems to routinely cause those overflows, because the system is so overloaded with the proliferation of hard surfaces and also population growth," says Lloyd."We're really asking our sewers to do a job they weren't designed for. And so, we need to design sewers fit for the future, including climate change. It's been designed around a system that is hundreds of years old. It combines surface water with foul sewage. That really does need to be completely reverse engineered."Thames Water, which operates the sewage storm tanks in Ewell and the water treatment works along the River Chess, says that in some cases sewage discharge is unavoidable."We work hard to minimize storm discharges, while also looking at how we can improve the system for the future, including reducing groundwater infiltration and increasing capacity," the company said in a statement. "We've also invested heavily in monitoring equipment to understand how frequently spills occur and help us plan improvements."  Along the River Chess, regular monitoring of pollution is done by volunteers, with the help of equipment loaned by Queen Mary University of London. Jennings believes the government should be helping more. "They're not looking at this as they should do and they're not protecting our rivers, as we believe they should do," he says. "So, we have to intervene and push the Environment Agency, push government, push the water companies to take action."The government says it is trying to tackle the problem. A spokesperson for the UK Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said: "The latest water classification results show we need to go further and faster to protect our water environment, in particular chalk streams like the River Chess. That's why we have set up a task force to set out clear proposals to reduce the frequency and volumes of sewage discharged by storm overflows."Whatever the solutions, they are likely to take time to implement and for real improvement to show.

"So, this isn't exactly something new, but it has escalated and become a lot more severe because of the pandemic and so what we are seeing is there has been a bit of backlash in terms of creating more negative attitudes towards bats."Following the outbreak of the deadly Nipah virus in Malaysia in 1998, which was transmitted from fruit bats to pigs and then to humans, most research in the country has focused on the flying fox and other bats' role as possible vectors of disease."I knew from research done in other countries that they actually played as very major and important role in maintaining the health of our tropical ecosystems," said Dr. Sheema, co-founder of Rimba, a non-profit group of scientists."At the same time, I found out that the flying foxes are disappearing very rapidly because of human activities, such as hunting and clearing forests and mangroves."They are not just hunted for food and medicine. Fruit farmers often kill them too."It just seemed like this was a very important issue that was being overlooked and ignored," Sheema said.Rimba's Project Pteropus â pteropus being the Latin name for the flying fox â aims to fill that knowledge gap.Hauling himself up a towering durian tree with rope pulley, a man sets up a camera to capture night time images of the bats' activities.Farmers of the much-prized durian fruit had long believed that the bats knocked the durian flowers off the tree, reducing their yields. In fact, the opposite is true."They're  playing this very important role in durian farms where they're helping to actually pollinate the durian flowers," Sheema said."Malaysia flying foxes play this unique dual role in a number of ecosystems, such as rainforests, mangroves, peat swamps, freshwater swamps. They're both seed dispersers and also pollinators. So, when they carry fruits away, they're actually helping to carry seeds away and helping to plant these seeds in other parts of the landscape, but then they're also visiting flowers to drink nectar as well, collecting pollen and then transferring the pollen somewhere else."Still, their furry canine-like faces have done little to endear them to fruit farmers."Fruit farmers have complained about flying foxes feeding on the fruit crops in the past, and they believe this necessitates eradicating the flying foxes."Project Pteropus has set out to research the role the flying fox bats play in the ecosystem to counter the negative perceptions â and the unnecessary killing. Rimba has produced posters and animated videos to reach out to the public and gone to the ground to educate farmers.Eric Chong runs an ecolodge and fruit orchard on the northern island of Penang."At my neighbor's farm, they are actually putting up nets to trap the bats, especially around their fruit trees," he said."When we first got the farm, our caretaker had advised us to leave the bats alone, they actually will help the farm, so we left the bats alone, not having much proof of actually what bats do."Then Rimba showed him the night camera video of the bats interacting with the durian flowers."When I saw that video of the bats pollinating the durian flowers, yeah, I was very convinced of their beneficial impact," Chong said.He believes other farmers would be too.But Rimba knows there's more than just misperception at work here. Flying foxes aren't dubbed fruit bats for no reason."We need to start investigating and trialling mitigation methods in partnership with the farmers so that we can look into ways that we can help protect the fruit crops from the bats without actually killing the bats," Sheema said.Rimba is also reaching out to educate the broader public too."Anyone who might be hunting or killing flying foxes, they actually need to stop this kind of practice because if the flying fox disappears from the ecosystem, if they disappear from Malaysia, they could be very negative impacts on all of us on our well-being, on the economy, on industries."As for fears about bats as spreaders of deadly disease, "All they need to do to avoid infection risk from bats is really to just leave bats alone, not to consume them, not to disturb them, not to kill them."(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)From a public relations standpoint, it's not a good time to be a bat â much less a member of the flying fox fruit bat species linked to the spread of COVID-19."Bats have always had this negative reputation in general," said Malaysian researcher Sheema Abdul Aziz.

The world is curious about how China will achieve this ambitious goal. Alok Gupta spoke to Professor Li Zheng and He Jiankun from the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University about how China plans to reduce emissions to zero. Below are excerpts from the interview edited for clarity. What are the major challenges for China to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060?China's carbon dioxide emissions would reach its peak by 2030, which means we have 30 years to meet the carbon neutrality deadline. But developed countries have 50-70 years, so our future emissions reduction process will be very urgent.The share of manufacturing in China's economy is much higher than those in developed countries, resulting in a relatively high per capita consumption of energy. Manufacturing consumes a large amount of power, which is, mainly produced by burning fossil fuels â coal, oil and gas â resulting in emissions. We are already shifting to green energy like solar and wind. There is a need to develop a digital economy, high-tech industries, and restructure industries to curb fossil fuels, boost low-carbon energy, and develop new and renewable energy sectors to bring down emission levels.Is there a timeline for reduction in the use of fossil fuels, especially coal? The share of coal in primary energy consumption has declined to nearly 57 percent, and non-fossil energy has exceeded 15 percent. Thus, by 2050, non-fossil energy may account for more than 90 percent of the total power generation. Only in this way can we make it possible to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060; under such a scenario, national five-year-plans become crucial. Thus, the 14th five-year plan could be vital to knowing the path our policymakers are paving to meet carbon neutrality and ensure economic growth.Which key sectors would have to reduce their emissions drastically?The power industry is the largest carbon emitter, accounting for about 40 percent of the nation's total emissions. Among the energy-intensive sectors, including iron and steel, cement, and building materials, chemicals, non-ferrous metals, and manufacturing, are directly or indirectly responsible for about 45 percent of the total national emissions. In addition to reducing final demand through a circular economy, these industries will have to adopt smart technologies and cleaner fuel to reduce their carbon footprint. We think that the power industry should take the lead and become the first one to decarbonize. How will the coronavirus pandemic impact China's plan to become carbon neutral?There is a Chinese proverbäººæ è¿è, å¿æè¿å¿§, which means, those who do not plan for the future will soon find trouble at their doorstep.Carbon neutrality is a long-term plan that will eventually help in preventing pandemics in the future. Moreover, biodiversity loss because of climate change could be strongly linked to viral outbreaks. The world will tide over the COVID-19 but preventing global temperature rise beyond 1.5-2 degrees Celsius would have many benefits, including reducing extreme weather events like wildfires, typhoons and floods. The current pandemic helps us to prepare for the commitments made during the Paris Climate Change Agreement.Apart from controlling industrial emissions, what else should be done to meet carbon neutrality?  We will also have to strengthen forestry, land use, and agriculture, which absorb carbon dioxide and boost biodiversity. At present, China has the world's largest planted forest and along with agriculture, wetlands, grasslands, and effective land use, it helps absorb about 800 million tons of carbon dioxide. This sector can help create green jobs and bring people closer to nature. What will be the impact of China's decision to go carbon neutral on the annual Climate Change Summit in Glasgow next year? We believe that President Xi Jinping's announcement would motivate other countries to strengthen their Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce their emissions and boost the morale of the Conference of Parties (COP26) in Glasgow. China is taking a responsible role in international and global governance and leading global efforts to fulfill the Paris Climate Agreement, sustainable development and economic recovery.He Jiankun is vice director, National Expert Committee on Climate Change and Academic Chair of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development, Tsinghua UniversityLi Zheng, is executive vice president of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development and Director of the Laboratory of Low Carbon Energy, Tsinghua UniversityVideo Editors: Oscar Margain, Gong Zhe(Cover: The City skyline is seen amid smog ahead of Chinese Lunar New Year in Beijing, China February 13, 2018. /Reuters)In a surprise announcement, Chinese President Xi Jinping said China would become a carbon-neutral country by 2060 during his virtual address at the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) last month.

Enthusiasts around the world have praised the fermented tea for some of its possible health benefits. CGTN's Nick Mudimba visited a kombucha maker based on the outskirts of Nairobi and brings us this report.It's said you are what you eat. Many Kenyans have been turning to healthier diets and working out to stay in shape. Away from the world of sugary sodas and chemical preservatives, Andrew Wachira is making and selling an alternative beverage.Andrew Wachira, Founder, Kombucha Kenya says: "Kombucha is tea that is fermented and is fermented by good bacteria, we also call them probiotics, and good bacteria will act on the sweetened tea and for seven days or so it will turn out into this drink we call Kombucha."The drink is said to also contain antioxidants which can kill harmful bacteria and boost the immune system.The ingredients Wachira uses to make kombucha include tea bags, sugar, culture or SCOBY an acronym that means Symbiotic Colony of Bacteria and Yeast, a starter liquid of a small amount of kombucha that has been brewed from a previous batch.He adds, "Steep the tea bags into hot water, steep it for a couple of minutes and thereafter you can add sugar, you can even add sugar while the tea is hot, the sugar can be more soluble in the tea and afterwards you now have to put it into the container that you are going to brew it â¦ Once you put the sweetened tea into the fermentation bucket or the container all you need to do is to add more water so that it can take the temperature down to room temperature, after that we now add the starter liquid and the scoby, the starter liquid comes first you give it a good stir and thereafter you add the scoby and you place it on top of that brew and you cover it."The tea which comes in many flavours is left to ferment for two or three weeks. Many of Wachira's clients come to him directly to pick up their supply.With nutritionists warning of the health risks associated with sweetened fizzy drinks like sodas, demand is moving towards healthier beverages like Kombucha - and Wachira says it's the health benefits that keep his clients coming back for more. Kombucha has been gaining popularity in Kenya.

Skin whitening and the issue of colorism has been linked to a complex history of colonialism and slavery. And as CGTN's Patrick Oyet reports buying of skin lightening creams continues despite government ban.Each individual bleaching here has their own reasons for doing so."Skin whitening is good, I like it because it makes me look like a white lady, but I don't want to overdo it, I just want to maintain how I look now, my advice to those whitening their skin is that don't apply the much at one, whitening is a process that takes time," Joyce Keji Emmanuel, Juba Resident says.Before independence in 2011, more light-skinned Arab Sudanese ruled a then-united Sudan out of Khartoum.The main goal of successive regimes in Khartoum was to Islamize and Arabize Sudan. The blacks from the Southern Part of the country were religiously and politically marginalized and suffered discrimination due to their skin colour.Many women and girls opted to whiten their skin to look more like the Arab population.Bleaching is not limited to women and girls, some men in South Sudan are also whitening their skin.But some people resist the idea of whitening their skin.Susan Kim Otor, Coordinator, defy-hate-now submits: "I believe in my creator, and he did not make a mistake when he created me black, and I believe I am beautiful in my natural color. So, why destroy it with such unnatural things."However, medical experts are warning of the dangers of skin whitening."Some patients also develop deposition of these toxic agents into some organs like the liver because by the way you apply it on the skin, it's absorbed in the blood, taken by the blood circulation system and deposited into various organs, that's the worst part that many people are experiencing," Dr. Francis Oromo, a medic argues.The government says it has halted the sale and use of the cosmetics for whitening skin across the country.Peter Baak, Director General, Drug and Food Control Authority, South Sudan says, "We have banned the use of body whitening creams, the policy is clear and we will continue to make sure that our market in South Sudan is free from unwanted cosmetics to ensure that our people are not harmed."However, most of Juba's markets have several stores, where people can buy bleaching agents.And people like Joyce Keji continue to access them and whiten their skin. Skin bleaching is a popular practice with many South Sudanese - especially among but not limited to, women and girls.

Another 67,000 customers in Texas were without power, while Mississippi reported almost 34,000 outages.About 15,000 were without power in Georgia and South Carolina, where Delta was expected to dump rain Sunday before moving up the East Coast.The storm still had 30 mph winds early Sunday, though it was expected to weaken significantly by early Monday, according to the National Weather Service.Northeast Georgia and the western portion of Virginia and the Carolinas could see up to 6 inches of rain, creating flash flooding risks across the region, the weather service said. The Central Appalachians and southern New Jersey could get drenched as well, forecasters said.Tornadoes are possible across the Carolinas on Sunday, the weather service said. Flash flooding is possible from north Georgia to southern Virginia.Five tornadoes were reported in the Atlanta metro area. In Covington, east of Atlanta, a suspected tornado left one person with minor injuries and damaged a homeless shelter, displacing 30 people, the city's emergency management director, Jody Nolan, told CNN."Even if it wasn't quite as powerful as Hurricane Laura it was much bigger," Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said Saturday. "Obviously, this was a very serious, very large and powerful storm that produced significant amounts of damage."(With input from agencies)At least half a million households and businesses were in the dark on Sunday morning after Hurricane Delta, which hit Louisiana, weakened to a post-tropical cyclone and headed across the Southeast.Most of the customers without electricity, about 360,000 of them, were in Louisiana, where the hurricane made landfall Friday, according to poweroutage.us.

Huayao Dai people are part of the Dai ethnic group, who mostly dwell in Jiasa township of Xinping Yi and Dai Autonomous County, southwest China's Yunnan Province. The closed geographic environment of Xinping has made it possible for Huayao Dai people to keep their traditional customs such as worshiping gods, tattooing and tooth dyeing. For the older generation of Huayao Dai women, the black teeth are a symbol of beauty and dental health.

Job losses, illness, financial difficulties, and even some people's fear of contracting the virus from pets, led to a rise in animal abandonments in the UK. When people were furloughed or working from home, the adoption rate went up. During the first week of lockdown Battersea Dogs and Cats Home reported 86 dogs and 69 cats were rehomed, rising from 42 and 29 respectively in the same period last year.While this might look like a positive trend, and these animals went to good homes, it is too early to say that lockdown united all abandoned animals across the UK with new owners for the long term. When people go back to work their priorities change and newly-adopted pets can be at risk of ending up in a shelter because of the lack of time and commitment from their owners. Compared with the same period last year, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) charity received four times more calls from prospective owners when the UK went into lockdown â but now the organization has been receiving calls from those who want to return their new pets.  "People have gone back to work and then suddenly realized that this puppy doesn't fit into their life any more," says Herchran Boal, an RSPCA inspector in the West Midlands. "It's almost as if they didn't think about that. And that's very sad because a pet is for life, it's not just for the lockdown period."During the first three months of the lockdown the RSPCA received almost 3,500 calls â 40 a day â about abandoned animals, including 1,509 dogs, 1,165 cats, 299 small animals such as hamsters and guinea pigs and 275 exotic animals. The closure of RSPCA centers, shortage of staff and a surge of abandoned animals put the charity in a very difficult position. "I've been an inspector for 20 years and this is the worst that anything has affected the RSPCA," says Boal. "We have a service that was being provided for 24 hours a day but due to the pandemic we've had to close our control centers overnight. We have always been an organization that's gone on 24/7 because animals don't get sick just nine to five. People need us all the time."As a charity, the RSPCA relies on public donations â but fundraising events had to be stopped and the donations from the public have slowed down due to the COVID-19 crisis. "The NHS have done an amazing job and they're really great," says Boal. "But let's not forget the animals. The animals are what keep some people going, really. The pets are very important to them."Video editing: Riaz JugonThe COVID-19 crisis not only transformed our lives, it also had an impact on the welfare of animals.

Even after they die, they stand strong for another thousand years. And when they collapse, they don't decompose for an additional thousand years.Diversifolious in Latin means varied-leaved. The shape of the leaves changes with time. Younger trees have narrow leaves so they don't need too much water to grow. Full-fledged trees have rounder and bigger leaves to gravitate more sunlight.Rose willow can often be found around these poplars. Locals call rose willow and diversifolious poplar "couple plants" of the desert.In addition, these poplars provide durable and sturdy building material.

They have eliminated agricultural export subsidies, enhanced market access for cotton and cotton by-product exports from LDCs and worked to enable developing countries to benefit more from every step of the cotton value chain. Nevertheless, it is widely believed that more can be done to level the playing field for cotton producers, especially in LDCs.The annual World Cotton Day celebrations are an opportunity to recognize the importance of this global commodity â and to push forward with positive economic, development and sustainable trade policies.For the 2020 edition, the WTO has established a dedicated webpage that brings together contributions from ministers, ambassadors, heads of organizations and the private sector on the importance of cotton and the relevance of World Cotton Day to their respective countries and organizations.  The WTO has also set up a stand in its headquarters to celebrate cotton, with the distribution of souvenirs and information on cotton to staff and delegates.The importance of cotton to Cotton-4 countriesCotton production is the source of livelihood to over 4 million farmers in Africa, of which around 1 million are located in the Cotton-4 countries.For the Cotton-4 countries, cotton earnings represent between 8 to 12% of their annual Gross Domestic Production (GDP) and account for up to 40% of their total export revenue.Current world cotton production is above 26 million tonnes from which more than 8 million tonnes are traded globally every year.The Cotton-4 countries export approximately 800,000 tonnes of cotton per year, totalling around 10% of the total world cotton exports.(With input from World Trade Organization)The spotlight was shone on the importance of cotton for millions of farmers, processors and traders globally as the  World Trade Organization marked the first anniversary of World Cotton Day.The Cotton-4 group (Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad and Mali) initiated the cotton sectoral initiative at the WTO with the aim of improving the global trade rules as they relate to cotton, and to shed light on the many linkages among trade, cotton and development.World Cotton Day aims to highlight the numerous gains enabled by international trade in cotton, including: selling to consumers abroad; increasing foreign exchange earnings; attracting investment in local businesses; employing more workers; and fostering growth and technology transfer in the wider economy.While widely appreciated as a fibre used to make textiles and clothes, cotton is also used in the production of edible oils, animal feed and fuel. Cotton production, processing, and trade represent a key source of income for a number of economies worldwide.In many African least developed countries (LDCs), cotton is key to job creation and economic stability.At the WTO, members have taken meaningful steps to promote cotton trade.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts.

Much of the continent saw above average temperatures for September, especially southeastern Europe.Western Europe also experienced bursts of record-breaking heatwaves last month, with temperatures reaching unusually high levels.The northern French city of Lille in mid-September had its hottest September day since records began in 1945, while cities in Germany and the UK experienced the highest September temperatures in four years.In Russia, according to the state weather service, last month was the country's hottest September in the 130 years since records began.  The Russian Hydrometeorology Center said almost every part of the country had experienced temperatures that were several degrees above average, with the largest anomalies of temperatures exceeding the average by five to six degrees Celsius observed in north Eurasia near the Arctic Circle.C3S scientists also found that in the Siberian Arctic, temperatures continued to be warmer than average in September, continuing a heatwave that affected different parts of the vast region since early spring."Although Siberia and the Arctic have large temperature fluctuations from year to year, the relative warmth observed this year has been unusual in its magnitude and persistence," Copernicus said in a statement. Melting Arctic sea iceAlongside the increasing temperatures in the Arctic, C3S also confirmed that sea ice levels have been melting and are in decline. The figures show that the average Arctic sea ice extent for September was the second lowest recorded, after September 2012.  Sea ice extent in the Arctic has declined noticeably since 1979 when satellite observations began. The trend can be seen throughout the year, but especially in September when the ice cover reaches its minimum extent for the year before starting to build up again."In 2020, there was an unusually rapid decline in Arctic sea ice extent during June and July, in the same region where above average temperatures were recorded, preconditioning the sea ice minimum to be particularly low this year," Carlo Buontempo, Director of Copernicus Climate Change Service said."The combination of record temperatures and low Arctic sea ice in 2020 highlight the importance of improved and more comprehensive monitoring in a region warming faster than anywhere else in the world," he added. Globally, September 2020 was 0.05 degrees Celsius warmer than the same month last year â which had been the warmest on record, according to scientists from Copernicus.In addition, temperatures in the Siberian Arctic continue to be much above average and Arctic sea ice is at its second lowest extent since satellite records began.  Temperatures in September were well above average in many regions across the globe, including off the coast of northern Siberia, and many parts of Europe, with many countries experiencing their warmest September on record.The numbers analyzed by the Copernicus Climate Change Service show that the month was 0.63 degrees Celsius above the average September temperatures of the standard thirty-year climatological reference period (1981-2010).This means that as well as being warmer than last year, this September was also 0.8 degrees Celsius warmer than September 2016, the second-warmest on record.  Europe's September heatwavesAcross Europe, September average temperatures reached a record high, about 0.2 degrees Celsius warmer than the previous warmest September of 2018.

The downpours have destroyed houses and washed away roads on the border between the two countries near Nice.These storms have been attributed to climate change and scientists believe they're likely to increase in frequency and volume in the years ahead â but hope natural interventions could dramatically reduce their impact. CLICK: HOW THE EDUCATION SECTOR IS ADAPTING TO COVID-19 RESTRICTIONS  The results of the study showed that in areas where new woodlands have been planted, the ability of soil to absorb water was almost double that of areas with no trees.This means that huge quantities of rainwater could be more readily absorbed by trees, rather than it simply running over the surface and into rivers where it subsequently causes severe flooding.The study's authors say their findings show the planting of more woodlands in upland areas could be an effective and natural flood management tool.Thomas Murphy, who led the research as part of his PhD, said: "Many UK upland areas have a history of soil compaction and the aim of our study was to define how quickly this nature-based solution could affect that."  He added: "People perhaps think that trees need to be mature in order for them to have beneficial environmental effects. But across our four test sites, we showed they can make significant improvements to soil properties within just 15 years of establishment, meaning it can be a viable option for flood prevention in a relatively modest time frame."This nature-based solution could be extremely timely, given the commitment of the UK government to plant 30 million trees a year by 2025 and other environmental schemes designed to enhance carbon retention, biodiversity and flood prevention. But scientists have warned that new woodlands will require careful placement if the benefits are to be maximized. The research concluded that that steep hillsides on the edge of upland areas provide the most effective location for tree plantations to serve as an effective flood-prevention tool.  Planting new woodlands in upland areas could help bring an end to flash flooding in the UK within 15 years, according to a new study published by the University of Plymouth. The UK is just one of several European countries to have been hit by serious flooding in recent years, prompting  research into how trees could be used to absorb rainwater.In February, large parts of the English Midlands and Yorkshire were left submerged in water after Storm Dennis hit the UK, resulting in serious damage to local communities and several deaths.Storm Alex also caused nearly a year's rainfall to come down on France and Italy in the space of just 12 hours this week.

Some of the animals, such as sheep, have not yet been studied with infection tests, so this does not confirm the species can indeed be infected.Lead author Christine Orengo, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "We wanted to look beyond just the animals that had been studied experimentally, to see which animals might be at risk of infection and would warrant further investigation and possible monitoring."The animals we identified may be at risk of outbreaks that could threaten endangered species or harm the livelihoods of farmers. The animals might also act as reservoirs of the virus, with the potential to reinfect humans later on, as has been documented on mink farms."The research team also performed more detailed structural analyses for certain animals, to gain a better understanding of how infection risks may differ across animal species. By comparing their findings to other experimental data, they set thresholds to predict which animals are at risk of infection, and which ones most likely cannot be infected.They found that most birds, fish, and reptiles do not appear to be at risk of infection, but the majority of the mammals they reviewed could potentially be infected.Orengo added: "The details of host infection and severity of response are more complex than just the interactions of the spike protein with ACE2, so our research is continuing to explore interactions involving other host virus proteins."  The team's findings mostly agree with experiments conducted in living animals and with reported cases of infections. They predict possible infection in domestic cats, dogs, mink, lions, and tigers, all of which have had reported cases, as well as ferrets and macaques, which have been infected in laboratory studies.First author, Su Datt Lam, who specializes in structural and molecular biology at UCL and the National University of Malaysia, said: "Unlike laboratory-based experiments, the computational analyses we devised can be run automatically and rapidly. Therefore, these methods could be applied easily to future virus outbreaks that, unfortunately, are becoming more common due to human encroachment into natural habitats."  Co-author Joanne Santini, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "To protect animals, as well as to protect ourselves from the risk of one day catching COVID-19 from an infected animal, we need large-scale surveillance of animals, particularly pets and farm animals, to catch cases or clusters early on while they're still manageable."It may also be important to employ hygiene measures when dealing with animals, similar to the behaviours we've all been learning this year to reduce transmission and for infected people to isolate from animals as well as from other people." Numerous animals may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, according to a large study modeling how the virus might infect different species' cells.The study, published in Scientific Reports and led by researchers at University College London (UCL) reports evidence that 26 animals regularly in contact with people may be susceptible to infection.The researchers investigated how the spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 could interact with the ACE2 protein it attaches to when it infects people.The focus of the investigation was whether mutations in the ACE2 protein in 215 different animals, which make it different from the human version, would reduce the stability of the binding complex between the virus protein and host protein. Binding to the protein enables the virus to gain entry into host cells; while it is possible the virus might be able to infect animals via another pathway, it is unlikely based on current evidence that the virus could infect an animal if it cannot form a stable binding complex with ACE2.  The researchers found that for some animals, such as sheep and great apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos, many of which are endangered in the wild), the proteins would be able to bind together just as strongly as they do when the virus infects people. Some of the animals, such as sheep, have not yet been studied with infection tests, so this does not confirm the species can indeed be infected.Lead author Christine Orengo, a professor of structural and molecular biology at UCL, said: "We wanted to look beyond just the animals that had been studied experimentally, to see which animals might be at risk of infection and would warrant further investigation and possible monitoring."The animals we identified may be at risk of outbreaks that could threaten endangered species or harm the livelihoods of farmers. The animals might also act as reservoirs of the virus, with the potential to reinfect humans later on, as has been documented on mink farms."The research team also performed more detailed structural analyses for certain animals, to gain a better understanding of how infection risks may differ across animal species. By comparing their findings to other experimental data, they set thresholds to predict which animals are at risk of infection, and which ones most likely cannot be infected.They found that most birds, fish, and reptiles do not appear to be at risk of infection, but the majority of the mammals they reviewed could potentially be infected.Orengo added: "The details of host infection and severity of response are more complex than just the interactions of the spike protein with ACE2, so our research is continuing to explore interactions involving other host virus proteins."  The team's findings mostly agree with experiments conducted in living animals and with reported cases of infections.

French authorities said at least eight people were missing, including two firemen whose vehicle was carried away by a swollen river, according to local witnesses.  Army and helicopters join the effortThe French army and hundreds of rescuers were deployed to search for the missing, including using helicopters to transport aid and evacuate people where possible. An emergency services spokesman in France said that around 40 people stranded on roads by the landslides had sheltered in an old train station and then been airlifted to safety.The storm ravaged several villages around the city of Nice on the French Riviera. Nice mayor Christian Estrosi called it the worst flooding disaster in the area for more than a century, after flying over the area by helicopter. "The roads and about 100 houses were swept away or partially destroyed," he told French news channel BFM."I do not hide from you our deep concern about the final outcome of this episode," said prime minister Jean Castex, adding "I have been particularly shocked by what I saw today." Amid concerns that the death toll could rise, Castex said that the government had triggered its emergency plan for handling natural disasters.  In Breil-sur-Roya, a French village close to the Italian border, houses were buried in mud and turned-over cars stuck in the riverbed. Rescue efforts were concentrated on the Roya valley where roughly 1,000 firefighters, backed by helicopters and the army, resumed their search for survivors and helped people whose homes were destroyed or inaccessible.Eric Ciotti, a member of French parliament who is from one of the worst affected villages in the area, Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie, said several villages were cut off in the mountainous region's steep-sided valleys. "The situation is catastrophic in some communes," Ciotti said.Meteo France said that 500 millimeters of rain was registered over 24 hours in Saint-Martin-VÃ©subie, with close to 400 millimeters falling in several other towns â the equivalent of more than three months of rain at this time of the year.Authorities in the southern Alpes-Maritimes region had been placed on alert Friday and around 12,000 people in three valleys to the north of Nice were without power early Saturday afternoon. France has now declared the region a natural disaster zone. Houses 'perched above the void'Roads had been washed away by the waters leaving buildings teetering above the voids. "You can also see a few houses that are perched above the void because the riverbed has washed away the road," said a fire brigade spokesman."We have actually had houses wiped out," said Alpes-Maritimes prefect Bernard Gonzalez. "What we are going through is extraordinary.""My three-story house, it's in the river," said villager Sandra Dzidt, 62, who had to flee the floods dressed only in her nightgown. "All I have left is a tiny piece of wall and a door."  "We are thunderstruck. We saw the (river) Vesubie burst its banks â everything was swept away, including part of the old iron bridge," said Serge Franco, a resident of the Alpes-Maritimes village Roquebilliere."My house is habitable but half of my land has been swept away," said another resident, Guillaume Andre, who was evacuated overnight but returned to see the devastation after daybreak."I lost everything but we are alive," said Roquebilliere resident Jennyfer. "There must be one room left in my house.""The firefighters did not have enough rope, and even with our rope we could not reach the house, so it was too late to get to them and the house was suddenly swept away," added resident Patrick Theus.Gonzalez called on the families of the missing not to give up hope. "Just because their loved ones haven't been able to get in touch doesn't mean that they have been taken by the storm," he said. Many landline and some mobile phone services were disrupted, with some villages using satellite phones to communicate with rescue services.Despite forecasts of more rain, Gonzalez insisted that rescue efforts were to continue throughout Sunday. "The helicopter procession will continue all day long," he said.  Director of civil protection JÃ©rÃ©my Crunchant said there was heavier rainfall than on 3 October 2015, when floods caused the death of 20 people in and around the French Riviera city of Cannes.The presidents of Italy's Piedmont and Liguria regions signed a joint letter calling on the government to declare a state of emergency with several villages cut off. The mayor of the northern Italian city of Ventimiglia, Gaetano Scullino, said "a disaster of this kind has not happened since 1958."Cirio added Italy was already struggling to cope with the effects of the coronavirus which has left some 36,000 dead and shattered the economy over the past six months."We are already in an extraordinary situation," he said. "Because of the pandemic the region will this year receive 200 million euros ($234 million) less in tax receipts. If the state does not intervene we shall not recover."Meanwhile in Venice, a long-delayed flood barrier system including a network of 78 artificial dykes successfully protected the lagoon city from a high tide for the first time on Saturday, bringing huge relief following years of repeated inundations. Storm Alex has left at least three people dead and eight missing in southern France and northern Italy, bringing record rainfall in places and causing heavy flooding that swept away roads, damaged homes and left thousands without power.In Italy, at least two people died â a volunteer firefighter in the Aosta Valley and a man whose car was swept into the River Sesia in northern Italy after a road subsided.The water level in the River Po jumped by three meters in just 24 hours and officials in the Piedmont region reported a record 630 millimeters of rain in just 24 hours in Sambughetto, close to Italy's border with Switzerland. Dozens of firefighters were trying to reach one village by train after the road was shut, while neighboring Switzerland was also battered with record rainfall and powerful gusts, forcing the closure of roads and mountains. CLICK: THE CREWLESS, SOLAR-POWERED 'MAYFLOWER' MAKING THE SAME JOURNEY AS ITS HISTORIC NAMESAKE France suffered its first fatality on Sunday, a shepherd whose body was pulled from a river near the border.

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

When one enters through the gates, one will quickly notice a serene environment, lush bushes, and trees with birds perching here and there.The sanctuary hosts a large number of free grazing impalas, the rare Sitatunga antelope, Zebras, and the vervet monkeys.The caged animals include lions, leopards, buffalo, Ostrich, guinea fowls, and the baboons.This sanctuary is one of three in Kenya that was established to protect and rehabilitate wild animals as well as educate the public on wildlife conservation efforts. Others are the Nairobi Safari Walk and the Nairobi orphanage.Paul Omondi, the warden in charge of the Sanctuary says: "The reason why we have the orphanage and the safari walk and the impala sanctuary is that it is a refuge for the rescued wildlife, probably from human-wildlife conflict or problematic animals, the injured, and the orphaned. So the sanctuary is a way of offering them a home.âHere, unlike in the national parks, one will have a rare opportunity of seeing some of the animals up-close. The sanctuary is home to hundreds of impalas which boasts of the largest population followed by the Zebras.While taking a walk through the sanctuary, we observed herds of these herbivores which were busy grazing in the morning hours taking advantage of the cool breeze on the shores of the lake.Kisumu sun can be unforgiving, and it is based on this that Mr. Omondi encourages those who are interested in interacting with the animals as they feed, to always make it to the sanctuary in the morning before they retreat into the bushes away from the scorching sun."In terms of conservation fees for entry into the sanctuary, we charge adults Kenyans, Ksh. 200/$2 while children pay Ksh. 100/$1. For non-residents, we charge Ksh.2000/$20 and children Ksh.1500/$15." said Omondi.The low seasons for tourists both local and international are between January and April. The peak season runs between July and August while the high season remains to be September and December.However this year, the Sanctuary saw reduced numbers of visitors due to restrictions that were put in place by health authorities in an effort to halt the coronavirus pandemic spread.Lifespan in the cages vis a vis the wildLife in the wild is tough coupled with a rough terrain where only those who are swift survive.But as CGTN's Halligan Agade discovered, animals in this sanctuary seem to be enjoying life to the fullest because they are accessed to food and treatment unlike their counterparts in the wild.No wonder then Mr. Omondi submits that those in the wild have a shorter lifespan as compared to the caged ones, with the big cats for instance the lion likely to live up to 15 years even more in the cage."In the wild you know it is survival for the fittest but under captive management, the animals within the sanctuary tend to live longer because they are looked after, they are fed and treated."But there is another danger lurking in the shadows for these caged animals. Obesity. Just like humans, if caution is not taken, the Warden says, some animals especially the carnivores can be obese and this calls for the services of a veterinary expert to keep monitoring them since they do not run after their prey which is a form of exercise. This natural activity is only available in the wild."In terms of the feeding program, we're guided by our Veterinary team who come to inspect the animals on a monthly basis just to check the condition of the sanctuary, condition of the animals, the feeding regime, and the treatment regime."Controlled breedingBut it is not just obesity that is to be considered for the big cats, but the uncontrolled numbers of the herbivores like the Impalas must also be in check to control inbreeding to conserve a generation to make sure it does not face extinction arising from impure breeds."When we have a lot of animals like the impalas, we trans-locate them to Ndeere Island National Park. This is done in consultation with the species and research department in Nairobi. This is done to reduce the numbers and also give the excess numbers new habitat or new homes and also as a way of reducing inbreeding among the impalas that we have within the sanctuary."Interestingly, it is only the herbivores that can be translocated to the wild, however, for the carnivores, it doesn't happen."In captive management, in terms of the wild, it is a bit different for the lions that are under captive management. They are under cages, and they are fed. When you take them to the wild, they will have to fend for themselves and this is a habit they will have to learn. This poses a great danger to them in terms of survival and also existence." Omondi adds.But thanks to this sanctuary the endangered animals now have a place to call home.Free-ranging and captive animals are not the only attraction here, but bird-life, indigenous forest, swampy papyrus areas, grassland, rocky view area, nature trails, and sundowner viewpoint is also on the card for nature lovers.Set on the shore of Lake Victoria, the Kisumu Impala Sanctuary is just a ten minutes drive from the city center.

Other artifacts and at least 28 statues were found in the two deep wells, the ministry said.A sealed door was also unearthed where it is expected more mummies may lie behind, said Khaled el-Anany the first Minister of Antiquities and Tourism, adding that the artifacts were in an excellent state of preservation and would be displayed in the Grand Egyptian museum next year.Mostafa Waziri, the general director of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told NBC News that the discovery reminded him of the tomb of King Tutankhamun, because both had been discovered almost intact.The Saqqara plateau is part of the necropolis of Egypt's ancient city of Memphis. Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1970s, it includes the famed Giza Pyramids. It is also home to tombs created across thousands of years between the 1st Dynasty (2920 B.C.-2770 B.C.) and the Coptic period (395-642).Hundreds of mummified animals, birds and crocodiles, as well as two mummified lion cubs were found in the region last year.Egypt has heavily promoted new archaeological finds to international media and diplomats in recent years, in an effort to revive its tourism sector, which has suffered since the 2011 Arab Spring uprisings that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak.The sector was dealt a further blow this year by the coronavirus pandemic.Last week, the ministry displayed a bronze statue of the god "Nefertam," one of the artifacts discovered with the ancient wooden coffins.Inlaid with precious stones red agate, turquoise and lapis lazuli, it reached a height of 35 cm (14 in) and on its base is inscribed with the name of the owner of the statue, a priest called "Badi Amun.""Saqqara antiquities area is still revealing its secrets," the ministry said.(With input from agencies)Archeologists in Egypt announced on Saturday that they had discovered at least 59 ancient coffins in a vast necropolis south of the country's capital Cairo, one containing the pristine mummy of an ancient priest. This is than 2,600 years since they were buried. The ornate sarcophagi have remained unopened since they were entombed near the famed Step Pyramid of Djoser in Saqqara, according to Egypt's Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.Footage shared by the ministry showed colorful sarcophagi decorated with ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics.

Virtually all the damage has been done since mid-August, when five of the six largest fires in state history erupted. Lightning strikes caused some of the most devastating blazes.Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said wildfires have scorched 3.9 million acres in California since Aug. 15. That figure, which works out to over 6,000 square miles (15,500 square kilometers), is astonishing even in a state that has had its fair share of fires."It's likely that over the next day or two we will crest the 4-million-acre mark. The biggest year before this year was 1.54 million," Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said. "We are dwarfing that previous record and we have a lot of season left to go."Fire officials said the Glass Fire had first priority. Since erupting last Sunday, the fire has destroyed nearly 600 buildings, including 220 homes and nearly the same number of commercial structures.Some 80,000 people were under evacuation orders, which were expanded on Thursday.Four million acres have been burned this year by wildfires and leaving behind a trail of death of 30 people and incinerated hundreds of homes in what is already the worst fire season on record in California.The fires have torched an area larger than Connecticut and fire crews at a blaze in the northern wine country were on high alert as forecasters warned of red flag conditions of extreme fire danger into Saturday morning.Winds up to 30 mph (48 kph) were forecast to push through the hills in Napa and Sonoma counties as the Glass Fire, exploded in size earlier in the week, continued to threaten more than 28,000 homes and other buildings."It's a time of nervousness," said Paul Gullixon, a spokesman for Sonoma County.Winds were blowing at higher elevations on the western side of the fire and crews expected a long battle to keep flames from jumping containment lines and spot fires from leaping ahead to spark new blazes."It's going to be a big firefight for us over the next 36 hours," said Billy See, an assistant chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire.More crews and equipment were deployed in and around Calistoga, a town of 5,000 people known for hot springs, mud baths and wineries in the hills of Napa County about 70 miles (110 kilometers) north of San Francisco.The area was also experiencing high temperatures and thick smoke that fouled the air throughout the San Francisco Bay Area.Around the state, 17,000 firefighters were battling nearly two dozen major blazes. Virtually all the damage has been done since mid-August, when five of the six largest fires in state history erupted. Lightning strikes caused some of the most devastating blazes.Numerous studies have linked bigger wildfires in America to climate change from the burning of coal, oil and gas. Scientists say climate change has made California much drier, meaning trees and other plants are more flammable.Cal Fire Deputy Chief Jonathan Cox said wildfires have scorched 3.9 million acres in California since Aug. 15. That figure, which works out to over 6,000 square miles (15,500 square kilometers), is astonishing even in a state that has had its fair share of fires."It's likely that over the next day or two we will crest the 4-million-acre mark. The biggest year before this year was 1.54 million," Cal Fire Chief Thom Porter said.

said on Friday.Authorities declared a three-month state of emergency in early September after the worst flooding in 30 years.To date, more than 860,000 people have had houses destroyed or damaged and more than 120 people have died.Some 560 schools and thousands of health facilities have also been affected, compromising essential services to communities, especially in North Darfur, Khartoum, West Darfur, and Sennar, which account for 52 percent of all people affected.400,000 reached and countingThe response by UN agencies and partners has reached more than 400,000 people so far, including emergency shelter and essential household items relief to over 181,000 flood-affected refugees, 1.87 million internally displaced people, and Sudanese across the country.Meanwhile, COVID-19 virus transmission has continued, with 13,653 confirmed cases of the pandemic with 836 deaths, according to official data from the World Health Organization (WHO).Amid growing needs, surging inflation â reaching nearly 170 percent in August â has caused a shortage of basic commodities and increased prices of some locally sourced supplies by 300 to 400 percent."In some cases, by the time the procurement process is finalized, the supplies have increased prices, so that the original budgets are no longer valid," said OCHA spokesperson Jens Laerke.He explained that this meant the purchasing process had to begin again and "there is no guarantee that by the time that that process is done, that the prices will not have risen once again".Healthcare costs have also increased by up to 90 percent, OCHA Sudan said in a recent tweet.In Geneva, Mr. Laerke noted that the price of an average family food basket had increased by over 200 percent since last year, based on World Food Programme (WFP) data, increasing pressure on already dramatic levels of food insecurity across Sudan, where 9.6 million people are described as "severely " in need.Cash shortfallsInflation has also affected the UN's humanitarian partners which provide cash support to vulnerable families, as they are constantly having to adjust the amounts transferred, Mr. Laerke said.Even with these adjustments, many families are no longer able to purchase what they need with the cash received.Today, only one in four families who previously relied on outside assistance now receives it, the OCHA spokesperson said.Crop failureAnother concern in Sudan is that large areas of farmland are underwater or ruined just before harvest."Most families in Sudan already spent around 65 percent of their income on food, so these price hikes lead to increased hunger and less education, health and other services that families de-prioritize as they try to cope with the economic hardship,"

caused unprecedented rainfall and flooding in others.Africa's largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria is one such example.Water levels in the lake are at unprecedented heights due to more than a year of heavy rains in the East African region.According to Eastern Africa Consortium for Clinical Research, the current rise in the lake began on 1st October 2019 and significantly went up from 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020. It was a 1.32 meters rise attained in only 6 months before hitting an all-time high of 13.42-meter mark by September this year.However, heavy rain isn't the only thing fueling Lake Victoria's rising levels. Environmental degradation, urbanization, and other human activity all play a part.Dr. Raymond Omollo the Director at Lake Basin Development Authority says that development is good for humanity, but it can also change the ecosystem."On the Ugandan side, there has been a huge hydro-project, so again that limits the amount of water that is flowing out of the lake at any given time. With this, you have the backflow so then you do not release as much water as you would ordinarily," Dr. Omollo says.The Kenyan government is also constructing dams to help manage the flow of water to the lake. Authorities have embarked on afforestation programs to help water catchment areas to reduce soil erosion.Human activities along the shores of the lake have also impacted the massive lake especially deforestation and agricultural activities.Officials say that there must be a concerted effort to target these activities and make sure that they are controlled to save the lake."In order for us to manage this easily, firstly we must target the areas where people do agriculture because that's where land has been opened up. Cultivation has been done and any little rain will wash away the topsoil, get it into the river, and from there, it will go settling," Ken K'oyoo the Director of the Environment in Kisumu County explains.People close to the lake are being advised to relocate to other areas. Officials worry the lake might continue to swell and displace more people who have lived along its shores for over a half a century now."When you drive along the lake, there are huge investments whether in the hospitality industry and when the water levels rise, a number of facilities in Kisumu were not usable, because they were partly submerged," Dr. Omollo adds.Climate change has become one of the main agendas of the United Nations Environment-UNEP with the clarion call that global citizens must unite to reduce its impact. The changing weather patterns have without a doubt resulted in many natural disasters across the world and loss of lives."It is a pointer to the fact that climate change is real and unless we are able to make our voices heard and do something about its impact, then very soon we would probably lose a lot of livelihoods and the beautiful lake, the resource that we have might end up being a curse rather than a blessing," Dr. Omollo says.Climate change has not only led to drought, wildfires, and ice melting in some parts of the globe, but it has also caused unprecedented rainfall and flooding in others.Africa's largest freshwater lake, Lake Victoria is one such example.Water levels in the lake are at unprecedented heights due to more than a year of heavy rains in the East African region.According to Eastern Africa Consortium for Clinical Research, the current rise in the lake began on 1st October 2019 and significantly went up from 12.00 meters to 13.32 meters as of 30th April 2020.

These measures, such as expediting legislation to protect biodiversity, drawing red lines for ecological protection, establishing a national park system, undertaking major projects for biodiversity protection, and coordinating and advancing biodiversity management will help the country to reach carbon neutrality by 2060 and to ensure China's greenhouse gas emissions peak by 2030. He also called for multilateralism in protecting biodiversity.French President Emmanuel Macron stressed the need to step up the fight against environmental crime, and to put a definitive end to all illegal activities that endanger nature, destroy ecosystems, feed corruption, hinder the development of the rule of law and, ultimately undermine the sustainable development of humanity. He also called for the transformation of the current models of production, trade and consumption, as well as public investment to enable the transformation. He also said France will mobilize for the adoption of an ambitious new global strategic framework for the protection of biodiversity at next year's UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Canada is striving to be a leader in protecting the environment, and surpassed its target of protecting 10 percent of marine areas by 2020. He pledged to protect 30 percent of land and oceans by 2030.While many countries have joined the UN in pledging to protect 30 percent of their land and seas by 2030, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro strongly opposed "international greed" towards the Amazon rainforest, and said that countries have the right to use their natural resources and "that is precisely what we intend to do with the huge wealth of resources found in the Brazilian territory."Our planet is facing severe threats from biodiversity loss and requires urgent attention and efforts to reverse the damage. Recent assessments by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) concluded that species extinction rates are tens to hundreds of times higher now than historical averages.Seventy-five percent of the Earth's land surface has been significantly altered by human actions, including the loss of 85 percent of wetlands area, and 66 percent of the ocean is experiencing multiple impacts from people, including from fisheries, pollution, and chemical changes from acidification.(With input from Xinhua and statistics from UN official website.

As well as providing a habitat for many marine species, it also captures carbon 35 times faster than a rainforest. But in recent years, fields of the plant have shrunk as a result of pollution, an influx in fishing and a rise in coastal development.  CLICK: FOR MORE STORIES FROM RAZOR, CGTN'S BRAND NEW SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWThe group of marine biologists from Swansea University, backed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Sky Ocean Rescue, has embarked on a $515,000 project named Project Seagrasses to restore the meadows to their previous state. RAZOR's Jo Colan joined the team of scientists in Dale Fort, Wales as they began the first ever seagrass restoration replanting in the UK. Richard Unsworth, one of the marine biologists in the team said: "Seagrasses have been decimated around the UK. We think that the UK has lost at least 90 percent of its seagrass. So it remains a scattered, fragmented habitat that used to be a very dominant part of the coast of the UK."Over the summer, the team collected more than 750,000 seeds from across the UK and then transported them back to the University's labs.The seeds were then washed and artificially vernalised (kept at a near-freezing temperature to mimic the winter season.) After that, the temperature was increased, allowing them to germinate, before they were put in bags and dropped into the sea.  They used the help of children from a local primary school to help fill the bags with seeds, with the hope it will help the next generation get a better understanding of the importance of the process."We came up with the idea of using a pretty simplistic little bag, the sort of hessian bag that your Christmas soap gets packed in and gets a little bow on it. Making sure they are nicely topped up with sand," Unsworth added, saying there are about 50 seeds in each bag.In around six months, the first seagrass shoots from the project are expected to emerge on the seabed."Well, we face a growing climate emergency and we have to make important rapid steps as a planet to fight that emergency. Seagrasses store vast amounts of carbon in their sediments. And they do that very, very rapidly so it can stay and remain locked away for millennia. We also face a biodiversity emergency, where all populations of all major animals and plants on this planet are in decline," Unsworth explained.Video editing: Natalia LuzA team of UK scientists has launched an "emergency" seagrass restoration project to try to revive the country's underwater meadows. World leaders are set to meet on Wednesday at a United Nations summit to discuss the "urgent action on biodiversity for sustainable development" as it continues to be a growing global issue. Seagrass is the only flowering plant in the world that can pollinate underwater. As well as providing a habitat for many marine species, it also captures carbon 35 times faster than a rainforest. But in recent years, fields of the plant have shrunk as a result of pollution, an influx in fishing and a rise in coastal development.  CLICK: FOR MORE STORIES FROM RAZOR, CGTN'S BRAND NEW SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY SHOWThe group of marine biologists from Swansea University, backed by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) and Sky Ocean Rescue, has embarked on a $515,000 project named Project Seagrasses to restore the meadows to their previous state. RAZOR's Jo Colan joined the team of scientists in Dale Fort, Wales as they began the first ever seagrass restoration replanting in the UK. Richard Unsworth, one of the marine biologists in the team said: "Seagrasses have been decimated around the UK. We think that the UK has lost at least 90 percent of its seagrass. So it remains a scattered, fragmented habitat that used to be a very dominant part of the coast of the UK."Over the summer, the team collected more than 750,000 seeds from across the UK and then transported them back to the University's labs.The seeds were then washed and artificially vernalised (kept at a near-freezing temperature to mimic the winter season.) After that, the temperature was increased, allowing them to germinate, before they were put in bags and dropped into the sea.  They used the help of children from a local primary school to help fill the bags with seeds, with the hope it will help the next generation get a better understanding of the importance of the process."We came up with the idea of using a pretty simplistic little bag, the sort of hessian bag that your Christmas soap gets packed in and gets a little bow on it. Making sure they are nicely topped up with sand," Unsworth added, saying there are about 50 seeds in each bag.In around six months, the first seagrass shoots from the project are expected to emerge on the seabed."Well, we face a growing climate emergency and we have to make important rapid steps as a planet to fight that emergency. Seagrasses store vast amounts of carbon in their sediments. And they do that very, very rapidly so it can stay and remain locked away for millennia. We also face a biodiversity emergency, where all populations of all major animals and plants on this planet are in decline," Unsworth explained.Video editing: Natalia LuzSitting in northeast China's Liaoning Province, Shenyang's bird island is a natural bird observance center.

The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) report last year found nearly 1 million species are on the verge of extinction.The Living Planet Report prepared by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and Zoological Society of London calculated global populations of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and fish decline by an average two-third in less than half a century.In order to protect the global biodiversity, world leaders committed to 20 targets in 2010 during a meeting at Aichi in Japan. None of the 20 targets agreed on by the governments were able to be met, found a review of the 'Aichi Targets" released early this month. The summit will be an opportunity to demonstrate ambition to accelerate action on controlling and reversing the biodiversity loss, said the CBD. The commitments made at New York would undergo revision and leaders would decide a new biodiversity framework during the Conference of Parties (COP15), UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming, China next year."We call on all leaders to build on this ambition at the forthcoming UN Summit on Biodiversity," said Marco Lambertini, director general of WWF-International."Together, they must develop and agree on a shared plan for the biodiversity and climate negotiations scheduled for next year, to secure a carbon-neutral, nature-positive and equitable future for all. There has never been a more crucial time to act for nature than now," he added.(A farmer in South Africa harvesting rooibos, which is commonly used for making herbal tea. /Natural Justice.)Political leaders from 64 countries have pledged to protect the environment and reverse massive loss of species ahead of the United Nations Summit on Biodiversity, which is scheduled to be held in New York on Wednesday.They committed to work towards a range of issues, including climate change, marine ecosystem protection, sustainable land use, restoring migration routes and many other areas to prevent the alarming scale of biodiversity loss in the world."This pledge is a recognition of this crisis and an expression of the need for a profound re-commitment from world leaders to take urgent action," stated the signed document."Against the backdrop of COVID-19, which has crippled the world's economies and pressured governments everywhere to begin the process of rebuilding and renewing, decisions made now will have ramifications for all of us and for generations to come."With the world facing the coronavirus pandemic and failing to meet the 2020 biodiversity targets agreed in 2010, the summit would be an opportunity for world leaders to revise their goals and commitment to protect nature."The connections between human well-being and the health of our ecosystems are extensive," said Elizabeth Maruma Mrema, executive secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) at the round table "Biodiversity Beyond 2020: Building a Shared Future for All Life on Earth.""The challenges of climate change and COVID-19 show us the importance of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use to ensure a more secure, inclusive and resilient world," she added.    Many experts have established strong links between biodiversity loss and viral outbreaks, seeking a concentrated global effort for sustainable development.A series of studies have also exposed the alarming loss of wild animals and plants because of human activities.
