With an average age of 90, the artists have made significant contributions to the development of this art-form in China.In total, there are 40 oil paintings on show at Beijing's Longfu Art Center. They were created by major figures in Chinese oil painting â Zhan Jianjun, Jin Shangyi, Quan Shanshi, Zhong Han and Wen Lipeng. They each devoted some 70 years to the art form, and established their own style and artistic language. It's the first time for them to have an exhibition together. "Our generation of painters, we have a sense of responsibility. After studying oil painting, we want to develop this art form in China. It's not like traditional Chinese painting, which has deep foundations in China. Oil panting was imported from the west. So we feel responsible to study it and promote it," said Wen Lipeng. Often addressed as the third generation of Chinese oil painters, the artists have played an important role in promoting oil painting in China. They are also the founders of the China Oil Painting Society. "In the past decades, the China Oil Painting Society has organized many exhibitions. And this time, I'm glad to see an exhibit that features us old people. It's a reminiscence as well as a new beginning for the China Oil Painting Society," said Jin Shangyi.Even in old age, the artists still have a strong desire to create. Many of the works in the exhibition are recent, giving audiences a chance to admire their artistic vitality. What the artists have in common is their insistence on developing oil paintings with a Chinese style. They studied the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western art in great depth. By mastering Western painting skills and combining them with traditional Chinese culture, the artists have managed to create works with unique Chinese characteristics. "The key question is in which direction Chinese oil painting should develop. I think we are clear that we need to follow the Chinese road. It is oil painting, but it's Chinese oil painting," said Wen Lipeng.The exhibition runs until November 30 and is free to the public.An exhibition showcasing the works of five prominent figures who have shaped the Chinese oil painting scene is on display in Beijing.

Its executive chef is 27-year-old trailblazer Lucas Sin.We find Sin in the kitchen of his Greenwich Village restaurant, ready to whip up a dish for a new onsite pop-kitchen called "Nice Day Chinese Takeout" that pays homage to American Chinese foodâ¦ a cuisine that has long fascinated Sin, an immigrant from Hong Kong."This is our take on chow mein, which is very popular in American Chinese restaurants," explained Sin from behind his mask as he speaks over a sizzling wok. "But the way we do it, the sauce that we put in, is more similar to the original Cantonese version than the American version."Sin's take on this quintessential American Chinese recipe hints at how the chef has kept the business going strong in a pandemic that has crippled the economy."I wanted to keep cooking creatively, and I wanted to keep thinking about the things I was interested in despite the pandemic."Sin was eager to defy stereotypes about Chinese food and give it the respect he felt the cuisine deserves, but he also wanted to explore the reach and evolution of Chinese food across cultures."I wanted to give my team a chance to research and think about how Chinese food might actually be good for you," he said.  "There's this sentiment that Chinese food must be bad for you if people are getting sick in China, there's that end of the narrative, and there's also my research in how big Chinese cuisine is across the Chinese diaspora all over the world."With restaurants only permitted take-out and deliveries, Junzi Kitchen launched several new initiatives including its "Share A Meal" program to help feed frontline workers.For his customers, he kicked off a series called "Distance Dining" in which he partnered with a diverse range of chefs to design fully cooked three-course meals that customers can order in advance, to show how Chinese food intersects with the cuisine of other cultures, from Creole to West African."Chinese food seems to have almost an uncanny ability to be everywhere around the world (and) touch so many different communities. I wanted to explore those intersections."Once the food is delivered, diners can tune in to an Instagram Live session with Sin and other chefs for a demonstration on how to properly heat the food for an authentic experience.Straight from the chefs' home kitchens, the sound of cooking is accompanied by a dash of banter and a sprinkle of humor. For those hungry for human connection in these strange times, it puts the "social" in social distancing.But the pandemic has been anything but social. For America's Chinese community, the coronavirus emerged as relations between China and the U.S. deteriorated and spilled over into Chinese communities.In New York, Chinese restaurants were hit by a one-two punch from the pandemic's economic fallout as well as a spike in racism against Asians, fueled by the White House which blamed China for the coronavirus.There were increasing reports of Asians being attacked or verbally assaulted, and Chinese restaurants vandalized and defaced. Sin had beer cans and a fluorescent light bulb thrown at him."Obviously, I'm surprised," Sin said."I think the wonderful thing about coming here to the U.S. as an immigrant is that I have the privilege of not needing to think of myself as a minority, but when friends in the industry especially have been facing expressive anti-Chinese sentiment, I think that's when it really hits home the most," he added.The upside, according to Sin, is that some in the businesses have chosen to build resilience. That might explain Junzi Kitchen's own story of survival."Our primary mission at Junzi is to show people that Chinese food is more wonderful and diverse than they might think otherwise," he told us."Just because there's a pandemic out there doesn't mean that the mission goes away."Unable to weather the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many restaurants in New York City have gone out of business, but one has defied the odds by focusing on the diversity of Chinese food and the power of social media.The restaurant is Junzi Kitchen, a modern fast-casual Chinese eatery in Manhattan that serves up fare described as authentic, honest and straightforward.

The event aims to stimulate the city's nighttime economy in places where drinks, food, and entertainment are offered. Everyone has free access to dozens of festival venues that the local government has set for its more than ten million people. Visitors attending it will find temperature and security checks along with health regulations when they arrive. The goal is to enjoy the event and contribute to the city revival. When it kicked off last weekend, the main venue in Dongxihu District didn't expect the tens of thousands of visitors who turned out, according to the organizer. "We didn't have enough on the first day, as many places serving beer and food were sold out within just half an hour," said Li Jiange, deputy chief of the Business Bureau of Dongxihu. "So, we doubled it the next day, but all of it went quickly again." Given the situation, many wondered if a mass gathering could be done safely. Officials say they conduct daily disinfection before the event. Health workers are monitoring the crowd. Besides, no local cases have been reported for months since Wuhan offered free mass testing in May. "You know, when you now walk in the city, everybody appears to have put those fears aside," said one visitor who celebrated his 50th birthday over some beers with the family. "Since this beer festival is happening, I feel like it's a great opportunity to tell people in other cities in China that Wuhan is fine. We're definitely fine and doing well," a beer vendor said. The event also provides opportunities for many local businesses, especially those featuring agricultural products in the district. Internet celebrities were invited to livestream for them, an increasingly popular marketing strategy now in China. Some stalls are making more than a thousand dollars a day. Young local bands are also putting their first-ever performance this year. Many expect the success of this event will have a positive impact and more large gatherings can be organized in the future.  Read more: Back to normal: Wuhan water party makes overseas netizens enviousThe city of Wuhan, hit hard several months ago by the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, is holding a week-long beer festival.

Among them is opera prodigy, Chinese countertenor Liu Shen. CGTN's Shen Li caught up with him during the festival's "Music at Noon" concert to find out how he came into this career and his future plans.At this mini recital at the Beijing Music Festival, Liu wowed the audience with his performances of Henry Purcell's "Music for a While," arias from some of Handel's operas, and Claude Debussy's Art Songs. He said this varied program helped express "my many sides."Liu is a countertenor, which means he has a vocal range that extends upwards from his natural tenor into mezzo-soprano.At the age of 5, his parents took him to see "La Traviata" and he has been obsessed with opera ever since.He went on to study at the Juilliard School and has collaborated with maestros like conductor Yu Long and the world's leading orchestras.Now at 20, the opera prodigy said he's still finding his voice.Liu said, "The countertenors, they don't just sing operas, there's a lot of non-gender specific pieces that we could do, so it's the best way to express myself."When asked about whether he could like to try music from other genres, Liu revealed his interest in jazz, Broadway music and even Peking Opera. "It's important to understand other genres of music," he added.Liu is able to sing in many different languages, including Italian, French, German and even Hebrew. "My passion for opera really sparks my passion for languages, the twos are somehow connected," he said.Apart from being active on stage as a countertenor, Liu is equally passionate about acting. "Through opera, I found out so many things about acting and music combined together â the beat, the rhythm," he said. "I would love to be an opera director because you get both the perspectives," he added. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the China Philharmonic Orchestra, five young musicians born in 2000 are taking center stage at the closing concert of Beijing Music Festival on Tuesday.

They have special visas that allow them to stay for 90 days with the option to renew twice. The first 14 days have to be spent in quarantine.Among other stipulations, they also need to have proof of travel insurance and medical insurance for in and outpatient treatment, as well as for treatment for COVID-19.After landing, their papers were checked, and their temperatures were taken before they were allowed through immigration. In all, they had to pass through three thermoscans as they walked through the airport, according to airport authorities. As they queued to board buses, workers in protective clothing disinfected their luggage."We can assure everyone that all our measures are systematic and meet international standards," said the airport's deputy general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn.Chinese tourists were seen putting on raincoats as the last step before leaving for their quarantine accommodation. Kittipong said this was not a government requirement, but rather, he said, the raincoats appeared to have been part of a complimentary package of items from their hotel.Almost 40 million people visited Thailand in 2019, with tourism accounting for more than 10 percent of the country's GDP. But the halting of international flights in early April, due to the pandemic, has left the sector in dire straits. Well-known tourist spots, used to hordes of visitors, are now almost empty, as are the country's famous sandy beaches.More flights are scheduled for tourists on special visas in the coming weeks.(Cover: Chinese tourists from Shanghai arrive at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, October 20, 2020. /AP)Thailand welcomed its first foreign tourists in seven months on Tuesday, bringing a tiny ray of hope to a vital industry that has been brought to its knees by the coronavirus crisis.Thirty-nine Chinese tourists flew into Suvarnabhumi Airport on the outskirts of Bangkok on a Spring Airlines flight from Shanghai.

The director is a woman, Liana Ceterchi. "Each one of us is a facet of Ana Novac's soul and memory," Morgenstern said. The play's author, born Zimra Harsanyi, hails from Romania's northern Transylvania region. She was deported at age 14. The diary she kept inside a Nazi concentration camp was first published in Hungary in 1966 and later translated into several languages, but it only hit bookshelves in her home country in 2004. Many liken Novac's work to that of Anne Frank, author of the "The Diary of a Young Girl," which documented her life in hiding in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands before she was deported to concentration camps. "We are bearers of scars from wounds that are not directly ours, but still we carry these scars," Morgenstern said. She stressed the importance of evoking events through theatrical performance "in order to understand the ghosts of a painful past, the memories of terrible events that have split the world into executioners and victims."Actresses wear the striped outfits of concentration camps against a backdrop of images depicting camp entrances, gas chambers and empty sleeping quarters. Photographs and names of Holocaust victims scroll in a video over the stage and performers. The performers also hold human bones and a skull during monologues. The pandemic has had a severe impact on Romania's artistic community, triggering the closure of theaters during the lockdown. Later, theaters were allowed to hold performances only outdoors, then indoors with a limited number of spectators. "These are existential and also moral questions. What to do to protect life, not to be a threat but at the same time continue our existence and activity and maintain our status as artists?" Morgenstern said.(With input from AP)(Cover image: Actresses of the Jewish State Theater in Bucharest, wearing face masks for protection against COVID-19, perform during rehearsals for the premiere of "The Beautiful Days of My Youth," based on the diary of Romanian Jewish Holocaust survivor Ana Novac. /AP)The latest premiere at the Jewish State Theater in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, explores the horrors of the Holocaust via a survivor's memories of the Auschwitz and Plaszow concentration camps. Friday's debut of "The Beautiful Days of My Youth" by Romanian Jewish Holocaust survivor Ana Novac follows the National Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorations on October 9, the day when deportations of Romania's Jews and Roma began in 1941. Some 280,000 Jews and 11,000 Roma were deported and killed under Romania's pro-Nazi regime during World War II.The play premiered online and in front of spectators who took up less than a third of the seats because of measures meant to slow the coronavirus pandemic in the eastern European nation. Maia Morgenstern, head of the Jewish State Theater and a Romanian Jewish actress best known for playing Mary in Mel Gibson's controversial 2004 movie "The Passion of the Christ," described the play's staging as an "all-female project."

among those presenting honors to pandemic-era student filmmakers.The Student Academy Awards are a key program of the Hollywood film industry's top body, which has already delayed next year's Oscars as speculation builds that the glitzy main ceremony may also take place remotely."I'm hopeful, as we all are, that this will also be the last virtual Student Academy Awards," said Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president David Rubin, signaling desire that the industry can soon return to normal."Just as inflection points like the Cold War and 9/11 shaped the perspective of past generations of filmmakers from Stanley Kramer to Kathryn Bigelow, 2020 â a year like no other â will no doubt forever influence what your generation sees through the camera lens."Students honored at the online ceremony described how lockdowns around the world had affected their finishing touches to movies shot as part of their academic programs."I did change the sound of what my film would have been," said Pilar Garcia-Fernandezsesma, who won the top animation prize for her film "Ciervo" after moving back in with her parents."I ended up putting flute in my film, when I probably wouldn't have done, because I had access to my middle school flute lying around in my bedroom."Allison Waite, honored for her documentary about a Black teen shot dead in a Los Angeles convenience store, said despite the challenges of the pandemic, "being silent at this moment was not productive.""With things happening in the US, with George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, there's so much discussion to be had,"

Claude Monet masterpiece was sold in London on Wednesday for about 7.5 million pounds (about $9.8 million), the second highest price at auction for the mysterious artist.The oil on canvas work, "Show Me the Monet," a modern take on Monet's impressionist classic "The Water-Lily Pond," was sold at Sotheby's following a bidding battle."The hammer came down after five determined collectors battled for nearly nine minutes to drive the final price beyond its estimate of 3,000,000-5,000,000 pounds to become the second highest price for the artist at auction," Sotheby's said.The sale comes a year after a Banksy painting depicting the British parliament populated by chimpanzees smashed the record for the street artist by fetching nearly 9.9 million pounds.On that occasion, the 2009 work titled "Devolved Parliament" attracted a 13-minute battle between 10 different bidders."Show Me the Monet" was created in 2005, as part of a collection called "The Crude Oils" and had first been shown publicly in only Banksy's second gallery exhibition.The painting transforms Monet's masterpiece depicting a Japanese-style bridge in his famous garden at Giverny into a modern-day fly-tipping spot.Instead of an idyllic lily pond, the composition shows discarded shopping trollies and a fluorescent orange traffic cone floating in the water beneath the bridge."Ever prescient as a voice of protest and social dissent, here Banksy shines a light on society's disregard for the environment in favor of the wasteful excesses of consumerism," said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's European Head of Contemporary Art."Recent years have seen seminal Banksys come to auction, but this is one of his strongest, and most iconic, to appear yet," he added.Banksy has become a household name since the turn of the century, after his iconic graffiti paintings began to appear overnight on buildings and at sites around the world.The artist's identity remains shrouded in mystery even as his works have begun to attract increasingly high sums at auction.Meanwhile, he continues to use his art in stunts that generate huge publicity.In 2018, his "Girl With The Balloon" partially shredded itself as the hammer came down at Sotheby's, becoming the re-titled "Love Is In The Bin."(Cover: A visitor looks at Banksy's 'Show me the Monet' on display at Sotheby's in central London, UK, September 18, 2020. /CFP)An

Instead of sashes, buttons are commonly used. Coming up is the most debated one: The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) ensemble. It looks quite similar to hanfu, the traditional costume for Han Chinese, but it also breaks a few rules. The collar should lap for both men and women. The sleeves should be long and wide to meet the two words: kuan and he. Sashes should be used instead of buttons. As for Western clothing, the men's jacket is a typical example. Tailoring requires a proper fit for the individual achieved with cutting and seams. The Vietnamese ao dai, or Vietnamese long dress, is often thought to be related to hanfu, but it is more like a qipao.  The tunic is fitted with a stand-up collar fastened with buttons. It's the national costume of Vietnam. Very similar to the ao dai, the blue dress is a traditional costume mostly seen in Southern China.  The outfit does include hanfu design elements, but essentially, it is also an outfit with Western influence. The dress uses Western dimensional cutting, and its collar disqualifies it from being hanfu. Now, can you spot the differences? Read more:Tradition goes modern: What the Chinese Hanfu clothing system is all aboutWhen talking about traditional Chinese clothing, the tangzhuang (Tang suit) and the qipao (cheongsam) are probably the two best-known styles, but hanfu experts and enthusiasts insist they are not authentic. Even though they have kept traditional Chinese motifs, Western tailoring is used in the garments instead of hanfu's  plain cutting on just one piece of fabric.  Referring back to the first episode where we have talked about the eight characteristics of hanfu, they are "ping zhong jiao you, kuan tuan he ying."  In comparison, the shoulders of the tangzhuang and qipao are designed to fit.

"Christmas itself will come, but how merry it will be, that's the question mark."Finland escaped the worst effects of the pandemic in spring, opting for a strict lockdown, which included isolating the capital, Helsinki.Now, as in much of Europe, infections are on the rise again, hitting a daily record earlier this month, and the government is considering new measures to contain the spread of the virus.The country of 5.5 million people has reported nearly 13,000 COVID-19 infections in total so far, including 346 deaths.With Santa greeting kids from behind a Plexiglas screen and elves wearing masks, Christmas cheer is already in short supply.At tour company Safarctica, which offers snowmobile tours and ice-swimming, sales director Antti Antikainen, reckons bookings are set to fall 50-80 percent this year, adding: "I think it's closer to 80 percent.âTourism-oriented firms, which employ around 8% of people in the region, have already started laying off workers and many have little hope that the festive season can be saved, unless the government eases some of its travel restrictions soon."At this very moment my answer would be that Christmas is cancelled," said Harri Mallinen, who runs the Apukka Resort in Rovaniemi.Christmas is coming, but in Santa's home village in northern Finland, the COVID pandemic means that the flocks of tourists who usually start to make merry in Rovaniemi at this time of year are not.Finland has adopted some of the strictest travel restrictions in Europe, despite its low level of infections, meaning most foreigners cannot enter the country.The northern part of Finland, where many businesses rely on tourists flying in to meet Santa Claus, see the Northern Lights or take a snowmobile safari, has seen visitor numbers plummet.In August 2020, foreign tourist numbers were down 78 percent from a year earlier, according to travel industry data from Business Finland."For local businesses, definitely, Christmas is in danger," Sanna Karkkainen, managing director of Visit Rovaniemi tourist board, said.

As the camera was introduced to China in the mid-19th century, also the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), studies and researches are carried out in a more in-depth way.At a preview of an upcoming photograph auction held by Yingyi Auction House, part of the Chinese history and people's lives in the past 180 years is revealed. The barber, the courtroom, and women with bound feet were some of China's iconic images through the lens of Western photographers in the 19th century.David Knox Griffith's four books of photographs taken in China during the late Qing Dynasty are considered the highlight. As a photographer and co-founder of a studio in Shanghai, Griffith has recorded different aspects of city life across the country since the 1870s."This is the first time we have discovered such a big body of work by the British photographer, David Knox Griffith," said Li Yi, general manager of Yingyi Auctions. "The pictures he took in Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao in the late 19th century are valuable records for studying Chinese history. We can also see clear clues of the photographer's career development through these four books of pictures," Li added.Contemporary photography is quite different. Modern artistic expressions and techniques are merged into a series featuring gardens in the city of Suzhou by Chinese photographer Hong Lei."They appear in the form of photographs, but the artist has actually re-created on the original pieces two or even three times, by hand coloring it, or sanding it to reflect changes in history," said Li.The most important element in contemporary art is the artist's inspiration and ideas in creation. It's quite different from the documentary type, which just captures real moments in life, Li concluded.(Cover: A picture of three women in the late Qing Dynasty, photographer unknown. /CGTN)The history of China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing, has long been studied by scholars and history fans around the world.

An interesting change for Chinese fashion this year is plenty of Chinese elements in garments, some of which are even intended for export.Ten-year-old clothing firm Hemu has always labeled itself a Chinese-style brand, and their new designs for this season's Shanghai Fashion Week have been inspired by one of the oldest Chinese classics, the "Classics of Mountains and Rivers" (Shan Hai Jing). The ancient book tells stories of mythic geography and beasts, and the designer has brought it all into his new collections, aimed primarily at young Chinese."The fashion industry can speak for Chinese culture. Though there are more foreign markets that like Chinese designs, that market still needs to be further developed. Our major consumers are still domestic buyers who love Eastern culture and traditional Chinese handcrafts," said Yang Fengrui, founder of Hemu.Hemu is not the only Chinese brand that is focusing on China Chic. Five-year-old Mukzin is running a special show this year, with designs inspired by traditional clothing from China's Qinghai Province. Plenty of the younger customers were pretty excited by the traditional Chinese elements on the show.Local buyers' enthusiasm for China Chic is reflected in the number of orders Mukzin has received since the show opened a week ago - they're up 70 percent from this season a year ago. The company's CEO said that one of the crucial reasons for the increasing popularity of Chinese-style clothing is the widespread popularity of traditional culture in modern film and television programs."TV dramas and TV shows have a large impact on the young. There are costume dramas and reality shows such as The Rap of China and Street Dance of China. Contestants' performances have Chinese cultural elements, and all of that has a subtle impact on consumers," said George Feng, CEO of Mukzin.Chinese elements were very prominent in the new designs debuted at this season's Shanghai Fashion Week. By showing them off at the fashion gala, the Chinese-style clothing is expected to draw in a wider range of international customers.Shanghai's Spring and Summer 2021 Fashion Week is now presenting the city's fashionistas with plenty of new design debuts.

Many stories depict farmers, describing the significant transformation of China's rural areas over the past 40 years and reflecting the twists and turns of their spiritual sublimation in the transformation.China's first rural-themed TV series, "Three Families," aired on China Central Television on May 22, 1978, marked the beginning of the development of TV series in the new era, which is also a reflection of the reform and opening-up of the countryside.The story of the three families revolves around a 100 yuan loan (about $63.4 back then). One of the families needs the money for their pig farm and one for their child's wedding. In those days, as little as 100 yuan could cause a big problem for the whole family.Since the middle and late 1980s, rural teleplays began to focus on the spiritual impact and transformation of farmers in the early stage of this historic transformation.Adapted from Han Zhijun's novel "Destiny Quartet," three-part TV drama "Rural Trilogy" has a different emphasis. The work not only describes the remarkable changes brought by the reform and opening-up of the countryside but also offers an in-depth look at how people deal with the challenges of adjusting to new modern values.Since 2003, rural-themed teleplays have ushered in the creation of the second bumper period. âLiu Laogen," "Ma Dashuai" and many other TV series are beginning to focus on migrant workers in cities. Many TV series have also started to gather stars to portray the roles that appeal to many viewers.Driven by the national strategy of lifting people out of poverty in all respects by 2020, there is still room for further exploration in the development of rural teleplays. Many of the themes focus on the impact of the nation's policies. More than that, TV shows are no longer limited by subject matter or time and have started to set their stories in a longer historical context."The Ordinary World," "White Deer Plain" and "The Old Farmer" combine the rural theme with drama narration, which adds a historical background and ideological depth to the works.(Top image designer: Pan Yufei.)The content changes of rural-themed teleplays are closely related to the history of rural reform and poverty alleviation in China.2020 is the year for China to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, which means that the root of poverty that has held Chinese people back for thousands of years will be cut off.In this great historical process, many TV series have been paying close attention to the countryside.

When did it begin? How is it being expressed? And how far will it go? You may find the answers in this special exhibition entitled, "Immaterial/Re-material: A Brief History of Computing Art" at the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.The past, present and future of computing art. This group exhibition at Beijing's UCCA has gathered more than 70 pieces by more than 30 artists from around the world, from pioneers of the 1960s to today's emerging voices. "The exhibition at UCCA is by far the largest exhibition dedicated to digital art so far, and I'm very proud that we present four generations of digital artists, of artists who invented new forms and new images to express a new vision of the world," Jerome Neutres, the curator, said in a prerecorded video at the opening.The title "Immaterial/Re-Material" pays tribute to Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard's groundbreaking 1985 exhibition "Les ImmatÃ©riaux," which conceived a new mode of art that reflected the decade's advances in telecommunications technology. By exploring the broad possibilities of computing art and the philosophies underpinning it, the exhibition aims to present the medium not just as a new media form but an entire artistic language.Interactive installations and AI learning is a recurring theme for participating artists.In this "Eye Calligraphy Project," artist Michel Paysant paints with his eyes using his eye tracker connected to an industrial robot equipped with a calligraphy brush. The force of thought and interior design help to realize the "digital calligraphies" of a new generation. Amid the global pandemic, artists believe that exploring computing art is a fitting topic, as technology has more closely connected us."What interests me most is taking this thing that exists in the digital world and bringing it into reality and presenting it as something that viewers can observe many different angles. So, it's not about imagery. It is not about text; it's really about something deeper that we respond to," said Leo Villareal, one of the participating artists."I think that's what we need right now in the world, things that bind us together, things that we can all connect to. So, that's where my work comes from, and I hope that it can help to dissolve some of these boundaries and some of the divisions we're experiencing in the world today."The exhibition runs until January 17, 2021. Computing art is gaining recognition as another medium of artistic expression.

So, that's where my work comes from, and I hope that it can help to dissolve some of these boundaries and some of the divisions we're experiencing in the world today."The exhibition runs until January 17, 2021. Tim Yip, also known as Ye Jintian, the world-renowned art director, visual artist, stage and costume designer as well as the first Chinese to win an Academy Award, shared his views on arts and films with CGTN during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF) in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.'Films and arts are inseparable'Tim Yip has worked with many influential film directors and artists across the globe and is an Academy Award-winning art director. Once depicting himself as the artist who really loves movies, he believes that films and art are inseparable.He won an Oscar for the best art direction in the martial arts blockbuster "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in 2001, making him more outstanding in the film industry than in other fields like theater, costume design and visual arts which he is also good at.Yip said before shooting this film, he spent a long time studying the art of dance in different dynasties in ancient China, and held many exhibitions as well as participated in many large-scale arts festivals in Europe."Films and arts are inseparable," he said, adding that he would spend a lot of time understanding how the director sees the world, which helps him decipher what kind of a world they would like to see. And after that, he will try to find the most lively and diverse ways to present what directors try to express in the film work.As for how Chinese cinema can become more international, Yip told CGTN that when the Chinese outshine foreign directors in arts, they will shoot films others can't compete with.He also said that director Wim Wenders is one of the famous directors in the world that has a great influence on his creation and personality. Inspired by the way he shot his notable documentary "Notebook On Cities &amp; Clothes (1989)," he noted that Wenders has changed the way to approach film documentaries. For example, the film "The Salt of the Earth" was shot in a dramatic way by presenting many striking photos.Apart from dedicating himself to the film industry, Yip has held many exhibitions showcasing his costumes, photographs, installations and videos across the globe. Yip once pointed out the concept of "New Orientalism" aesthetic, which has spanned across films, dance, theater and opera, and it is about conveying the aesthetic of unique Chinese culture to the international world."The 'New Orientalism' concept is not restricted to culture, it is open to all fields," he explained. "I have done a lot of study on the Chinese philosophy about 'Xu Shi Bing Zhi,' it is something like the existence and non-existence can come together."'The pandemic gives me more time to think'The COVID-19 pandemic might have badly hit the global film industry, but it has prompted many people to calm down and rethink the world and life."The pandemic on the other hand, gives me more time to think," he said, adding that prior to COVID-19, the world was moving at breakneck speed, forcing people to do many things at the same time. It was propelling people to rush forward. "While in the pandemic era, I have been forced to calm down and appreciate the depths of time."When it comes to what efforts should be made to adapt to climate change in the post-pandemic era, Yip noted that we should do something for our planet. When he was once invited to visit Norway, he said they could see shrinking glaciers, and they looked like "corpses" because there was electronic and kitchen waste in the water, which was a very serious matter. Reporter: She Jingwei Videographer: Danzeng Jiancuo Video editor: Chen ShiTim Yip, also known as Ye Jintian, the world-renowned art director, visual artist, stage and costume designer as well as the first Chinese to win an Academy Award, shared his views on arts and films with CGTN during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF) in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.'Films and arts are inseparable'Tim Yip has worked with many influential film directors and artists across the globe and is an Academy Award-winning art director.

Established in August 1958, Western Film Group, also known as Xi'an Film Studio, is one of the six major film groups in China.Among the national film production units, Xi'an Film Studio was the first to win the highest awards at international A-level film festivals. It has won more than 300 domestic and foreign awards, including Golden Palm Award, Golden Bear Award, Silver Lion Award in Cannes International Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival and Venice International Film, leading the country. It also has the most number of film exports in the country. Some of its representative films include "Farewell My Concubine," "Old Well," "Red Sorghum," "Tuya's Marriage," "Beautiful Feet," "My 1919," and "A Chinese Odyssey" series. Moreover, a large number of top Chinese directors and movie stars have worked with Xi'an Film Studio, such as Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, Gu Changwei, Gong Li and Chen Chong.The Belt and Road in Film PostersDuring the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF), Xi'an Film Studio is hosting several forums and events, including an exhibition titled "The Belt and Road in Film Posters." On display are a range of original film posters collected by the studio from all over the world in the past five years. The design, aesthetics and psychology of the posters reflect the nature of the films as well as the times in which they were released. At the same time, these posters reflect the hundred-year history of the ever-changing film industry.The exhibition is divided into five sections: The Earliest Film Posters, European and American Film Posters, Original Drawn Posters, Hong Kong Film Posters, and Xi'an Film Studio Classic Film Posters.The Earliest Film PostersThese film posters originated from commercial posters. There were hand-painted or lithographic-printed in the beginning. Painted in original colors, they have different sizes, from extra small to extra large. This exhibition has the smallest movie poster in the world, about 6 square cm, as well as the largest poster in the world, composed of two A0 posters.In the early 20th century, Thomas Edison united many studios to form a film patent alliance, which established the earliest specifications and standards for film posters.In this context, also on display is the incorrect version of the poster of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" â it shows Snow White with six dwarfs.European and American Film PostersIt also features various styles of posters from Europe and the U.S., such as classic Hollywood, surrealism and so on. With increasing cultural exchanges, the artistic styles of film posters influenced each other, thereby enriching the artistry of film posters.In this section, Xi'an Film Studio has created special corners for Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe and the film "Singin' in the Rain."It also exhibits the scooter that Audrey Hepburn rode with Gregory Peck in "Roman Holiday," brought all the way from Italy to Xi'an.Also on display is the most beautiful movie poster in the world â a poster designed by German artist Heinz for the classic silent film "Metropolis."Original Drawn PostersAs film posters were originally hand-painted â vivid with a strong sense of storytelling â many became collectible items. Appreciating a hand-painted film poster is just like appreciating a painting.Hong Kong Film PostersHong Kong Film Posters have their unique regional style. Because of the limited cinema space, these posters are usually small with superimposed pictures of the featuring artists. This is specially true for martial arts films made in Hong Kong, as the well-known Shaw Brothers Pictures, Golden Harvest Pictures and the likes brought Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and other such famous names to fame.Xi'an Film Studio Classic Film PostersXi'an Film Studio has a time-honored legacy and intentional reputation of winning more than 300 awards from China and abroad. It has ushered Chinese films to the world and was the cradle of the fifth generation of directors in China. Many posters created for those classic films produced by Xi'an Film Studio have been exhibited.Car and Film ExhibitionCars and films, two great gifts of the 19th century, have had a tremendous impact on human society. Cars change people's speed of travel, while films affect people's thoughts. When cars drive into films, they are not only props, but also vivid characters showing speed and passion, romance and elegance, technology and innovation. All sorts of classic cars exhibited at Xi'an Film Studio museum have participated in films made by the studio, such as "The Xi'an Incident."The Cine Film LibraryThe Cine Film Library stores a large number of films, including clip materials, formal copies and magnetic recording, serving as a hub of storage, protection, restoration and loan. So far, the library has collected various genres of films and resources, totaling 18,356 copies, including 9,595 copies of material, 6,875 copies of remaining clips and 1,886 copies of magnetic recording.Experiencing 'A Chinese Odyssey'The most fun part of the exhibition is a tour to experience "A Chinese Odyssey", allowing audiences to interact with characters in the movie and go through classic scenes in the movie, such as Bak Jing-Jing's horrifying skeleton hole, almost like a mini version of Universal. A Chinese Odyssey is a two-part 1995 Hong Kong fantasy-comedy film directed by Jeffery Lau and starring Stephen Chow. The film is very loosely based on the 16th-century Wu Cheng'en novel "Journey to the West." Most of the movie scenes were shot in Xi'an Film Studio.This exhibition is a heaven for film lovers and even for escape-room game fans (the Odyssey part). If you have plans to visit Xi'an, definitely put Xi'an Film Studio on your visit list.Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, is the starting point for Chinese films going global since the country's reform and opening-up.

What some might herald as triumphant regeneration can seem to others like a triumphalist celebration of power; well-meaning schemes to clean up deprived areas can often sweep away what made them vibrant neighborhoods to begin with. There is also the question of taste and style, and the inherent problems when changing fashions are applied not to clothing but to buildings, which should be rather more permanent but are often victim to the sweeping statements of incoming ideologues. Infamously, the Modernist-influenced reconstruction of social housing in the third quarter of the 20th century in the UK especially raised unloved "streets in the sky" by razing the sort of centrally located terraced houses that are now highly prized, and therefore highly expensive, as family homes.   However, those allegedly Modernist high-rises owed much less to architectural idealism than they did to manufacturing opportunism, in particular the cheap modular techniques keenly adopted by cash-conscious authorities. When cheap construction caused expensive problems â many 1960s projects have required extensive renovation or expensive replacement â the blame was laid upon the idea rather than the practice, the form rather than the content. It needn't be that way, and perhaps the impending "green" renovation of Europe's ageing building stock can be based upon more permanent foundations, conceived with the longest-term plans in mind. Reconstruction timeOn September 16, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the EU's new Green Deal would have high ideals. While one major strand of the ecological plan â to cut carbon emissions by 55 percent before 2030 â was reducing vehicle emissions, Von der Leyen was also eyeing the very architecture of Europe. "Our buildings generate 40 percent of our emissions," she noted. "They need to become less wasteful, less expensive and more sustainable. We know that the construction sector can even be turned from a carbon source into a carbon sink, if organic building materials like wood and smart technologies like AI are applied."The aims are eye-wateringly large. According to the EU's stocktaking, "more than 220 million buildings, representing approximately 85 percent of the building stock, were built before 2001." Europe has a lot of buildings, but the European Union has a lot of money to throw at them â the cost of the Green Deal has been estimated as at least $1.18 trillion as Europe aims to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.   One proposed schedule for the "Renovation Wave" of retrofitting buildings would update 2 percent of the continent's building stock every year. Building work on such a huge scale represents an enormous risk â or opportunity. As Von der Leyen said: "This is not just an environmental or economic project, it needs to be a new cultural project for Europe." Luckily, Europe is rich in cultural history, and has done this sort of thing before â which is where the Bauhaus idea comes in. "Every movement has its own look and feel," said Von der Leyen, "and we need to give our systemic change its own distinct aesthetic â to match style with sustainability. "This is why we will set up a new European Bauhaus â a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers [and] designers work together to make that happen." A 'new Bauhaus'But what exactly is this new Bauhaus? According to Von der Leyen: "The New European Bauhaus movement is intended to be a bridge between the world of science and technology and the world of art and culture. It is about a new European Green Deal aesthetic combining good design with sustainability."Wednesday's parliamentary question-and-answer session attempted to set out more details, although some of the answers raised yet more questions. The new Bauhaus "will be an interdisciplinary project, co-steered by an advisory board of external experts including scientists, architects, designers, artists, planners and civil society that will create experimental spaces where art, culture, science and technology can imagine, test and demonstrate new solutions."So far, so inclusive. The expansive ideals will go across multiple disciplines: "All Bauhaus projects would deal with the built environment as a whole but would focus on different aspects, such as climate challenges, accessibility, social cohesion, digital construction, sustainable bio-resources etc... and be in different countries."  As such, the new Bauhaus is described as an "accelerator for affordable and aesthetically promising green and digital solutions, technologies and products." Welcoming proposals, the Commission will "conduct a broad participatory co-creation process."For the time being, then, it is something of a talking shop as it attempts to create a unified ethos and aesthetic from the notoriously competitive world of architecture. There may be a lot of discussion before we start to see a style emerging. But that's not to say the project is heading into a slow death by eternal committee: there is a timeline, and there are even construction plans set in stone, if not environmentally unfriendly concrete. That "broad participatory co-creation process" will only last until summer 2021, with "delivery" starting in the second half of 2021. Intriguingly, the Commission mentions "the setting up of a network of five founding Bauhaus[es] in 2022." With further expansion possible: "In a second wave, further Bauhaus[es] can be added across the EU and even globally."At this point, the New Bauhaus steps off the drawing board and into the real world. It is described as "a forum for discussion, a space for art and culture, an experimentation lab, an accelerator, a hub for global networks and experts, a contact point for citizens interested in the topic."It seems that the new-Bauhaus idea is not simply a useful branding tool â a quick comparison to a well-known previous conceptual movement â but a reference to an actual building, or buildings. And that's entirely fitting for the heritage of the name. Unlike, say, Art Nouveau or Futurism, the original Bauhaus was literally a school: an art school, founded in Weimar in the aftermath of a world-shaking event.  The old BauhausThat Bauhaus (German for "building house") is now identified as a minimalist style is somewhat ironic given the widespread aims of its founders. Although it was founded by architect Walter Gropius â a year after the end of World War I in 1919 â the Staatliches Bauhaus art school always combined fine arts with crafts and espoused a Gesamtkunstwerk ("comprehensive artwork"), a common aesthetic that intended to unify all the arts. Indeed, Bauhaus output would eventually span architecture, graphic design, interior design, art, typography and industrial design â the latter being entirely fitting for a theory that attempted to marry individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production revolutionizing capitalism. As with the EU's Green Deal, these were high ideals applied to necessary situations. As Gropius put it, "An object is defined by its nature. In order, then, to design it to function correctly â a container, a chair, or a house â one must first of all study its nature: For it must serve its purpose perfectly, that is, it must fulfil its function usefully, be durable, economical, and 'beautiful.'"  That last word perhaps referenced William Morris, the 19th-century English designer whose golden rule was "Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful." For Bauhaus, there was no need to decide between beauty and use, between function and form: the everyday could be rendered sublime through the right marriage of utility and appearance, usually stripped down and presented without artifice.Widely popular across Europe and the world, Bauhaus design was eventually reflected in everything from Wassily chairs to Olivetti typewriters and, most lastingly, Modernist architecture. That the EU has evoked its name is perhaps designed to recall a brief time when the whole continent was united in the thrilling possibilities of a sleek new future with more opportunity than threat. There is, however, a sad end to the Bauhaus tale. In 1933, by which time it had relocated to Berlin, the Bauhaus was closed down by the newly elected Nazi party, for which it represented cosmopolitanism, liberalism and degeneracy. The Nazis had a very different aesthetic, a more traditional and reactionary Romanticist throwback to an illusory golden age. Adolf Hitler encouraged his favored architect Albert Speer to concoct designs for the reconstruction of Berlin as a New Rome, an aesthetically illiterate toy box of domes and triumphal arches, which was never to see the light of day. History proves that not every overarching architectural plan is well received or even well conceived. But in throwing open its doors to the best of new ideas, hopefully the EU's new Bauhaus will help to future-proof the continent's building stock for our new millennium â while putting in place ecological targets to make sure it isn't our last.Grand architectural plans are not always viewed well by history.

But in throwing open its doors to the best of new ideas, hopefully the EU's new Bauhaus will help to future-proof the continent's building stock for our new millennium â while putting in place ecological targets to make sure it isn't our last.You may know KFC. You may know Luosifen (stinky sour snail noodles). But you may have never imagined KFC will sell Luosifen someday.KFC China has announced the launch of a range of pre-packaged, fast-cooking items categorized as "Kaifengcai," which include chicken Luosifen, chicken breast and chicken soup.Starting October 12, KFC stores in 23 Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, have been selling chicken breast and chicken soup, while chicken Luosifen won't be available until October 26.According to KFC China, the "Kaifengcai" series is only designed for take-away and not dine-in. It's aimed at "inviting young people to enjoy hands-on cooking pleasure" via dishes' self-heating packaging, according to the KFC announcement.Originating in Liuzhou, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in the 1970s, Luosifen served as a cheap street snack that people outside of the city knew little about. It was not until 2012 when a hit Chinese food documentary, "A Bite of China," featured it and it became a household name.Combining the elements of dishes made by Han people with those of the Miao and Dong ethnic groups, Luosifen comprises rice noodles boiled with pickled bamboo shoots, dried turnip, fresh vegetables and peanuts in spicy river snail soup. It is sour, spicy, salty, hot and stinky after being boiled.There's been a "fever of Luosifen" in the catering industry in recent years, both inside and outside of China. Many food manufacturers have launched products with Luosifen flavor, such as mooncake and hotpot.Meanwhile, Luosifen worth around 7.5 million yuan (about $1.1 million) was exported from Liuzhou from January to June this year. That's eight times the total export value in 2019.KFC's move marks its latest step in the localization of its menus in China."As a leading fast-food chain, KFC is really quick in making products catering to local flavors. Luosifen is one of the most popular foods among young Chinese people. The KFC certainly hopes to attract more customers through this move," said Zhu Danpeng, an analyst in the Chinese food industry.You may know KFC. You may know Luosifen (stinky sour snail noodles).

earth around 150 million years ago was sold at a Paris auction house on Tuesday for 3 million euros ($3.52 million).The skeleton of the Allosaurus dinosaur, dug up in the U.S. state of Wyoming three years ago, went to an unnamed foreign buyer for well in excess of the 1 million euro starting price."This is a high grade specimen," said Iacopo Briano, a palaeontologist who acted as a consultant to the Binoche et Giquello auction house which conducted the sale.The specimen is unusual because it is so complete: around 70 percent of the bones are present, and they were found aligned with each other, making it easier to reconnect them during the restoration process.The restored skeleton stands 3.5 meters (11 feet) high and 10 meters long. The ribcage bears the marks of what the auctioneers said may have been an attack by a rival Allosaurus or a predator.(Cover: A skeleton of an Allosaurus dinosaur is on display at Drouot auction house on October 12, 2020, in Paris, France. /CFP)The

Thursday, as investors scrambled for a piece of the country's largest listing in three years.The IPO price was set at 135,000 won ($118) and hit the Kospi exchange daily limit of 351,000 won within minutes into the stock open.It had a market capitalization of 10 trillion won ($8.7 billion) putting it among South Korea's top 40 most valuable companies.The listing helps revive the country's IPO activity this year after two subdued years, with volumes rising 51 percent to $2.9 billion so far this year, compared with the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.The Big Hit float also made the seven members of BTS instant multimillionaires with each granted shares worth 18.5 billion won ($16 million) at the debut price.The Billboard Chart topping group, which has a huge global following, accounted for 87.7 percent of the label's revenue in the first half of 2020, according to a regulatory filing.Analysts say the company has proved itself extremely online savvy, using YouTube and social media for market infiltration since in-person performances were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.BTS' first paid online concert in June earned a Guinness World Records

He was 95.His family confirmed Wednesday that Kretzmer died after a long illness with Parkinson's disease at the London home he shared with his second wife, Sybil Sever.Tributes poured in from giants of the London stage, including theatrical producer Cameron Mackintosh, singer Elaine Paige and lyricist Tim Rice."Les Miserables" producer Mackintosh said Kretzmer was instrumental in bringing Victor Hugo's classic tale of defiance and redemption in early 19th century France to the stage in English in October 1985, five years after it had opened in Paris."His wonderful words for Les MisÃ©rables will live on in his memory forever more," he said in a statement.Paying tribute online, lyricist Sir Tim Rice described Kretzmer as a "great lyricist and man of theatre" and "a giant of his trade," adding: "RIP Herbie," while for Paige, he was a "masterful wordsmith."Kretzmer, known as Herbie to his friends, was born in Kroonstad, a small town south of Johannesburg, South Africa, in October 1925. He was one of four sons of Jewish-Lithuanian immigrants who ran a grocery shop and later a prosperous furniture store.From Johannesburg, he moved to Paris in 1953, playing the piano by night in a bar in return for a meal.

He also answered questions on creativity in filmmaking from the press.What do you think of the impact of the pandemic on filmmakers?I believe that some filmmakers will pay attention to public health topics in the future. The pandemic has an impact on all aspects of our lives, not just filmmaking. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, I felt that I and the people around me were very healthy, but now that we are so vulnerable with the pandemic, I hope that with the advancement of science and technology, we can better deal with the pandemic.Most of your movies are related to daily life, does this have anything to do with your perspective on the world?When I recall things in life, there may be some things that are repetitive, not so attractive to put in movies. Sometimes when a small crisis occurs, it will be meaningful to transform it into a movie theme.For example, two people are having dinner in a restaurant and chatting. This is very daily and not interesting to put into a movie. But for example, these two people are a couple and are about to divorce. And this is the last dinner before the divorce. That would be something dramatic enough to put into a movie. It is different from an ordinary dinner, and can convey a meaning.What is your general creative process?I usually have an idea in my mind. It might be a picture or a fragment that appears in my mind. Many times I start with a very small idea. It might stay in my mind for a long time. Some ideas are constantly changing and maturing. If I think these ideas or fragments are suitable for film expression, I will enrich them and turn them into movies. For example, this idea is related to social concerns, can reflect some social problems, and psychologically caters to the needs of the audience, I will turn it into a movie. But some ideas may only have meaning from one angle, and I will not turn this idea into a movie. When creating a screenplay, I will first describe the outline of the story, and I will gradually enrich it during the creation. In the beginning, I would not imagine the end of the film, the screenplay creation would take a long time, I wouldn't start filming before the screenplay is matured. For example, I have an idea of a young man traveling to northern Iran, he might meet a lot of people, and many things might happen. At the beginning, I would not specifically imagine what things would happen, and who is he going to encounter. I would enrich these when writing the screenplay.What is realistic cinema?The word realistic itself has very rich meanings. Some movies are called realistic movies, which are just superficially realistic, not actually realistic. After I worked in the film industry for a while, my understanding of realistic cinema is to pay attention to people's daily lives. This is realistic cinema. I discussed this with directors in China before, for example, a friend of yours called you and said that he hadnât seen you for a long time and wanted to have tea with you. You were very happy when you received the call and you guys chatted over tea happily, he said that he wanted to start a journey. This is daily life, there is no conflict or contradiction, this is not a movie story. But for example, letâs say this friend died suddenly in a car accident during the trip, elements for a movie came into being. We need to find usable fragments from our lives and make artistic creations.You have experiences directing in French and Spanish. How do you master foreign language creation?In my films, I try to show life in Iran as much as possible. Creating films in Persian, expressing the problems of our society is simpler. If I go to other countries, my habits are different, languages are different, and social environments are different. I have made two films abroad but I still feel that art films are closely integrated with society and culture. When I create films for my own country and for my own audience, the job is simpler. In other countries, there might be creative difficulties.How do you deal with the difference between director and audience's perspective over a movie?These two perspectives are difficult to separate. As film directors, we always think about the audiences. Actually, we are the first audiences of our own films. I don't judge in movies, I just convey. For example, in The Past, we have two protagonists, an Iranian and a French. I am an Iranian. In my creation, some of my emotions are closer to the Iranian role. I know how he would think. But for the French, it is not that close. But in the creation of the screenplay, I try not to favor anyone, and do not judge anyone's behavior. The audience should be the one to judge. I will not give audiences my judgment during the filming.How do you balance the commercial success of a film and the pursuit of artistic expression? Movies need to have commercial success on the one hand, and the pursuit of artistic expression on the other. Many artistic films are not liked by the audiences, unfortunately. In many cases, the audiences and the professional film critics are not the same group. Some of my own films are fortunately welcomed by the audiences. I think there are two reasons: one is drama and the other is reality. Both of these can make a film interesting and attractive.Some artistic films have weak plot connections, and the director needs to connect the plots in a realistic narrative so that the audience can relate to their lives in order to attract them. Plots are like pearls in the ocean, we need to string them well to make it work. Arrange them randomly would make the audience feel that these things cannot happen in their daily life, so they won't like them. Expressing life and be full of drama, at the same time, can attract ordinary audiences. And only with dramatic plots that reflect social issues can we achieve artistic success.Asghar Farhadi was born in 1972 in Iran. He became interested in cinema when he was a teenager and started his education in filmmaking by joining the Youth Cinema Society of Esfahan in 1986, where he made 8mm and 16mm short films.

It got critical acclaim inside and outside Iran. Roger Ebert called it "the best picture of the year," and it received both the Golden Bear and the Silver Bear for Best Actor and Best Actress at the Berlin International Film Festival.

Lead actress Berenice Bejo won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival. "The Past"  was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the Best Foreign Language Film and won the National Board of Reviews' Best Foreign Language Film award. The film was also nominated in five categories of the Cesar Film Festival, including Directing, Best Script and Best Actress. His 2016 movie, "The Salesman," won the Best Screenplay Award at the 69th Cannes Film Festival and brought home the second Oscar for Iran in the Best Foreign Language Film category. Two-time Oscar-winning Iranian director Asghar Farhadi shared his knowledge with young Chinese directors in an online masterclass during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF), focusing on realistic cinema in his creative works.

But for example, letâs say this friend died suddenly in a car accident during the trip, elements for a movie came into being. We need to find usable fragments from our lives and make artistic creations.You have experiences directing in French and Spanish. How do you master foreign language creation?In my films, I try to show life in Iran as much as possible. Creating films in Persian, expressing the problems of our society is simpler. If I go to other countries, my habits are different, languages are different, and social environments are different. I have made two films abroad but I still feel that art films are closely integrated with society and culture. When I create films for my own country and for my own audience, the job is simpler. In other countries, there might be creative difficulties.How do you deal with the difference between director and audience's perspective over a movie?These two perspectives are difficult to separate. As film directors, we always think about the audiences. Actually, we are the first audiences of our own films. I don't judge in movies, I just convey. For example, in The Past, we have two protagonists, an Iranian and a French. I am an Iranian. In my creation, some of my emotions are closer to the Iranian role. I know how he would think. But for the French, it is not that close. But in the creation of the screenplay, I try not to favor anyone, and do not judge anyone's behavior. The audience should be the one to judge. I will not give audiences my judgment during the filming.How do you balance the commercial success of a film and the pursuit of artistic expression? Movies need to have commercial success on the one hand, and the pursuit of artistic expression on the other. Many artistic films are not liked by the audiences, unfortunately. In many cases, the audiences and the professional film critics are not the same group. Some of my own films are fortunately welcomed by the audiences. I think there are two reasons: one is drama and the other is reality. Both of these can make a film interesting and attractive.Some artistic films have weak plot connections, and the director needs to connect the plots in a realistic narrative so that the audience can relate to their lives in order to attract them. Plots are like pearls in the ocean, we need to string them well to make it work. Arrange them randomly would make the audience feel that these things cannot happen in their daily life, so they won't like them. Expressing life and be full of drama, at the same time, can attract ordinary audiences. And only with dramatic plots that reflect social issues can we achieve artistic success.Asghar Farhadi was born in 1972 in Iran.

An exhibition in Beijing unravels its mystery and history.These are eye-witnesses of the evolution of Chinese civilization from the third to the ninth century. Rather than curated by chronology or geography, the 200 or so ceramic objects are arranged into four subjects: Anchoret, Sutra, Alchemy and Lions. Each concept represents a significant cultural, social or historical aspect of the period."Anchoret" refers to powerful and influential families who had for generations held important official positions in the Wei, Jin and Northern and Southern dynasties. At the beginning of the third century, the scholar-officer clan, who failed in its pursuit of the official career, grew skeptical of Confucian ethics. "They began pursuing a more philosophical, seclusive way of living, advocating for individual liberation and spiritual freedom.

The trend for colored stones has increased as an asset class by the super rich in recent years.Mined by Russian diamond producer Alrosa, the 14.83-carat diamond was cut from the largest pink crystal ever found in Russia, Sotheby's said."The occurrence of pink diamonds in nature is extremely rare in any size. Only one percent of all pink diamonds are larger than 10-carats," said Gary Schuler, worldwide chairman of Sotheby's jewelry division.Naturally colored diamonds occur because they posses a particular lattice structure that refracts light to produce colored, rather than white, stones.Pink diamonds are both rare and aesthetically highly prized by collectors, analysts say.The gem is being shown in Singapore and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan region before being auctioned in Geneva on November 11.An extremely rare, vivid purple-pink diamond mined in Russia is expected to fetch up to $38 million when it goes under the hammer on November 11, the auction house Sotheby's said on Monday.The oval gem, which is named after the Russian ballet "The Spirit of the Rose," is the largest of its kind to be offered at auction.

Adapted from real events and told through the lens of volleyball legend Lang Ping, it offers a unique glimpse into some of the contentious issues that have compounded her complicated legacy.And therein lies the novelty."'Leap' is distinguished from other patriotic movies in the way that it treats characters in a rather refreshing way while injecting the story with fresh narratives and far-reaching hints," Jing, a movie reviewer who runs his own review website, told CGTN.In recent years, China's entertainment industry has been flooded with movies featuring historical events effusing patriotic sentiments. Making billions in box-office revenues, these movies are beloved by Chinese cinema-goers.While some of these are repetitive, they serve a purpose. "We do need these movies to convey some messages," said Li Jing, another freelance movie reviewer.But "stories need to be told in a way that characters are fully formed," Li explained. "'Leap' is not perfect, but it shows the effort of focusing the narrative on an intricate character."A standard Chinese patriotic movie tends to emphasize individual sacrifices for the collective, but "Leap" did not follow that path, according to Jing. "I believe Peter Ho-sun Chan, the movie director, was more keen on examining the reconciliation between individual fulfillment and collective interests. It transcends the idea that war-time blockbusters are the only type of movies that audiences like."Lang was an indefatigable player in the national women's team when China was just opening up to the outside world in the 1980s. At a time when patriotism was running high and winning sports events on the global stage signified tremendous national pride, Lang and her team secured thrilling victories â including a world championship title and Olympic gold â that still reverberate across the country.After taking up a coaching career in the U.S. and successfully guiding the U.S. national team to notable victories, she returned to China and was determined to lead the struggling Chinese national team back to its peak. But by then, she was no longer just a patriot elated by winning glory for her country, but had become a seasoned, reserved coach accustomed to both victory or defeat.And "Leap" touches on the contentious theme underlying that change: her questioning of China's sports system, where top athletes are required to devote all their energy to their sport but are not prepared for life after their career is over."'Leap' not only acknowledges the fading trend of patriotism in contemporary China, a cause for the loss of spirit that once motivated athletes of older generations, but also hints at Lang's change in attitude towards volleyball as well as the drawbacks of China's sports system," Jing said. "In this respect, Chan approaches these topics with full honesty."Lang suffered permanent injuries due to strenuous training in her early career as an athlete. Even now, she still holds a disability certificate in the U.S.. But before she left China for an overseas coaching career, she was allegedly refused reimbursement for some costly medical bills by the Chinese volleyball association."Chan is very adept at presenting individualism as the product of our time. One of his signature movies in the 1990s, 'Comrades: Almost a Love Story,' depicts a woman who puts her self-interest above others," said Li."In 'Leap,' we can see the unraveling of the same discussion.

One of his principles for filmmaking, as he himself has stated, is "not to give up on making movies that push the boundaries, as long as they don't cross the line."These directors are feeding new blood into China's movie industry.From silver-haired old men to children who just learnt how to speak, people of the Nu ethnic group can sing and dance, and almost all of them are quite talented.

Van Fleet Award, an award celebrating U.S.-Korea relations."We will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women," said the team leader of BTS after receiving the award, referring to the U.S. and South Korea. Many Chinese netizens pointed out that the speech plays up to U.S. netizens, despite the fact that the country played the role of aggressor in the war.Some Chinese fans declared they would stop chasing the K-pop group. According to Reuters, one netizen said on the social media, referring to BTS, "They should not make any money from China.""There were thousands of Chinese soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the war. You are South Korean people and you can say that, but I am Chinese so I decided to be angry and quit the boy band's fan club to express my strong attitude," one BTS fan surnamed Li told Global Times on Sina Weibo on Sunday.It has also led to a change in the way some companies advertise their products in China.Users on popular Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com on Sunday found that BTS-edition smartphone and earphones disappeared from Samsung's official store on the e-commerce platform. However, according to Global Times, a staff member from the store's pre-sales services said that the products are no longer in stock.The same products also disappeared from Samsung's official store on Tmall, another popular e-commerce platform in China.Some netizens on China's Twitter-like platform Sina Weibo applauded the move, with one user commenting "it proves Samsung cares about the Chinese market."Italian sports brand FILA also deleted a promotion post by the band on its Sina Weibo account.In response, China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it had taken note of the related reports, as well as some feedback and comments from Chinese netizens, adding that "looking forward to the future, cherishing peace and promoting friendship should be our common pursuit and worthy of our joint efforts."This year marks the 70th anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-53), also known as the Korean War, with a great number of Chinese people commemorating those who sacrificed their lives during the war.A series of remembrance events were held in recent days with media reporting on October 10 that the Memorial Hall of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in China's border city of Dandong, northeast China's Liaoning Province, had been reopened after renovation.As of press time, the band's management company, Big Hit Entertainment, did not immediately respond.(With input from Global Times, Reuters)(Cover image via CFP)South Korean boyband BTS is facing a barrage of criticism on China's social media after its leader made remarks about the Korean War leading several big-name brands, including Samsung, to apparently distance themselves from the K-pop group in the Chinese market.The leader of BTS, known by the initials RM, upset many people in China with a speech when the band received the General James A.

In 2015, China established the Girls' and Women's Education Award with UNESCO, and Peng mentioned that there are millions of people who devote their life for the education of girls and women in China.  Zhang Guimei is one of them. She is a female teacher who has taught in the poor mountainous areas of Southwest China's Yunnan Province for over 40 years. She established the first full-tuition-free girl high school in China, which helps many young girls from poverty-stricken families receive education. This year, 1.5 billion students have been forced to suspend classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Peng, and this impact on girls is particularly pronounced. We need to find ways to help those girls get back to school so that they won't be left behind due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sixty-three percent of illiterate adults around the world are women, said Peng, and the education of girls and women is of great benefit to the present and the future. China will continue to work with UNESCO to ensure the success of the Girls' and Women's Education Awards from 2021 to 2025, and make greater contributions to promoting girls' and women's education and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, Peng added. Audrey Azoulay, director-general of UNESCO, thanked the Chinese government for supporting the establishment of Girls' and Women's Education Awards. The UNESCO Prize for Girls' and Women's Education honors outstanding and innovative contributions made by individuals, institutions and organizations to advance girls' and women's education. China's First Lady Peng Liyuan, also United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) special envoy for the advancement of girls' and women's education, sent a congratulatory message to the award of UNESCO via a video on October 12. In her message, Peng expressed congratulations to prize-winners from Sri Lanka and Kenya.

Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home. Jason Huth, an English teacher in Beijing, was one who decided not to travel during the holiday. "I chose to stay for a few reasons; partly because I had just got back to Beijing a few weeks ago after being stuck abroad since Chinese New Year, partly because my school strongly advised teachers not to travel too far away from Beijing due to fears of having to quarantine upon return."Many international schools and companies advised staff against travel during the break. Aletta Magrieta Strauss, a Beijing-based art teacher, said she thought this was reasonable. "If there was an outbreak and I had to quarantine as a result, work would not cover the cost. They (international schools) have already lost a lot of money and are still trying to get staff back into China."With many people having extra money to spend due to not traveling earlier in the year, and with the onus being on safety and comfort, high-end hotels saw a boom in business. Of all hotel bookings made on Trip.com during the October holiday, four- and five-star accommodation accounted for nearly half. It's anticipated that the effect will be lasting, as more people get used to the idea of "luxury staycations."This year's October holiday saw a resurgence in domestic tourism, with 637 million trips being recorded in eight days.

Soprano Zhang Liping and baritone He Leiming, both natives of Wuhan, sang with the Chorus of the Wuhan Conservatory of Music and Beijing Music Association Chorus.Earlier this year, the people of Wuhan and of the rest of China fought the coronavirus pandemic with solidarity and eventually won the battle. "We need to remember this time, reflect the disaster, respect lives and honor civilization," said Zou Ye, who composed the eight-movement symphony."'Dedicated to 2020' is the first large-scale (symphony) work paying tribute to the fight against the coronavirus epidemic," said Yu Long, chairman of the Beijing Music Festival Art Committee."The musicians of the Wuhan Philharmonic Orchestra were engaged in non-musical community work during the epidemic. Each musician is like a soldier. Musicians turn musical instruments into weapons on the stage and provide spiritual support for people. They were also soldiers fighting on the front line of the epidemic," he added.Beijing Music Festival hits both offline and onlineUnder the theme "The Music Must Go On," the Beijing Music Festival is offering 20 offline performances and 240 hours of non-stop online audio and video programs through the mobile application BMF Club.This year marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven and to commemorate the musician, 10 young award-winning violinists, including Xie Haoming, Chen Yige and Jiang Yiliang, have been invited to present 10 of Beethoven's violin sonatas on stage from October 12 to 14.The online offerings, a new addition in the wake of the pandemic, include over 2,000 pieces of music as well as specially-made programs.On each of the festival's 10 nights, the program "Nessun dorma" will invite a Chinese opera singer to introduce some great operas spanning from the Baroque period to the 21st century.

Let art and artists get the respect they deserve," he added.The festival will close on October 20 with a concert themed "We Were Born in 2000" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the China Philharmonic Orchestra.

The most dominant is a group called the Han, who make up more than 90 percent of the mainland's population.Traditionally, the Han people had their own distinctive way of life, including the way they dressed. The type of clothing they wear is known as Hanfu, but some also call it Han clothing. The traditional clothing system of Han people is today divided into two phases: ancient and modern.Ancient Hanfu dates back to the time of Yellow Emperor, which is about 4,000 years ago. It had been developing until about 300 or 400 years ago, when the Qing Dynasty's policy on hair and dress code intervened.Later on, it was around the beginning of the 20th century when the country started moving more towards Western-style clothing. Moving forward, modern Hanfu styles refer to outfits that inherit the basic designs of Hanfu, along with more modern elements.These eight words sum up its characteristics and what makes a Hanfu. In Chinese, it says "Ping Zhong Jiao You, Kuan Tuan He Ying."Ping means flat. One of the key elements of Hanfu is that it doesn't have shoulder lines, meaning the outfit uses just one plain cut of fabric.Zhong means centralized. The cutting and tailoring abide by the rule of symmetrical tailoring and stitching.Jiao means the elements of Hanfu are designed to cross and overlap, upholding a belief in traditional Chinese culture: the balance of Yin and Yang.The word "You" is stressed, meaning everything must move to the right, including how the front is closed.The fifth one is Kuan, meaning width. Hanfu outfits have loose-fitting upper sleeves and bottom. It reminds the wearer to walk with grace and to observe etiquettes.Tuan and He refer to the edges and sleeves. The edges have to be neat and clean with no dangling threads, while the sleeves should come together and meet.Last, but not least is the embellishment.

The elderly want to live at home. However, while their children are willing to take care of them, they suffer from lack of time and energy. Virtual nursing homes seem to be providing a solution to the problem.With just one phone call, the nursing home can provide various services for the elderly at home, from buying vegetables and cooking to cleaning, from massage services to accompanying the sick, so that the elderly can enjoy "personal customized elderly care" without leaving home. In the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, there is not a single bed, but it can serve tens of thousands of elderly people.An "information and home care service" platform and an "intelligent elderly care informatization" management platform have been created to incorporate registered elderly people, regardless of their location, according to Qin Tiantian, director of the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District. The system can provide professional and standardized home care services in a timely and accurate manner through big data collection."Although virtual nursing homes are virtual, the services are actually in place," said Qin. "As of now, more than 133,700 elderly people have been registered and hospitalized, and the total number of services has reached 13.79 million.""The combination of internet technology and elderly care services can not only update offline service maps, day care center monitoring and other content in real time, but also retrieve long-term monitoring data such as blood glucose and blood pressure of the elderly," said Liu Mingzhe, a technical engineer at the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District, adding that smart devices such as infrared sensors and voice-activated alarms can also realize "cloud monitoring" for the elderly in their virtual nursing homes."Different from traditional nursing homes, virtual nursing homes are an old-age care service platform built on information technology," said Pan Helin, professor at the Digital Economy Research Institute of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, further pointing out that virtual nursing homes are generally led by the government and integrate nursing institutions and communities."Elderly care resources such as medical service centers and housekeeping services provide various professional services for the elderly through remote diagnosis and treatment and home-based services," he added.The emergence of virtual nursing homes is a result of adapting to the country's social needs â a high degree of population aging and a stage of rapid development. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 2018, China's population of elderly people over 60 years old reached 249 million, accounting for 17.9 percent of the total population, and the pension situation is relatively severe."The comparative advantages of developing virtual nursing homes are very obvious. It can realize the centralized, precise and efficient supply of decentralized nursing resources, which is an effective choice for my country to deal with the impact of population aging," Pan said.Virtual nursing homes are not unexpected. As early as 2007, China's first virtual nursing home care service center was born in Gusu District, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. It mainly provides home-based care services for the elderly, especially empty nesters and the destitute. Today, after more than 10 years of development, Suzhou has formed a mature virtual pension model, which has been replicated and promoted throughout Jiangsu.In recent years, some places are also exploring different forms of virtual nursing homes. For example, Shanghai has vigorously developed an "embedded" elderly care system, creating a "15-minute home elderly care service circle" in urban areas, and launched new types of community elderly care institutions."Virtual nursing homes are all new things in the international arena, lacking mature experience reference, and relying more on our own exploration," Pan said."Current virtual nursing homes are also facing excessive reliance on government purchases, insufficient market activity, and shortage of talents. The bottleneck is that the construction of virtual nursing homes has a long way to go from one to many and from many to excellent," he added.Pan believes that it is necessary to improve relevant laws and regulations, standardize the development of the industry, strengthen the supervision of this new business format, and at the same time, under the principle of inclusiveness and prudence, enhance the tolerance of related enterprises and promote the development of the industry.Some other experts also mentioned that the key difference between virtual nursing homes and general housekeeping services lies in their professionalism and orientation. It is recommended to speed up the training of compound talents with skills in geriatrics, rehabilitation, nursing, psychology, and management, and expand the career development space of senior care service professionals.As the degree of population aging deepens, "virtual nursing homes" â a new model of home care that makes full use of social resources â are becoming the choice of more and more elderly people in China.The Chinese National Development and Reform Commission and 22 other departments jointly issued the "Implementation Opinions on Promoting Capacity Expansion and Quality Improvement of Consumption and Accelerating the Formation of a Strong Domestic Market" on March 13, 2020, proposing to vigorously develop the "internet + social services" consumption model and support the development of community-based virtual nursing homes.Over the past 10 years, virtual nursing homes have been promoted in many places in the country, exhibiting expanding service groups, diversified service content, and prominent intelligent features.

"We had expected to pay tribute to the booming 1920s in the film history and the birth of experimental film through the Pingyao International Film Festival after 100 years," said Jia Zhangke, Chinese film director and the festival's founder, recalling his last year's plan for this year's festival.But the plan was disrupted, as China's film industry was forced to shut down for 178 days due to the coronavirus pandemic. "As an international film festival held after the epidemic, we want to give a film's answer to the public health event," said Jia, "The festival is a manifestation that Chinese film industry workers insist on producing good works despite all odds and having dialogue with the world."That's how the theme of this year's festival, "Only Filmâ¦" comes. Just as it puts on the festival's official website, "Only films can make the darkness bright."Reduced size but high standard remainedAlthough with a reduced size, more than 50 films will be screened in the festival's five sections. Among them, 43 percent are for the world premiere, 89 percent for the Asian premiere, and all of them for the national premiere.The opening film "This is Life" is an anthology of a number of short videos, many of which are filmed by common people about their lives via their phones. The special presentation "So Far So Close," produced by Chinese director Zhang Yang, tells the story of a food deliveryman during the epidemic.The official selection section Crouching Tigers, which presents international directorial debuts or second features, includes "The Whale Boy," winner of the GdA Director's Award at the 17th edition of Venice's Giornate degli Autori, and "Residue," winner of the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Slamdance Film Festival.Section Hidden Dragons, focusing on Chinese emerging talents, has "An Insignificant Affair," winner of the White Mulberry Award for Best First-time Director at the 22nd Far East Film Festival.Presenting films by renowned directors or films in a spotlight, the section Galas includes the opening film of the 77th Venice Film Festival "The TiesLacci," and "The Women Who Ran" and "Hidden Away," which won the Silver Bear for Best Director and the Silver Bear for Best Actor respectively at the 70th Berlin Film Festival.Other sections collect nine films made in Shanxi, and nine films of the Serbian New Wave produced from the 1960s to 1970s in Yugoslavia's era.Since many international film festivals canceled this year, a section used to present the award-winning films of the year was cut off. Instead, more films produced by new talents have been added into Crouching Tigers and Hidden Dragons sections."Under the current situation, we hope to maintain the core competitiveness of the Pingyao International Film Festival, and promotes its core value in helping young directors to develop," said Jia.One thing to notice is that the over 1,000 film-making projects are seeking for promotion this year, twice than the number of the previous year. "It reflects that because of coronavirus, fewer films were filmed outdoor, but more screenplays and programs were written at home," said Jia.The festival, therefore, decided to increase the number of projects to be promoted. "Like other film festivals, the Pingyao International Film Festival experienced the puzzles brought by the pandemic, but we found our own solution," he said.The Pingyao International Film Festival encourages dialogue between non-Western (Chinese, Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, and African) and Western film communities, and fosters communication and collaboration between Chinese and international filmmakers.The 4th Pingyao International Film Festival kicks off in the ancient city of Pingyao, north China's Shanxi Province on Saturday, providing a non-Western film industry's answer to the world in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.This year marks the 125th anniversary of the birth of film.

The special presentation "So Far So Close," produced by Chinese director Zhang Yang, tells the story of a food deliveryman during the epidemic.The official selection section Crouching Tigers, which presents international directorial debuts or second features, includes "The Whale Boy," winner of the GdA Director's Award at the 17th edition of Venice's Giornate degli Autori, and "Residue," winner of the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Slamdance Film Festival.Section Hidden Dragons, focusing on Chinese emerging talents, has "An Insignificant Affair," winner of the White Mulberry Award for Best First-time Director at the 22nd Far East Film Festival.Presenting films by renowned directors or films in a spotlight, the section Galas includes the opening film of the 77th Venice Film Festival "The TiesLacci," and "The Women Who Ran" and "Hidden Away," which won the Silver Bear for Best Director and the Silver Bear for Best Actor respectively at the 70th Berlin Film Festival.Other sections collect nine films made in Shanxi, and nine films of the Serbian New Wave produced from the 1960s to 1970s in Yugoslavia's era.Since many international film festivals canceled this year, a section used to present the award-winning films of the year was cut off. Instead, more films produced by new talents have been added into Crouching Tigers and Hidden Dragons sections."Under the current situation, we hope to maintain the core competitiveness of the Pingyao International Film Festival, and promotes its core value in helping young directors to develop," said Jia.One thing to notice is that the over 1,000 film-making projects are seeking for promotion this year, twice than the number of the previous year. "It reflects that because of coronavirus, fewer films were filmed outdoor, but more screenplays and programs were written at home," said Jia.The festival, therefore, decided to increase the number of projects to be promoted. "Like other film festivals, the Pingyao International Film Festival experienced the puzzles brought by the pandemic, but we found our own solution," he said.The Pingyao International Film Festival encourages dialogue between non-Western (Chinese, Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, and African) and Western film communities, and fosters communication and collaboration between Chinese and international filmmakers.Art lovers can now catch up on the latest pieces created by Chinese and British artists during quarantine in the comfort of their own homes, for instance, to see the ballet "Swan Lake" performed by world-class dancers in bathtubs.The British Council has spearheaded an initiative called "#ConnectedByCreativity" with the ongoing 2020 UK-China Contemporary Culture Festival launched on October 1. The first edition, running through October 21, showcases a glittering cluster of cultural and art works by artists and institutions from both countries as well as collaborations.More than 75 cultural performances and programs of different kinds, ranging from music, theater, dance, film, fashion, literature, architecture and visual art to industry insight events are being shown in cyberspace during the three-week-long festival. Some will be unveiled to the public for the first time.About 50 cultural institutions from the two countries, such as the London-based British Library, Science Museum Group, Tate Modern, and Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as China's Times Museum, have provided a variety of digital content, most of which was created in the time of COVID-19 lockdowns.Noting that the pandemic "impact has been significant" for the cultural and creative industries, Rehana Mughal, arts director for the British Council in China, said that "many artists have found imaginative ways to make powerful work that documents our collective strength during this challenging time." "While people are at home, they're still being able to engage with new forms of culture also made in the lockdown situation," Mughal told CGTN in a previous interview. She believes that the project will also contribute to "the important cultural and educational relationship between two countries."It is the largest ever digital festival of Chinese and UK creativity to have taken place through the British Council, according to Matt Burney, director of British Council China.The British international organization for education and culture partnered with the Department for International Trade of the UK and China's Chengdu Foreign Affairs Office to launch the online China-UK Contemporary Culture Festival, the first of its kind that is dedicated to cultural and creative exchanges between the countries.The festival celebrates the power of arts and culture in connecting people via introducing new artworks to wider audiences in China and the UK, aiming to help strengthen collaboration between artists and cultural institutions from the two countries as they are struggling to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Mughal noted that through the digital project #ConnectedByCreativity, they sought to overcome the challenges artists, institutions and audiences face in connecting to one another at times of social distancing and travel restrictions. "We wanted to ensure we were able to support connection and build trust despite not being in the same room," she added."Adversity can sometimes breed creativity. We felt it was important to mark this moment in history and to share art that has been produced during a pandemic," she said, adding that the online festival would help expand the reach of the art to new audiences from both countries.According to the Council, the event opened earlier on the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, with the main focus on promoting the works from Chinese artists and institutions in the UK. Since Friday, more performances, dialogues and other programs from the UK have been presented online to Chinese audiences.One of the festival's highlights is a collaborative program called "Distant Dialogue," featuring musicians from China and the UK and allowing "followers to come up with ideas to inspire these musicians to make new music," said Burney.Despite physical distancing, he believes from the online communities they are building will come new and inspirational music.The festival also features eye-catching collaborations between artists from two countries, such as acclaimed choreographic production "Samsara" by renowned dancers Aakash Odedra (UK) and Hu Shenyuan (China)."For those people that don't know where to start, it's a very good introduction," said Mughal.(Cover and infographic images designed by Du Chenxin)Art lovers can now catch up on the latest pieces created by Chinese and British artists during quarantine in the comfort of their own homes, for instance, to see the ballet "Swan Lake" performed by world-class dancers in bathtubs.The British Council has spearheaded an initiative called "#ConnectedByCreativity" with the ongoing 2020 UK-China Contemporary Culture Festival launched on October 1.

From all-round scandals to plot-twists, this is an almost unscripted real-life TV show. And this year, drama is being served daily.Train-wreck debates, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the following nomination debacle, President Trump getting, unsurprisingly, infected with COVID-19, and news of his $750 taxes are just examples of how these elections can be tragically juicy. Still, if you have time, disposition, and are curious about the world of American politics and some of the issues that are central in this year's cycle, we leave you some suggestions for the weekend.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionThe Circus: Inside the craziest political campaign on earthThis Showtime series with five seasons is a must. Starting in 2016 with the Primaries and following election, the show is running until today, giving an extraordinary account of the campaign and political world in the U.S. Featuring exclusive interviews and analyses by the show hosts, strategist Mark Mckinnon, and reporters John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, it gives an inside look to the candidates through candid interviews, backstage shots and them following the campaign trail.At the beginning of the show, the crew was following Republican candidate Jeb Bush, brother of former President George W. Bush, when he gets a call asking if he would support Donald Trump if he was the nominee to the White House. Bush's reaction was exactly the same as everyone else in the world, "that's not going to happen." Fate proved us all wrong. Since season 3, the show counts with Alex Wagner, an anchor and correspondent at CBS News, since Mark Halperin left. With episodes being released every week, it is a good way to keep track of what's going on.The Comey Rule   Another Showtime jewel, The Comey Rule was written and directed by Billy Ray, based on the former FBI Director James Comey's book "A Higher Loyalty."Starring Jeff Daniels, from the magnificent "Newsroom," as Comey and Brendan Gleeson as a scary Trump, the two-part event series starts with the investigation into Clinton's emails, their impact on the election, followed by the first months of the Trump presidency, when Comey is fired.Daniels portrays a naÃ¯ve honor-bound Comey. "[Comey] thinks that being right will save him. It won't," said an FBI agent.In the first episode, two Russian agents come on screen, commenting on testing a Twitter article with fake information against Secretary Clinton that reached 300,000 likes. The scene is frightening for feeling so real in today's social media environment.The second part begins with the dread of Trump's victory and possible outcomes.Gleeson's Trump is a solemn representation of the president. His speech and mannerisms are on point and additionally grim. When he says, "it's a terrible thing," an expression that is so Trump-like, it sounds daunting. Their exchanges on screen are always tense and on the verge of intimidation.Like the Washington Post said, watching this show is like "replaying a nightmare while we're still having it."Agent of ChaosAlex Gibney directs HBO's "Agent of Chaos," a two-part documentary focused on alleged Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.In an interview with The Guardian, Gibney explained how the Russian government or business interests tried to sow chaos in the U.S. with disinformation campaigns led by "troll factories" that created divisive campaigns in social media, cyber-attacks, infiltration into state election systems; and supporting the Trump campaign.It's a documentary on how chaos can be weaponized "to amass power."In the episode focusing on Trump and Putin, Gibney noted, "It's all about greed, and avarice, and corruption. The agents of chaos in both countries had common interests."Read more: October surprise: Last-minute plot twists that decided U.S. presidentsKnock Down the House Directed by Rachel Lears, this 2019 Netflix documentary might not seem appropriate for now because is focused on the 2018 mid-terms. But the fact that it is centered around four women running for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, Joe Crowley, and Paula Jean Swearengin, makes it significant.This year, for the first time in the U.S. political history, six women ran for President, and one was nominated for Vice-President â Kamala Harris. Now, more than ever, women are partaking in civic life by running for office and donating. Ocasio-Cortez takes center stage as the cameras follow her "run to win" from the bar where she worked to the Capitol, where she remembers a trip with her father to the same place. "I think I finally did it [make him proud]."Immigration NationSeparation of families, the border wall, and other controversial immigration policies and statements also defined President Trump's tenure, and that is why it is on this list. Even if the topic has been gone from the presidential and VP debates and part of the public discussion.Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz were allowed to accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents for over two years, but when the six-part documentary was about to come out, ICE threatened to block the release of some scenes.Only for this, the show must be watched. Secondly, it is easy to understand why the police would want to erase some footage: detention quotas, "collaterals" being detained because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time not because they committed a crime, and agents saying repeatedly they are "only doing their jobs." This sentence crystallizes their attempts to rationalize pain and suffering, perpetuating a system of terror. The Netflix docuseries includes heart-wrenching testimonials of fathers separated from their children, crying on camera wondering where they are, as the first episode carries the weight of their grief, desolation, anguish. And also the story, perhaps unknown to most, of U.S. army veterans that are deported, after all, it mirrors how being allowed to die for the country doesn't equal the right to live in it.(Cover photo: The Circus official poster.)If there is something that U.S. politics thrives in, it is drama.

least the end of May 2021, the industry's trade association  said Friday, a fresh sign that the 2020-21 season will be a low point for live entertainment in the United States.Shows had first been expected to reopen in early September, a deadline which was put off to the beginning of January.But the Broadway League decided to delay again until May 30, 2021 as the coronavirus continues to rage across the country, as well in New York, which was the first epicenter of the disease in the United States."With nearly 97,000 workers who rely on Broadway for their livelihood and an annual economic impact of $14.8 billion to the city, our membership is committed to re-opening as soon as conditions permit us to do so," Broadway League President Charlotte St Martin said in a statement released Friday.That will mean theaters will have been closed for 14 months, an unprecedented length of time for the lights to be out in Manhattan's showbiz heart, which shuttered its venues on March 12. At the moment of shutdown, there were 31 shows running on Broadway and eight others preparing for opening in the spring."We are working tirelessly with multiple partners on sustaining the industry once we raise our curtains again," St Martin added.Some productions have already thrown in the towel, including the musical "The Snow Queen," as well as "Hangmen" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"Local media outlet NY1 said two of Broadway's biggest draws, "The Lion King" and "The Phantom of the Opera," would not open again until autumn 2021.Broadway, which pulls in $33 million a week in ticket

Our admissions practices are completely fair and lawful. Yale's admissions policies will not change as a result of the filing of this baseless lawsuit. We look forward to defending these policies in court," Yale President Peter Salovey wrote in a statement to campus Thursday evening, the Wall Street Journal reported.In addition, Salovey countered that the DOJ's allegations are based on inaccurate statistics and unwarranted conclusions."DOJ's claim that the proportion of various racial groups admitted to Yale has remained stable for many years. In fact, in the last two decades, the percentage of admitted applicants fluctuated significantly for all groups," said Salovey.The Washington Post reported that a U.S. higher education association called the Justice Department's lawsuit "shocking and disheartening" and accused it of being politically motivated to bring it 26 days before the U.S. presidential election.The issue of race in college admissions in the U.S. has long been controversial, the report said. Supporters say it would bring diversity to education and critics saying the practice gives an unfair advantage to some applicants solely based on the color of their skin.(Cover image from CFP)The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit Thursday against Yale University, accusing the university of violating federal civil rights laws by discriminating against Asian-American and white applicants in favor of applicants of some certain races.According to the Washington Post reported Friday, the U.S. DOJ in the situation of the Yale University admissions after a two-year investigation, pointed out that the school attaches importance to the racial factor in the admission, and is too biased in favor of applicants of certain races, including African-Americans, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islander and some Asian subgroups such as Cambodian, Laotian and Vietnamese.In contrast, among applicants with the same degree, Asian-Americans and whites are only one-eighth to one-quarter as likely to be accepted as African-Americans, the DOJ said, citing data.However, Yale has denied the allegations."I want to be clear: Yale does not discriminate against applicants of any race or ethnicity.

But the public's wrath, fear, and grief are subsiding as this becomes just another case relegated to the annals of domestic violence.A farmer living on picking herbs in remote mountains in northwestern Sichuan Province, Lamu enjoyed sharing everyday life with her nearly 900,000 fans on the popular short video app Douyin. She regularly posted videos of working in the field, cooking for her family and dancing to Tibetan melodies. On camera, she was a happy-go-lucky woman fighting for a better life for her father and two children. But all of that abruptly ended when her former husband, surnamed Tang, broke into her home during one of her livestreaming sessions. Tang doused her in gasoline and then set her alight, burning 90 percent of her body, in addition to stabbing her multiple times. She died on September 30 after 16 days of medical treatment.Lamu's death sparked an outcry among netizens throughout the country as they demanded justice for her. Within a few days, hashtags mentioning her name received more than 420 million views. Nevertheless, the attention has been short-lived in this frenzied era of social media. People are outraged when such atrocities highlighting gender inequality continue to happen, but they soon forget, until the next "Lamu" appears.What went wrong? It seems that people unconsciously understand that such horrendous cases will inevitably happen again and again, and grow accustomed to these whopping numbers: More than 90 million married women in China regularly face domestic violence. Some 157,000 Chinese women commit suicide every year on average, making it one of the few countries where the female suicide rate is higher than it is for males, and among them 60 percent kill themselves because of domestic violence. On average the victims don't call the police until they've been abused at least 35 times."Violence will become the solution where law, morality and negotiation are all out of control," said Wang Fengli, a Beijing-based sociologist who studies domestic violence, during an interview with CGTN.China is a latecomer to having a legal interpretation of family violence. It wasn't until 2001 that physical abuse could be considered a reason to file for divorce. Only in 2016 did China's first anti-domestic violence law come into effect. It helps victims of physical or mental abuse in the family through various means such as restraining orders.But it "has loopholes," said Peng Chun, assistant professor of Peking University Law School. "It covers married couples, cohabitating partners, and other family members, but it does not deal with violence against former spouses or intimate partners who do not live together." As seen in Lamu's case, she was no longer eligible for a protection order because she was divorced, even though she'd been abused and threatened by Tang for a decade.Late last year, He Yuhong, a Chongqing-based beauty blogger who goes by the name Yuyamika, posted a video including surveillance footage that shows her ex-boyfriend violently dragging her from an elevator despite her struggling and yelling for help. "For the past six months, I seem to have been living in a nightmare," she wrote.The challenge in defining what constitutes domestic violence as well as the difficulty in gathering such evidence usually lead to delays in or rejections of issuing personal safety protection orders, according to Peng. In 2019, over 2,000 such orders were granted, triple that in 2016, but that was a far cry considering the hundreds of thousands of victims every year. Plus, the law fails to address sexual abuse or economic control.The gaps in the law and its enforcement aren't the only factors discouraging the abused from seeking justice. There is a deep-rooted mentality best encapsulated by an old Chinese saying, "Even upright officials cannot adjudicate family affairs." Due to this distinction, some police and judges would take family violence a private matter that should be dealt with by the family themselves."Thousands of years of patriarchy means that males are responsible for the fate of a household," said Wang. "In conservative or patriarchal societies, the rates of family violence are higher."This notion of tribal justice extends to cases such as Lamu's, where police only take the matter seriously when it ends in tragedy. Reports say that Lamu went to local police for help multiple times since last year in attempts to get a divorce. The authorities ended up giving Tang verbal warnings instead.Statistics from the All-China Women's Federation show that 80 percent of women calling the police for domestic violence are ignored because they are considered "family affairs" instead of criminal activity. Some of these women were even reprimanded by the police.The more difficult fight, however, lies in changing prejudices against those suffering from domestic violence. Even though Lamu was the victim, a few netizens on Weibo said that she must have done something wrong in her marriage to deserve being beaten, or that she shouldn't have attracted such attention by becoming an Internet celebrity/sensation. Those with this mentality essentially criticize the female victim for displaying too much agency or not living up to certain standards, while diminishing the male aggressor's responsibility.Wang thinks the psychology of victim-blaming is the biggest obstacle in the fight against domestic violence. Lamu is a "perfect victim" in many ways â an independent woman who struggled to divorce twice and supported her family on her own. She was fighting against her ex-husband, his violence and her fate, but she couldn't survive.Tang reportedly beat her not just at home, but overtly in the street. Lukewarm reactions from authorities in that small village ingrained with chauvinistic attitudes only hastened the onset of tragedy.But that can't explain it all. In relatively progressive societies, tragedies still happen. Hong Mei, a 40-year-old journalist who was in particular covering domestic violence in Ordos in Inner Mongolia, suffered violent beatings from her husband for over a decade before she died from abuse in 2016.It's not all gloom and doom. "The number of protection orders issued nationwide is on the rise, which shows that family violence victims are taking the initiative to protect themselves," Feng Yuan, co-founder of Equality, a Beijing-based NGO, told CGTN. In 2016, courts throughout China granted only 687 such orders; the figure rose to 2,004 in 2019.Meanwhile, the supreme court issued guidelines for local courts to reduce the burden of proof on plaintiffs, in consideration of the difficulty in acquiring the substantial evidence of abuse needed to apply for restraining orders.Lamu's tragic ending is part of a story that has been told again and again, as part of a cycle of complicity in which society chooses to ignore and forget simply because it's the easy thing to do. Attitudes toward domestic violence can only change when the public decides that one more incident of abuse is too many.Even now, users on social media lament that Lamu could have escaped death if she hadn't gone down from the mountains. But a world where Lamu could have lived her life without fear wherever she could have chosen to be is a world that we should strive for.(China 24, Zeng Ziyi and Yu Jing contributed reporting.)If you have a story on family violence and want to share it with us, please write to stories@cgtn.com.Also, if you or someone you know is suffering from domestic violence, please call this hotline (China only): 15117905157.It's been barely a week since Lamu, a 30-year-old woman from southwest China, died after being set on fire by her ex-husband.

local media reported Thursday. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, the 11 countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than

countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than three months also being eligible.Eligible travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 before entering Japan and upon arrival in Japan, while their sponsors, such as companies or organizations which support them, will be expected to ensure their self-isolation for 14 days,

for the younger generation, the Strawberry Music Festival (Strawberry), by the independent music label and organizer Modernsky, came back to Beijing on October 5 during the country's Golden Week holiday. It was delayed due to a COVID-19 pandemic that shattered the whole country earlier this year. As the first mega party in the city since, attendees and organizers have pulled out all the stops for the festival. Although the epidemic situation has been significantly improved in China, the festival still took place with strict anti-coronavirus measures: Masks were required throughout the show, body temperature scans were performed at the entrance, disinfection of the venue was carried out throughout the day, etc. As the biggest domestic music festival in China, Modernsky made sure they would not scrimp on talent. The three-day line up featured Chinese singers and bands that have become the focus of attention in recent years: New Pants, Jike Junyi, Vinida, and many others.Miumiu, the six-year-old girl who touched hearts of netizens worldwide with her angelic voice and amazing instrumental skills, was among the artists invited this year. As she stepped on stage as Joyside's special guest, the crowd went crazy. Miumiu - albeit still a kid - is a serious and professional performer when it comes to music. In the half-an-hour-long talk after her show, the agile girl told CGTN how annoyed she gets when her younger brother tries to take away her toys, and of course, how much she loves the Disney animated film "Frozen." Exclusive: CGTN croons with talented guitar girl MiumiuStrawberry 2020 felt more like a family getaway event during the holiday rather than a show only for party goers. Among the crowd were many parents enjoying the buzz with their young kids, showing that the new generation of Chinese parents has their own approach to raising their children.CGTN also came across Deng Ziye, a girl from Wuhan who experienced the worst of COVID-19. She said what she remembered most was the day when Wuhan was locked down and that she "never would've thought something like that would really happen in real life." As a regular attendee of music festivals, Deng was thrilled to come to Strawberry as her first in 2020. She said she now cherishes returning to normalcy and has a different outlook about going to music festivals. "Something that I used to take for granted has suddenly become so precious," Deng said.The pandemic also caused a lot of challenges in the hosting of the event. For example, according to Chen Yunong, the Beijing Strawberry coordinator, they had to reschedule the festival several times and limit the number of attendees to a total of 25,000, whereas in previous years, it would be 100,000. But with the full support from the Beijing government, the festival was held successfully and has provided a benchmark for its peers.The cultural industry alongside with the country's economy is reviving as the COVID-19 pandemic eases in China, and the Strawberry Music Festival is just one of the the latest examples.Cameramen: Wang Zeyu, Wang YananNormally held in April and May as one of China's symbols of "spring" for the younger generation, the Strawberry Music Festival (Strawberry), by the independent music label and organizer Modernsky, came back to Beijing on October 5 during the country's Golden Week holiday.

The designers apply not only the 24 solar terms but also the 72 pentads of the Chinese phenology, which started from Han Dynasty some 2,000 years ago. "The 24 solar terms were inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2016. But the 72 pentads are not known to most people. To us, the 24 solar terms are too broad because the plants change every 5 to 7 days. With the 72 pentads we're able to fix the botanical materials to suit varied needs," said Zhao Sumin, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Gardenscape.Zhao's company grows around 1,500 different kinds of plants. Most of them are imported from the United States. In the past 18 years, she and her workmates have provided services to private and public spaces. However, her biggest wish is to revive the biodiversity in northern China. "I went to Minnesota, the United States in 1991 as a visiting scholar. I found that the private gardens and the whole city were rich in types and colors even in fall and winter. Four years later I started to introduce the greenhouse technology to China and then the work of industrial seedling raising. I realized what China needed the most was to import more colors of the nature, or let's say biodiversity. This is a long-term plan," Zhao said.Her company was designated as the national forestry germplasm source bank in 2006, the only one in Beijing and the only private enterprise of its kind in China. The State Forestry Administration experts were deeply impressed by the more than 110 kinds of Chinese flowering crabapple trees in the garden. "The crabapple trees were from China originally. They were found in a very wide range of areas from Hebei to Yunnan provinces. In the past two to three centuries, they were brought abroad and now there are over 600 kinds of them in the American archive. I chose the types which fruits don't fall in winter so the clients are able to enjoy the flowers in early spring, red and yellow leaves in fall and fruits when it snows. Also birds can eat the fruits in winter," Zhao said.Chinese people's longing for a better environment has been growing strongly in recent years. Gardening is widely applied in urban landscape, parks, expos. companies and houses. Zhao said her biggest wish is that people can go out and embrace nature. And more importantly, respect nature. "Gardening has become a part of Chinese people's lives. We have been working on combining the imported plants with local wild ones. We hope that people can know more about plants and respect them. Our gardens are opened to botanists, designers, families and schools from time to time. Nature has been nurturing humans and we should cherish its contribution and build a healthier ecosystem," she said.Through the sophisticated designs by botanists, Chinese urban dwellers are now able to escape their bustling day-to-day lives, and find some inner peace while at it. At the just concluded Beijing Design Expo, one of the major offline events of the Beijing Design Week, this tiny garden attracted much attention. The stall is just a very small part of the business of the Beijing-based botanical company and seed bank. In its 9 gardens in the outskirts of the city, visitors are able to experience vibrant colors any day of the year.

Sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy in 2017 and forced it to postpone the 2018 prize â a first in 70 years.Two laureates were named last year with the 2018 award going to Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian novelist Peter Handke honored as the 2019 Nobel laureate. Handke's prize unleashed a flood of criticism as the writer is known for supporting Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in the Balkan wars.Gluck would have received the accolade from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.The in-person ceremony, however, has been canceled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It's the first exhibition to open in the British capital since the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lockdown to the UK's public spaces, including art galleries and museums.Getting Nauman's installations in place has taken seven weeks â an unusually long time to set up an exhibition, due to new measures to limit the number of people in the space at any one time. But for curator and former director of Tate Nicholas Serota, the wait was worth it."We've had to take every possible precaution. And, of course, the visitors, when they arrive, will be given every possible safeguard. But it's the most exciting moment to have a new show by a great artist in one of the great museums of the world," Serota said.Nauman's work spans more than 50 years and some themes reoccur over time, such as the human body, lettering and language, and physical and psychological pressure. In a career that defies easy categorization, he has experimented with neons, video installations, sculpture and more.In addition, some works have taken on new meaning in this era of COVID-19. The piece "Hands Washing Normal," for instance, shows someone washing hands vigorously with a lot of soap."This is a piece that was not made this year. It was made in 1996. So Nauman takes these rituals that we all perform and makes us look at them even more carefully. And whatever resonance that piece had in 1996, it certainly has a very different resonance in 2020," said Serota.Nauman may not be as famous as Andy Warhol or Yayoi Kusama, but his impact on the art scene is undeniable. His exploration of the dull, everyday life is what makes this exhibition special, according to art critic for Londonist Tabish Khan."When you first go in, it's slightly strange because you think art is meant to be beautiful or is meant to be inspiring. But here we are celebrating the mundane, the inane, sometimes the slightly awkward, confusing or even disturbing," Khan said."We like to celebrate the moments that are great, but at the same time, it's also filled by moments where nothing actually happens," he added.The exhibition runs until February 21, 2021.(With input from AP)Tate Modern, a modern art gallery in London, launched a new exhibition on Wednesday, displaying a variety of works by American conceptual artist Bruce Nauman. It's the first exhibition to open in the British capital since the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lockdown to the UK's public spaces, including art galleries and museums.Getting Nauman's installations in place has taken seven weeks â an unusually long time to set up an exhibition, due to new measures to limit the number of people in the space at any one time. But for curator and former director of Tate Nicholas Serota, the wait was worth it."We've had to take every possible precaution. And, of course, the visitors, when they arrive, will be given every possible safeguard. But it's the most exciting moment to have a new show by a great artist in one of the great museums of the world," Serota said.Nauman's work spans more than 50 years and some themes reoccur over time, such as the human body, lettering and language, and physical and psychological pressure. In a career that defies easy categorization, he has experimented with neons, video installations, sculpture and more.In addition, some works have taken on new meaning in this era of COVID-19. The piece "Hands Washing Normal," for instance, shows someone washing hands vigorously with a lot of soap."This is a piece that was not made this year. It was made in 1996. So Nauman takes these rituals that we all perform and makes us look at them even more carefully. And whatever resonance that piece had in 1996, it certainly has a very different resonance in 2020," said Serota.Nauman may not be as famous as Andy Warhol or Yayoi Kusama, but his impact on the art scene is undeniable.

Previously, the film was shortlisted at the Cannes Film Festival in 2020 as one of only two finalists among Chinese-language films.The film centers on China's post-90s generation by telling the story of a restless young man named Kun. As he's about to graduate from college, he drops out of the film school and embarks on a journey "marked by restlessness and absurdity, calamity and joy" as introduced on BFI's official website.Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen's "Mangrove" was selected as the opening film to raise the curtain of the festival. It tells the trial of the Mangrove Nine â a group of black activists accused of inciting a riot at a protest â in the 1970s. The movie is the first of the director's five-film series called "Small Axe."A wide range of works from more than 40 countries and regions, including fiction, documentary, animation, artists' moving image, short film and restored classics, will be presented at the festival, according to the LFF agenda.As Britain's leading film event, the LFF introduces new British and international films to London and Britain-wide audience, attracting significant international film industry participation.(With input from Xinhua)(Cover: From left to right are Malachi Kirby, Director Steve McQueen, Rochenda Sandall, Letitia Wright and Shaun Parkes who attend the BFI London Film Festival opening film and premiere of "Mangrove" in London, UK, October 7, 2020. /CFP)The 64th BFI London Film Festival (LFF) opened Wednesday amid rising coronavirus infections across the UK with a total of 58 films from around the world to be delivered both virtually and via physical screenings in the next 12 days.Chinese feature film "Striding into the Wind," directed by Chinese filmmaker Wei Shujun, is among the list of screenings.

She was told by her teacher of a special opportunity to work with helicopters. The project was recruiting students from poor families in Tibet, and she was lucky to be selected as one of them."At the beginning, I was excited and I couldn't believe it," she said.From February 2017, she started her training and learned to operate and maintain helicopters in Jiangsu. Then in March 2018, she graduated, becoming one of the 28 Tibetans who succeeded in being among the first Tibetan pilots to obtain a license.Back in Lhasa, she is now a civil helicopter pilot with the Lhasa Snow Eagle General Aviation. She'll carry tourists and show them around the city of Lhasa, introducing some of its attractions, customs and history. She said it's quite different to see the landmark Potala Palace up in the air than seeing it from the ground."I feel a sense of accomplishment when I take tourists to see Lhasa from the air," she told CGTN.With a pair of aviator sunglasses and a pilot uniform, Janre Yeshi is ready to board the helicopter and show tourists what the city of Lhasa looks like from above.Born and raised in an impoverished family in Lhasa's Dangxiong County, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, the 23-year-old Tibetan girl never imagined that her life could encounter such tremendous transformation.Back in 2016, a poverty alleviation project launched together by the local government and the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu utterly changed her life path.It was around the time of the national college entrance examination when students from across the country were busy preparing for the exam.

A total of 500 works from those young artists are on display, covering a wide range of art forms, including oil painting, traditional Chinese painting, sculpture, installation, video and multimedia. With the theme "IN/OUT," the exhibition is divided into three sections: "fluid society," "natural simulation," and "the deduction of civilization." Through their artworks, young artists express their understanding of nature and their reflection on technology and society. In a multimedia work named "Gaze into Haze," people are able to see multi-layered information like the silhouette of visitors, English words, LEGO and fish in the background, yet none of them can be seen clearly. The artist wants to mirror the information explosion that we are currently experiencing. Another work shows a phone number and there is actually a cell phone hidden inside the installation. When people call the number, it makes disturbing noises."It's difficult for us to stay quiet nowadays. Even if you want peace and quiet, you are easily affected by others. So this work reflects our situation in a plain way," says the creator AIWU.Launched in 2011, Art Nova 100 is an art platform that discovers and promotes young artists. Each year, thousands of young artists in China apply for the program, and around 100 are selected after evaluation from experts.Those artists on the final shortlist are invited to participate in Art Nova 100, which includes exhibitions and forums both in China and abroad, as well as a multi-channel artist promotion program. "Over 100 young artists started their career from this platform. Before we started, many art students would either give up on becoming artists after graduation or stay unknown to the public in small studios," Peng Wei, director of Art Nova 100, said."But I feel proud that in the past nine years since the platform was launched, it has helped many young artists follow their dreams," she added.The Guardian Art Center in Beijing is holding an exhibition to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Art Nova 100, which nominates about 100 artists from across China each year.

It took only 3 years to build, and first went into operation 6 years ago.Chen Xin felt curious and excited when he first boarded a bullet train 6 years ago. He still remembers the day he got into a bullet train cab for the first time. He wasn't allowed to touch the control desk because his teacher was afraid that he might do something wrong and force the train to stop. Now he's become one of the best bullet train drivers in Xinjiang.Before 2011, Chen drove either diesel or electric locomotives. But he says driving bullet trains is very different, and much better."Diesel and electric locomotives don't seal properly. Sand still gets inside, even when the windows are closed," Chen said. He had to clean up the sand or it could have damaged the control desk and other devices in the cabin."Now bullet trains are wind and sand proof. So I can focus on my work, safely taking passengers to their destinations," he added.Xinjiang's first high-speed rail line officially opened in November 2014, connecting the region's capital city Urumqi with Hami, a city in east Xinjiang. The 530-kilometer trip used to take 4-6 hours. Today, it takes only 2.5 hours. Traveling by bullet train has now become a new way of life for the locals.Despite the transformation that high-speed railway has brought to the city, for Chen, one thing hasn't changed. That is the sense of responsibility."No matter what kind of locomotives you're driving, you should stick to your sense of responsibility. You should be responsible for yourself, your passengers, as well as the state property," he told CGTN.Chen has witnessed the railway's development in Xinjiang, from diesel locomotives to electric, and now bullet trains. What impressed him the most are the greater levels of efficiency as well as the working environment.The speed limit for trains in Xinjiang is now two times higher than before and Chen believes it'll be three times faster in the foreseeable future.The bullet train is changing people's way of life in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and boosting the region's economic potential.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

This year's Beijing Design Week launched a special section to promote the application of cultural IP. CGTN went to a newly established platform to see how they are trying to revive classical IP and help young designers.At a cafe by the Forbidden City, visitors can enjoy a moment within a space decorated with the well-known "One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" by Wang Ximeng, and have a taste of royal flavor from the Palace Museum, such as "Kangxi Likes Chocolates." And as a model combining modern design and the traditional culture, Si Shi Ying Wu presents the cooperation between inheritors of intangible cultural heritage and designers.All the paintings on the wall were downloaded from a platform called Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Design."Under the CC0 license, a list of famous museums, including the British Museum, has opened their digital materials to the public for free. This is a great leap in the history of human civilization," Zhao Dongbao, co-founder of CC0 Design, told CGTN."It's a pity that only a few Chinese cultural institutions are cooperating with these international organizations.

It is the first of its kind to develop products based on CC0 license."The CC0 license has mobilized more designers to create their own works based on high-definition digital material," Yu Fei, co-founder of CC0 Design, also Assistant President of Sinofaith Group said. "Since then, a lot of amazing artworks have been produced, which are dynamic and popular and somehow extend the life cycle of museum collections. For some time, we've been discussing how to breathe new life into cultural relics. They shouldn't be kept asleep in museums. We need to let more people learn about them and enjoy them. We hope our designers can find these materials easily, and those precious masterpieces will give them great inspiration," Yu said.It's a hope which resonates with young designers. Chen Hui, a product designer said, "It's difficult for us designers to find materials. We have to search a bunch of websites. This website collects all these materials. It is a user-friendly platform and all of these are free."So far, over 10 museums in the world have adopted the CC0 license. Yu expressed his hope that more domestic museums will open up their digital materials as well, giving designers and related industry more opportunities.(Cover image: A replica of Van Gogh's bedroom in Arles at the Beijing Design Expo. /CGTN )How to make the cultural intellectual property industry flourish is one of the hot topics in the design industry. This year's Beijing Design Week launched a special section to promote the application of cultural IP. CGTN went to a newly established platform to see how they are trying to revive classical IP and help young designers.At a cafe by the Forbidden City, visitors can enjoy a moment within a space decorated with the well-known "One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" by Wang Ximeng, and have a taste of royal flavor from the Palace Museum, such as "Kangxi Likes Chocolates." And as a model combining modern design and the traditional culture, Si Shi Ying Wu presents the cooperation between inheritors of intangible cultural heritage and designers.All the paintings on the wall were downloaded from a platform called Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Design."Under the CC0 license, a list of famous museums, including the British Museum, has opened their digital materials to the public for free. This is a great leap in the history of human civilization," Zhao Dongbao, co-founder of CC0 Design, told CGTN."It's a pity that only a few Chinese cultural institutions are cooperating with these international organizations.

He was 65.A person close to Van Halenâs family confirmed the rocker died Tuesday due to cancer. The person was not authorized to publicly release details in advance of an official announcement."I can't believe I'm having to write this, but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning," Wolf Van Halen wrote in a message on Twitter with a picture of the rocker who was 65."He was the best father I could ever ask for," he added. "Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift."My heart is broken and I don't think I'll ever fully recover from this loss. I love you so much, Pop." Born in the Netherlands and raised in California, Van Halen founded the rock group with his older brother Alex in the early 1970s and quickly earned a fan base.He was famous for what became known as "finger tapping" â playing the guitar with two hands, like a piano.He was also known for his guitars, including one named Frankenstein which he pieced together from part of other instruments.Among the group's classics are "Jump," "Panama," "Runnin' with the Devil," and the guitar solo "Eruption.""Ed's a once- or twice-in-a-century kind of guy. There's Hendrix and there's Eddie Van Halen," friend and guitarist Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains said during Grammy weekend in January 2019. "Those two guys tilted the world on its axis."Van Halen has sold more than 75 million albums and has more number one hits on the mainstream U.S. rock chart than any other artist, according to the band's label. The group's album "1984" was to be the band's high point, giving them their only number one single "Jump."The creative tension within the band boiled over during the "1984" tour, with Eddie Van Halen and original frontman David Lee Roth falling out. Roth left the band in April 1985.One of his gripes with Eddie Van Halen was reportedly the rocker's outside work that included providing the lead-in guitar for Michael Jackson's 1983 smash hit "Beat It." However, Van Halen announced a reunion tour in 2007 with Roth performing with the group for the first time in 22 years.Another tour planned in 2012 had to be cancelled after Eddie Van Halen had to undergo emergency surgery.But the band reunited again in 2015 for an extensive North American tour.Eddie Van Halen was known to have health problems that would interfere with his work for years.He underwent hip surgery in 1999 and had part of his tongue removed in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer, likely because of heavy smoking.Although he was declared cancer free following the surgery, the American tabloid news site TMZ reported earlier this year that he had been going to Germany for throat cancer treatment. His drug abuse and heavy drinking contributed to his 2007 divorce from TV actress Valerie Bertinelli after 16 years of marriage."I was an alcoholic, and I needed alcohol to function," he said in a 2015 interview with Billboard magazine. "I didn't drink to party. Alcohol and cocaine were private things to me. I would use them for work. The blow keeps you awake and the alcohol lowers your inhibitions. I'm sure there were musical things I would not have attempted were I not in that mental state."Tributes from some of the biggest names in the music world poured in Tuesday following news of his death."I'm just devastated to hear the news of the passing of my dear friend Eddie Van Halen. He fought a long and hard battle with his cancer right to the very end. Eddie was one of a very special kind of person, a really great friend. Rest In Peace my dear friend till we meet again," Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi tweeted."Sad to hear Eddie Van Halen has passed away. A guitar innovator with a fierce spirit of musical and technical exploration. Prayers and thoughts with his family and friends," Yusuf/Cat Stevens tweeted.Songwriter Diane Warren said in a tweet that "guitars are gently weeping everywhere.

And, it symbolizes China's highest authority.  As one of many structures built to mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, its design and construction draw wide attention.  In 1954, the first National People's Congress was held, but only  about 1,200 deputies attended the conference due to the small meeting venue. Building a larger meeting place seemed an urgent task. Soon after, CPC Chairman Mao Zedong came up with the idea of building an auditorium for 10,000 people. "The Great Hall of the People was a great breakthrough at that time in terms of scale," said Mi Junren, vice chief architect of the Institute of Architecture and Environmental Art Design. "It was not an easy job to build a structure with a floor area of 170,000 square meters. Another important highlight is the halls inside, such as the grand auditorium, which can hold 10,000 people. There isn't another auditorium as big in the world today. The Great Hall of the People embodies the highest technical level of architecture, acoustics, lighting, and sound." In 1958 and 1959, designers and construction workers from across the nation came to Beijing to work on the project. They were faced with many challenges, including the interior ceiling design of the Grand Auditorium. At last, the proposal given by then premier, Zhou Enlai was adopted. He raised the concept of "Water and sky merge in one color.""The most wonderful design of the auditorium is the ceiling," said Mi. "We can see elements like the pentacle stars, sunflowers, and water ripples. The roof of the building is more than 30 meters above the ground, and if the walls and roof form a right angle, then the roof will appear very small. Premier Zhou Enlai suggested that the roof and walls be integrated to form a cambered surface. With lights turned on, people feel like they're sitting under a vast starry sky."  The columns at the east gate of the building were also a challenge. After construction was completed, then Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen decided that the span between the middle two columns should be larger than the rest, according to Chinese architectural tradition. He insisted on the removal of the 23-meter-high concrete pillars. "The central concrete structure was irremovable, so workers tried to remove the decorative surface to the side. After removing the outer surface, the distance between the middle columns became larger than the rest," Mi said.Construction of The Great Hall of the People was completed in September 1959, right before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.  Although six decades have passed, the building continues to look powerful and solemn on the west side of Tian'anmen Square.  (Cover image: The Great Hall of the People. /VCG)The Great Hall of the People, where major national affairs are discussed and decided, is an architectural treasure on Beijing's Tian'anmen Square.

It's 200 kilometers from the Taklamakan Desert. On this day, CGTN met the archaeological team of the site, the oldest ever excavated in Xinjiang.The rammed construction with barbican entrances is called the Ruins of Luntai City, as well as Kuiyuq Shehayer ancient city, which means "city in ashes." It is there CGTN met Dang Zhihao from the Xinjiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology and the project manager of the city ruins. He's been doing archeological work for decades; this is his second project.The archeologists started working there three-and-a-half years ago. They have since uncovered substantial evidence that this ancient site could be traced as far back as 2,500 years, to as early as 500 BC during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BC)."That is to say, at least starting between the Han Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn era, on the northern rim of Tarim Basin, here stands such a city. It shocked us," said Dang.The site's geographic proximity to the Taklamakan Desert has proven to be an enormous challenge for the archeological team in unfolding this mysterious site as the sand blows relentlessly, covering almost everything in dry dust."Compared with central China, the environment in Xinjiang for archaeological investigation is harsh, which makes our work more difficult. But the charm of our work is constantly updating knowledge about the world with new findings. This allows more people to learn about Xinjiang's history, and love the land more," Dang said.Some wall base relics, embroideries, metal works of the ancient city were discovered. But what was this area used for remains obscured.It usually takes two to three decades to finish unearthing a site. But one's life doesn't too have many decades. For archaeologist like Dang, the the process of unearthing a city like this is like raising a baby. Although, he and his colleagues have put much effort into this project, they are still many questions to figure out."We hope to know the city from its birth to death. We hope to understand it comprehensively through our long-time study. As we always say, although we each don't have many decades, we hope to age together in one city," said Dang. "It's worthwhile spending my entire career figuring out one city thoroughly."Filmed by Wang YuchengOn day 25 of our Amazing Xinjiang trip, we arrived in Luntai County in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in the middle of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

CGTN talked with veteran toy designer Stryker Wang who shared his inspirations and his opinion on China's toy market.During the interview, Wang showcased a little dinosaur DIO â the first member of the BeastBox series. It's a toy that can easily turn from a square into a dinosaur. The designer introduced the inspiration of the toy: "No matter what the shape of the toy is, it will always be wrapped up in a square box. So we thought why can't we make the toy a box, and the box is the toy itself. This is how DIO the dinosaur was born.""After its release, the toy received great feedback. Many say they are glad to see that China finally has its own transformative toy. And so we continued our BeastBox series," he added.The series has attracted many followers from both home and abroad. Wang used to work in the video game industry. But he always had a passion for toys. In 2000, he started a magazine about toys. Even though the publication didn't last long, Wang found a direction for his career. He said: "I've always been a kid that likes to play. I'm very curious and always wanted to dig into areas that are not familiar to the public."During the interview, he showed reporter his first toy collection â a little Transformer."My parent gave it to me when I was in middle school as an award for good grades. Even though it is very small, it brings back precious memories. It is fair to say that it is the beginning of my toy career," Wang said. The pop-culture trend of art toys has been developing and maturing in recent years. They first appeared in the 1990s, and their popularity has grown. Today, that demand is strong and the market is booming. Wang said that toys have always been a representation of culture through human development. For young people, toys are also art."Art is not only vases or oil paintings, toys are also a contemporary expression of art. I think the toy culture is very diverse. I hope more people can pay attention to them and realize that they are part of people's lives that are worth collecting and studying," he said. Wang believes that there are plenty of talented toy designers in China, but what's lacking are original styles and a healthy market. "I believe China's toy industry surpasses those of Japan and the U.S. at the base level. By that I mean industrial technology and human input. But on an ideological level we are still far behind. There's a lot to learn, like the ways of thinking and the experience from decades of practice," he said."However I think the gap is narrowing. With the rapid development of China's economy and its toy business, we are now having a lot of cooperation with designers globally," the designer added. "Be an interesting person, do fun things" â Wang says this is a motto for him and his company. He believes as long as people in the industry have true passion and love for this business, China's toy market is sure to grow stronger.Art toys, also known as designer toys, are meant for adults with a collection value produced with creative ideas.

In its holds we discovered military vehicles, porcelain and many crates with contents still unknown."The Karlsruhe had been taking part in Operation Hannibal, one of the largest sea evacuations in history, which helped more than one million German troops and civilians from East Prussia escape the Soviet advance towards the end of World War II.  Documentation from the time suggests the boat left Koenigsberg in a hurry, with a large cargo and 1,083 people onboard."All this, put together, stimulates the human imagination.

They were already down about 80 percent this year, due to the impact of the pandemic on the entertainment industry.  The company reopened its UK cinemas in July but customers numbers have been small since then.Cineworld's CEO, Moody Greidinger, said it was "not a decision we made lightly.""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings," he added. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time."Greidinger's statement also highlighted the challenges the firm faced in getting studios to release new movies.  Cineworld was hoping the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, could help turn around its fortunes. But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added. The world's second largest cinema chain, Cineworld, is temporarily shutting its theaters in the U.S. and the UK.The move is due to low footfall as a result of COVID-19 and puts 45,000 jobs at risk, including 5,500 in the UK.Cineworld's shares in London plunged more than 50 percent at one stage on Monday.

He will be greatly missed and always remembered," the Kenzo fashion house he founded wrote on Twitter.He "helped to write a new page in fashion, at the confluence of the East and the West," said Ralph Toledano of the Haute Couture Federation.His death comes 50 years after he launched his first collection in Paris, which he adopted as his home. "Every wall, every sky and every passerby helps me build my collections," he once said of the city.He retired from fashion in 1999, six years after selling his brand to luxury conglomerate LVMH, and dedicated his time to one-off projects including a design collection at the start of this year.Dreamt of ParisBorn in 1939 into a family of hoteliers, he chose to study art not catering, becoming a star pupil at Toyko's Bunka Gakuen college, where he carried off the top prize. He went on to work for Sanai, a major chain of fashion shops, but dreamt of Paris.The 1964 Olympic Games finally gave him opportunity to come to Europe. The block of flats in which he was renting an apartment was to be demolished to make way for a stadium.Like all the tenants, he was paid compensation and decided to blow the money on a one-way ticket on a cargo boat to Marseille.Arriving in Paris in the winter of 1965, hardly speaking any French, the only job he could get was in a poodle parlour.In 1970, however, he took the lease of premises in the Galerie Vivienne, then a rather down-at-heel shopping arcade. "With a few friends for three months we painted the walls with jungle scenes like Le Douanier Rousseau's Snake Charmer and baptised it Jungle Jap," he recalled later.His first show using amateur models to save money was held there. One of only 20 people invited included the editor-in-chief of Elle magazine, who liked the collection so much she ran it on the front cover.He became a name almost overnight, and went on to revitalize the knitwear industry with his contemporary interpretations.By the early 1980s, when other Japanese designers were making their way in Paris, Takada was already well established on the French fashion scene.His first men's collection was presented in 1983 and his first perfume, Kenzo Kenzo, in 1988.From the early 1980s boutiques opened all over the world in New York, London, Milan, Toyko and Rome, followed later by Hong Kong, Munich, Venice, Bangkok and Singapore.Paris mourns a sonKenzo's romantic style, with its eclectic mix of color, touches of exoticism, ethnic prints and folksy embroidery, suited the mood of the 1970s but adapted well to the sharper-looking 1980s and 1990s.He drew inspiration from his travels as well as Japanese work clothes, such as his favorite military tunics and coats. Peruvian striped blanket throws, colorful shawls, oriental blouses, peasant smocks, printed velvet, were all part of his signature.It was a measure of his success that he was notoriously prey to copyists. British designer Jasper Conran, interviewed on the problem, said he knew of a company in South Africa specializing in ripping off Kenzo, seam for seam. "They make a fortune - more than Kenzo I reckon - but there's nothing he can do about it."He guarded his privacy by building himself a house in the country in the very heart of Paris, only a few yards from the Bastille opera house, complete with authentic tea pavilion and a pool of carp."A designer with immense talent, he gave color and light their rightful place in fashion," said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo on Twitter.

In his narratives, Cao used flowery language to describe her and their sincere love.Many say that Ye perfectly combines both Western culture and eastern culture in her adaption of ancient paintings. But Ye herself doesn't really agree."I think my paintings are deeply rooted in my hometown and our Chinese culture. I'm a native Chinese. My paintings just look slightly Western in format," Ye told CGTN.Ye studied at the Chinese Academy of Art and the Oslo National Academy of the Arts in Norway. She has also traveled to over 20 countries. She said those experiences might contribute to her  mixed painting style."Many people like me had the experience of studying abroad. We've not only seen Gu Kaizhi but also Michelangelo. This so-called Eastern-Western mixed style is something that comes out naturally from my mind,â she said.Over the past decade, Ye has completed several painting books based on ancient Chinese stories and calligraphy works, including the "Preface of the Orchid Pavilion" ("Lanting Xu') and "Mulan."Reflecting on her years of practice, Ye joked that painting itself is labor-intensive work, like climbing a mountain."I feel the happiest when I'm drawing drafts because I can draw whatever I want. Another moment I feel the happiest is when I finally finish a certain piece. That will give me a sense of fulfillment,â Ye told CGTN.During the interview, Ye also revealed her plan to make a piece related to cats as she is a cat-person. She also said she longs for some breakthrough in future works."I'm more unrestrained and vigorous than what I've presented in my drawings. I hope I can make more imaginative work in the future. I think I'll get the chance to do it.

Teng Kuixing, jury member and also a famous voice director, shared his thoughts with CGTN.With more than two decades of dubbing experience, Teng has given voice to many popular cartoons including "Dragon Balls" and "Crayon Shin Chain." In 2015, Teng was the voice director for the Chinese animation film "Monkey King: Hero Is Back," which was described as the future of domestic animation.Speaking of the work, Teng vividly recalls the process of creation."The creative process was very, very difficult at the beginning. Every line was recorded dozens of times. As you can imagine, we got very tired and numb. We take a break and then go on to the next one, and then come back and listen," he said. "Language is like a musical instrument. It must be in the correct position, no more or less, to arouse the audience's emotions. So, we go back and forth," he added.There were five competition areas in total, with a network competition area on the new media platform. Dubbing fans only needed to upload their works on the network platform to participate in the competition.Following the start of registration on June 16, more than 3,000 entries were received from six regions. The quality of the entries has been greatly improved compared with previous years, among which non-professional competitors account for a large proportion.Having won the Best Mentor Award, Teng thinks the competition has been getting more and more professional. "In both team and individual competitions, the ability displayed is higher than that of previous ones. Of course, we do it every year, and it's going to get better and better, and that's also what we're looking forward to," he said.The participation of more and more professional competitors reflects the growing strength of the industry. As an expert, Teng said there is still a long way to go for the competitors. "More and more people are taking this as a career in this industry currently. Therefore, the elimination rate is higher and requirements keep on getting higher. Only by being better can you stay and have a chance to stand out," he said.Reporter: Yang MengVideographer: Shen LanglangVideo editor: Zhang ChunnanCover image designer: Chen YuyangProject manager: Deng JunfangProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiWinners of the Character Voice Competition were unveiled at the 16th China International Cartoon and Animation Festival (CICAF).

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

The United States sent troops and dispatched ships and aircraft to meddle in the Sino-Korean border. Facing American threats, the newly founded People's Republic of China decided in October to participate in the war to defend its national security and help its neighbor, calling it the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.Hundreds of thousands of young people in China joined the war to defend their homeland, including then 17-year-old Zhou.According to Zhou's memories, Korea suffered unprecedented cold weather that year. PVA soldiers braved temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, eating potatoes and drinking snow water to quench their thirst while carrying out combat missions in the Hwangchoryong area in Korea."We lay on the snow for three days. On the last night, when we finally started to fight the enemy, I couldn't get up anymore. My feet and hands were numb," said Zhou.After the battle, other PVA soldiers found Zhou unconscious in the snow and already suffering from frostbite. If he did not undergo surgery immediately, his life would be in danger. Due to the lack of anesthetics, the doctor wrapped his limbs with ice cubes and performed the amputation while he was in a coma with a high fever.After the surgery, the doctor said, "If he doesn't wake up within seven days, he will die."Zhou's strength helped him survive. Although he lost both his hands and legs, he didn't give up. After returning to China, he took care of his basic needs and also found the will power to practice calligraphy despite inherent difficulties.Over the past decades, Zhou completed nearly 2,000 calligraphy pieces and won many awards in various calligraphy competitions.Zhou's patriotism and perseverance have moved and inspired many Chinese netizens.A video of a veteran amputee doing calligraphy is tugging at the heartstrings of many Chinese netizens.

Many famous directors, including James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, and Ang Lee, along with the Directors Guild of America, the National Association of Theater Owners, the Motion Picture Association of America sent a letter to the U.S. Congress asking for help for the COVID-19 affected cinema industry, Reuters said. In the letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, and Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy, the directors asked that the relevant department prioritize helping industries hardest hit, like the country's beloved cinemas.The letter suggests redirecting unallocated funds from the CARES Act (The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) towards proposals that help businesses that have suffered the biggest drops in revenue due to the pandemic.The pandemic has dealt a devastating financial blow to cinemas, the letter indicated.

Many famous directors, including James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, and Ang Lee, along with the Directors Guild of America, the National Association of Theater Owners, the Motion Picture Association of America sent a letter to the U.S. Congress asking for help for the COVID-19 affected cinema industry, Reuters said. In the letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, and Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy, the directors asked that the relevant department prioritize helping industries hardest hit, like the country's beloved cinemas.The letter suggests redirecting unallocated funds from the CARES Act (The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) towards proposals that help businesses that have suffered the biggest drops in revenue due to the pandemic.The pandemic has dealt a devastating financial blow to cinemas, the letter indicated. Ninety-three percent of film companies recorded more than 75 percent losses in the second quarter of 2020.

They are small meandering alleyways that form a maze of siheyuan, which are single-story homes surrounded by open-air courtyards. Life in the hutong neighborhoods follows a slow pace, giving an atmosphere of days gone by. In many ways, the hutong is more than just an architectural concept. It is a way of life and a living imprint of time. Over the years, many dwellings have been falling apart and truly authentic hutongs are no longer ideal living spaces by today's standards.This is why preserving and restoring hutongs have become an important point of discussion in the urban development of Beijing. Recently, the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center joined hands with Beijing Tian Heng Development Group to revitalize Beijing Shi Cha Hai's hutong neighbourhoods. Hu Xinyu, trustee of Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center (CHP), believes the collaboration between the two is "a perfect match."Hu explains that as a state-owned company, Tian Heng has the capability to acquire courtyards that need repair. And CHP, as a charity group, has the capacity to mobilize volunteers, and contribute to the design and heritage preservation measure in regenerating courtyards. Over the past eight years, Tian Heng has looked to restore 100 courtyards, 30 of which are still under construction.To conserve and protect the courtyard homes, Chen Liming, head of engineering department at Tian Heng adheres to a strict set of principles. "Fix and repair" is the mantra he follows when refurbishing courtyard homes. "Keep what's worth keeping" is also important.For one project, Chen had a new wall built from old bricks retained from the original structure before it was taken down."If we can't keep the entire structure, then we preserve at least parts of it," Chen states.Finally, "recycle what's reusable." Chen believes things like old tiles, wooden frames, and cornerstones are "time prints." Adding them back into the new house and the refurbished home will give it its own distinctive personality. For this year's Beijing Design Week, Tian Heng presented several remodeled projects to the public. Some are rooms transformed into Airbnbs, while others are courtyard homes turned into boutique hotels. These reinvented spaces encourage interaction between local residents and visitors, giving these old neighborhoods a new purpose while maintaining their historical faÃ§ade. Renovating the courtyards by redesigning them in a new light is another way architects are reviving the hutongs. Yinyuan, or the "Invisible Yard" at Bao Chao Hutong had been vacant and deserted over the past five years. But this summer, the 50 square meter courtyard home had a revolutionary makeover. Mirrored floors are used to bring the hutong skyscape into the private alley and see-through glass walls are installed to lighten up the living area. As for existing brickwork and the original wooden beams, they are left exposed across the interior to contrast the new intervention, creating a dialogue between the past and future.Over the past decade, a growing number of Chinese and international architects have been revitalizing these iconic architectures. They are exploring new possibilities for hutongs by reinventing their spaces and re-adapting their uses. But the impact these urban interventions and renovations will have on the hutongs and their rustic charm, only time will tell. The old city of Beijing is lined with hutongs.

Through a tidy array of lights, the enormous natural power is seen pushing the waves forward and pounding against riverbanks harshly, as if countless of silver dragons were vigorously swimming.Under the background of light beams near the river, viewers can savor a skillful water painting created by nature.It looks like a landscape painting on water, but on a closer look, it also looks like a flowing music score that plays grandiose symphonies.According to local authorities, the scenic area has received more than 5,000 visitors within five days by October 1. The number of daily views is estimated to reach a peak on October 4, the 18th day of the eighth month on Chinese lunar calendar, when the tidal bores reach their most spectacular moment.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Jingjie)Now is the best time to admire the Tidal Bore of the Qiantang River, an annual natural spectacle, in east China's coastal city.The picturesque scene featuring magnificent tidal bores rushing under the luminous moon attracted crowds of locals and visitors in Haining City, Zhejiang Province on Thursday night.Since ancient times, the world-famous Qiantang Tidal Bore, which is created by the gravity from the moon and the rotation of the Earth, has been hailed as a "marvelous spectacle on earth."One of the world's largest tidal bores ushered in the best time of the year for sightseeing with the advent of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, coinciding with China's National Day.It has been a great tradition and local custom in the eastern province for over 2,000 years to enjoy the natural wonder and celebrate under the full moon around the festival, when the tidal waves become the biggest bores.The best vantage point for watching the amazing back-flow bore in Haining City made a big innovation this year to improve tourists' experience.Tourists flocking to the riversides can enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to not only hear but watch the amazing scene at night owing to the elaborately designed light beam arrays.The Qiantang Tidal Bore is also called "the Silver Dragon" by locals.

It is the first long holiday over three days since the coronavirus epidemic broke out in January.The tourism industry suffered a heavy blow during the epidemic. With the epidemic largely under control in the country, people are pinning high hopes on the holiday for a tourism boost. Preferential price stimulates tourism boomOne month before the holiday, travel agencies introduced various discounts and subsidies to attract tourists.China's top online travel platform Ctrip rolled out 1 billion yuan of subsidies for the National Day holiday on September 7, while its contender Fliggy backed by Alibaba announced a 10-billion-yuan-subsidy plan one day after. These can be used to book train tickets, hotels and scenic spot tickets.For example, if the subsidies are properly used, the ticket price for Shanghai Disney Resort can reach as low as 199 yuan compared to its normal price of 500 to 700 yuan, and the ticket price for some popular destinations, such as Beijing's Palace Museum and Guangzhou Chimelong Tourist Resort, can be halved.Scenic spots themselves have also striven to attract more visitors, with more than 500 across China exempting or reducing ticket prices. Central China's Hubei Province, which was hardly-hit by the epidemic earlier this year, opened all of its national A-level scenic spots for free to tourists from August to December 31.To further promote consumption, regional governments in collaboration with eCommerce platforms and local business owners, give out consumption vouchers.East China's Shandong Province will issue consumption vouchers valued at 20 million yuan during the holiday, which can be used on more than 340,000 cultural and tourist products. Beijing is scheduled to hand out 12.5 million vouchers in seven batches in October, among which are meal vouchers used in onsite restaurants and take-away food.Epidemic prevention measures taken to keep safetyTo meet the tourists' demand during the holiday, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism recently raised the capped number of tourists from 50 percent to 75 percent in scenic spots.The Palace Museum raised the limited number of visitors from 12,000 to 30,000 since Thursday, the most since it reopened. But visitors should book the ticket online in advance, which is a common practice in most scenic spots across the country.Tourists are also arranged to visit in staggered time. Xinhua reported that 90 percent of 280 national 5A-level scenic spots have set up the booking system for tourists to visit in batches.For open-air scenic spots, such as Chaka Salt Lake in northwest China's Qinghai Province, increased number of staff members and volunteers have been deployed to prevent large crowds gathering.China saw 108 million visits and raked in 76.5 billion yuan in tourism income on October 2, the second day of the National Day holiday, while the first day observed a total of 97 million visits with 76.7 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in tourism income, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, raising people's expectation for a tourism boom.This year, the National Day coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, marking an extended holiday of eight days.

It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera.

Mei took the traditional Chinese art abroad in the early 20th century, impressing foreign audiences with his beautiful voice and unforgettable performances. "Peking Opera needs to be passed down from one generation to the next, and our cultural exchanges with other countries also needed to be passed down like this," Yu told CGTN. Traditional festivals give people a chance to know more about time-honored culture like the Peking Opera, and also allows people to enjoy the country's national treasures. (Cover image designed bu Xu Qianyun)The Mid-Autumn Festival falls on October 1 this year, marking one of the most important and poetic Chinese festivals.

It rolled out seven digitalized products at once in July 2019. They include the applications featuring high-resolution images of the museums' famous paintings, 360-degree view of various architecture, interactive games, music videos and comics.The role of digitized products has been highlighted during the coronavirus pandemic this year, as they enable global audiences to experience and appreciate the beauty of Chinese culture at home.The Forbidden City was built in 1925 and served as the imperial palace of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties before turning into a museum. This year marks the palace's 600th birthday, and the museum will host a list of activities, such as exhibitions and academic seminars, to introduce some publications and film and TV productions.Read more:Forbidden City inaugurates exhibition to celebrate its 600th birthdayExperience cultural heritage at home amid virus, digitalization matters(With input from Xinhua)China's Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, can now be experienced by people living over 1,000 kilometers away, thanks to virtual reality (VR) technology.The museum, located in Beijing, shared this latest development in the digitization of cultural relics during the 2020 World Conference on VR Industry, which opened on Monday in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province.Wearing VR glasses, visitors to the conference were able to view vivid 3D images of cultural relics and the construction process of ancient buildings in the Forbidden City.The organizers displayed nine life-size 3D-printed models of the Jingdezhen porcelains collected by and displayed at the Palace Museum, a reference to Jingdezhen, also known as China's porcelain capital.Visitors were also able to make VR trips to archaeological excavation sites where ancient porcelains were unearthed.Zhang Peipei, an engineer with the museum, said that VR technology has been widely used in the digital protection of cultural relics, with visitors able to view the indoor structures of ancient buildings that are closed to the public to protect relics."As the Palace Museum has been committed to the research of advanced technologies and the display of its cultural heritage, it is our mission to build a museum that caters to the needs of the era," said Wang Yuegong, deputy curator of the museum.The new technological trends promote the construction of museum innovation systems, establishing a deep integration of production, teaching and research and enhancing the protection, utilization and inheritance of cultural relics, Wang said.The museum started exploration digitization more than 20 years ago.

With an average age of 90, the artists have made significant contributions to the development of this art-form in China.In total, there are 40 oil paintings on show at Beijing's Longfu Art Center. They were created by major figures in Chinese oil painting â Zhan Jianjun, Jin Shangyi, Quan Shanshi, Zhong Han and Wen Lipeng. They each devoted some 70 years to the art form, and established their own style and artistic language. It's the first time for them to have an exhibition together. "Our generation of painters, we have a sense of responsibility. After studying oil painting, we want to develop this art form in China. It's not like traditional Chinese painting, which has deep foundations in China. Oil panting was imported from the west. So we feel responsible to study it and promote it," said Wen Lipeng. Often addressed as the third generation of Chinese oil painters, the artists have played an important role in promoting oil painting in China. They are also the founders of the China Oil Painting Society. "In the past decades, the China Oil Painting Society has organized many exhibitions. And this time, I'm glad to see an exhibit that features us old people. It's a reminiscence as well as a new beginning for the China Oil Painting Society," said Jin Shangyi.Even in old age, the artists still have a strong desire to create. Many of the works in the exhibition are recent, giving audiences a chance to admire their artistic vitality. What the artists have in common is their insistence on developing oil paintings with a Chinese style. They studied the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western art in great depth. By mastering Western painting skills and combining them with traditional Chinese culture, the artists have managed to create works with unique Chinese characteristics. "The key question is in which direction Chinese oil painting should develop. I think we are clear that we need to follow the Chinese road. It is oil painting, but it's Chinese oil painting," said Wen Lipeng.The exhibition runs until November 30 and is free to the public.An exhibition showcasing the works of five prominent figures who have shaped the Chinese oil painting scene is on display in Beijing.

Its executive chef is 27-year-old trailblazer Lucas Sin.We find Sin in the kitchen of his Greenwich Village restaurant, ready to whip up a dish for a new onsite pop-kitchen called "Nice Day Chinese Takeout" that pays homage to American Chinese foodâ¦ a cuisine that has long fascinated Sin, an immigrant from Hong Kong."This is our take on chow mein, which is very popular in American Chinese restaurants," explained Sin from behind his mask as he speaks over a sizzling wok. "But the way we do it, the sauce that we put in, is more similar to the original Cantonese version than the American version."Sin's take on this quintessential American Chinese recipe hints at how the chef has kept the business going strong in a pandemic that has crippled the economy."I wanted to keep cooking creatively, and I wanted to keep thinking about the things I was interested in despite the pandemic."Sin was eager to defy stereotypes about Chinese food and give it the respect he felt the cuisine deserves, but he also wanted to explore the reach and evolution of Chinese food across cultures."I wanted to give my team a chance to research and think about how Chinese food might actually be good for you," he said.  "There's this sentiment that Chinese food must be bad for you if people are getting sick in China, there's that end of the narrative, and there's also my research in how big Chinese cuisine is across the Chinese diaspora all over the world."With restaurants only permitted take-out and deliveries, Junzi Kitchen launched several new initiatives including its "Share A Meal" program to help feed frontline workers.For his customers, he kicked off a series called "Distance Dining" in which he partnered with a diverse range of chefs to design fully cooked three-course meals that customers can order in advance, to show how Chinese food intersects with the cuisine of other cultures, from Creole to West African."Chinese food seems to have almost an uncanny ability to be everywhere around the world (and) touch so many different communities. I wanted to explore those intersections."Once the food is delivered, diners can tune in to an Instagram Live session with Sin and other chefs for a demonstration on how to properly heat the food for an authentic experience.Straight from the chefs' home kitchens, the sound of cooking is accompanied by a dash of banter and a sprinkle of humor. For those hungry for human connection in these strange times, it puts the "social" in social distancing.But the pandemic has been anything but social. For America's Chinese community, the coronavirus emerged as relations between China and the U.S. deteriorated and spilled over into Chinese communities.In New York, Chinese restaurants were hit by a one-two punch from the pandemic's economic fallout as well as a spike in racism against Asians, fueled by the White House which blamed China for the coronavirus.There were increasing reports of Asians being attacked or verbally assaulted, and Chinese restaurants vandalized and defaced. Sin had beer cans and a fluorescent light bulb thrown at him."Obviously, I'm surprised," Sin said."I think the wonderful thing about coming here to the U.S. as an immigrant is that I have the privilege of not needing to think of myself as a minority, but when friends in the industry especially have been facing expressive anti-Chinese sentiment, I think that's when it really hits home the most," he added.The upside, according to Sin, is that some in the businesses have chosen to build resilience. That might explain Junzi Kitchen's own story of survival."Our primary mission at Junzi is to show people that Chinese food is more wonderful and diverse than they might think otherwise," he told us."Just because there's a pandemic out there doesn't mean that the mission goes away."Unable to weather the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many restaurants in New York City have gone out of business, but one has defied the odds by focusing on the diversity of Chinese food and the power of social media.The restaurant is Junzi Kitchen, a modern fast-casual Chinese eatery in Manhattan that serves up fare described as authentic, honest and straightforward.

"But the way we do it, the sauce that we put in, is more similar to the original Cantonese version than the American version."Sin's take on this quintessential American Chinese recipe hints at how the chef has kept the business going strong in a pandemic that has crippled the economy."I wanted to keep cooking creatively, and I wanted to keep thinking about the things I was interested in despite the pandemic."Sin was eager to defy stereotypes about Chinese food and give it the respect he felt the cuisine deserves, but he also wanted to explore the reach and evolution of Chinese food across cultures."I wanted to give my team a chance to research and think about how Chinese food might actually be good for you," he said.  "There's this sentiment that Chinese food must be bad for you if people are getting sick in China, there's that end of the narrative, and there's also my research in how big Chinese cuisine is across the Chinese diaspora all over the world."With restaurants only permitted take-out and deliveries, Junzi Kitchen launched several new initiatives including its "Share A Meal" program to help feed frontline workers.For his customers, he kicked off a series called "Distance Dining" in which he partnered with a diverse range of chefs to design fully cooked three-course meals that customers can order in advance, to show how Chinese food intersects with the cuisine of other cultures, from Creole to West African."Chinese food seems to have almost an uncanny ability to be everywhere around the world (and) touch so many different communities. I wanted to explore those intersections."Once the food is delivered, diners can tune in to an Instagram Live session with Sin and other chefs for a demonstration on how to properly heat the food for an authentic experience.Straight from the chefs' home kitchens, the sound of cooking is accompanied by a dash of banter and a sprinkle of humor. For those hungry for human connection in these strange times, it puts the "social" in social distancing.But the pandemic has been anything but social. For America's Chinese community, the coronavirus emerged as relations between China and the U.S. deteriorated and spilled over into Chinese communities.In New York, Chinese restaurants were hit by a one-two punch from the pandemic's economic fallout as well as a spike in racism against Asians, fueled by the White House which blamed China for the coronavirus.There were increasing reports of Asians being attacked or verbally assaulted, and Chinese restaurants vandalized and defaced. Sin had beer cans and a fluorescent light bulb thrown at him."Obviously, I'm surprised," Sin said."I think the wonderful thing about coming here to the U.S. as an immigrant is that I have the privilege of not needing to think of myself as a minority, but when friends in the industry especially have been facing expressive anti-Chinese sentiment, I think that's when it really hits home the most," he added.The upside, according to Sin, is that some in the businesses have chosen to build resilience. That might explain Junzi Kitchen's own story of survival."Our primary mission at Junzi is to show people that Chinese food is more wonderful and diverse than they might think otherwise," he told us."Just because there's a pandemic out there doesn't mean that the mission goes away."The city of Wuhan, hit hard several months ago by the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, is holding a week-long beer festival. The event aims to stimulate the city's nighttime economy in places where drinks, food, and entertainment are offered. Everyone has free access to dozens of festival venues that the local government has set for its more than ten million people. Visitors attending it will find temperature and security checks along with health regulations when they arrive. The goal is to enjoy the event and contribute to the city revival. When it kicked off last weekend, the main venue in Dongxihu District didn't expect the tens of thousands of visitors who turned out, according to the organizer. "We didn't have enough on the first day, as many places serving beer and food were sold out within just half an hour," said Li Jiange, deputy chief of the Business Bureau of Dongxihu. "So, we doubled it the next day, but all of it went quickly again." Given the situation, many wondered if a mass gathering could be done safely. Officials say they conduct daily disinfection before the event. Health workers are monitoring the crowd. Besides, no local cases have been reported for months since Wuhan offered free mass testing in May. "You know, when you now walk in the city, everybody appears to have put those fears aside," said one visitor who celebrated his 50th birthday over some beers with the family. "Since this beer festival is happening, I feel like it's a great opportunity to tell people in other cities in China that Wuhan is fine. We're definitely fine and doing well," a beer vendor said. The event also provides opportunities for many local businesses, especially those featuring agricultural products in the district. Internet celebrities were invited to livestream for them, an increasingly popular marketing strategy now in China. Some stalls are making more than a thousand dollars a day. Young local bands are also putting their first-ever performance this year. Many expect the success of this event will have a positive impact and more large gatherings can be organized in the future.  Read more: Back to normal: Wuhan water party makes overseas netizens enviousThe city of Wuhan, hit hard several months ago by the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, is holding a week-long beer festival.

Both McDonald's and Burger King assured Chinese customers by saying on their official Weibo accounts that the food packaging used in China fully complies with national standards.China prohibits the use of PFAS as additives in the food packaging material so that any qualified packaging does not contain them.Business Insider reported that scientists have uncovered links between PFAS and cancer, liver damage, thyroid disease, and developmental issues. About 99 percent of Americans have the chemicals in their bloodstreams, which could stay in the body for life.The China franchise of McDonald's and Burger King stated on Monday that there are no toxic PFAS substances in food wrappers in China after their overseas counterparts were questioned on the issue.A report released by environmental advocacy groups based in the U.S. revealed on Thursday that the two food chains use toxic PFAS substances, namely human-made perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals, in the packaging of some of their food.According to the report, testing included 38 food packaging samples from six fast-food chains shows that nearly half of all samples tested positive for fluorine above the screening level, meaning they likely contain PFAS substances.The topic became trending on China's social media.

Among them is opera prodigy, Chinese countertenor Liu Shen. CGTN's Shen Li caught up with him during the festival's "Music at Noon" concert to find out how he came into this career and his future plans.At this mini recital at the Beijing Music Festival, Liu wowed the audience with his performances of Henry Purcell's "Music for a While," arias from some of Handel's operas, and Claude Debussy's Art Songs. He said this varied program helped express "my many sides."Liu is a countertenor, which means he has a vocal range that extends upwards from his natural tenor into mezzo-soprano.At the age of 5, his parents took him to see "La Traviata" and he has been obsessed with opera ever since.He went on to study at the Juilliard School and has collaborated with maestros like conductor Yu Long and the world's leading orchestras.Now at 20, the opera prodigy said he's still finding his voice.Liu said, "The countertenors, they don't just sing operas, there's a lot of non-gender specific pieces that we could do, so it's the best way to express myself."When asked about whether he could like to try music from other genres, Liu revealed his interest in jazz, Broadway music and even Peking Opera. "It's important to understand other genres of music," he added.Liu is able to sing in many different languages, including Italian, French, German and even Hebrew. "My passion for opera really sparks my passion for languages, the twos are somehow connected," he said.Apart from being active on stage as a countertenor, Liu is equally passionate about acting. "Through opera, I found out so many things about acting and music combined together â the beat, the rhythm," he said. "I would love to be an opera director because you get both the perspectives," he added. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the China Philharmonic Orchestra, five young musicians born in 2000 are taking center stage at the closing concert of Beijing Music Festival on Tuesday.

They have special visas that allow them to stay for 90 days with the option to renew twice. The first 14 days have to be spent in quarantine.Among other stipulations, they also need to have proof of travel insurance and medical insurance for in and outpatient treatment, as well as for treatment for COVID-19.After landing, their papers were checked, and their temperatures were taken before they were allowed through immigration. In all, they had to pass through three thermoscans as they walked through the airport, according to airport authorities. As they queued to board buses, workers in protective clothing disinfected their luggage."We can assure everyone that all our measures are systematic and meet international standards," said the airport's deputy general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn.Chinese tourists were seen putting on raincoats as the last step before leaving for their quarantine accommodation. Kittipong said this was not a government requirement, but rather, he said, the raincoats appeared to have been part of a complimentary package of items from their hotel.Almost 40 million people visited Thailand in 2019, with tourism accounting for more than 10 percent of the country's GDP. But the halting of international flights in early April, due to the pandemic, has left the sector in dire straits. Well-known tourist spots, used to hordes of visitors, are now almost empty, as are the country's famous sandy beaches.More flights are scheduled for tourists on special visas in the coming weeks.(Cover: Chinese tourists from Shanghai arrive at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, October 20, 2020. /AP)Thailand welcomed its first foreign tourists in seven months on Tuesday, bringing a tiny ray of hope to a vital industry that has been brought to its knees by the coronavirus crisis.Thirty-nine Chinese tourists flew into Suvarnabhumi Airport on the outskirts of Bangkok on a Spring Airlines flight from Shanghai.

The director is a woman, Liana Ceterchi. "Each one of us is a facet of Ana Novac's soul and memory," Morgenstern said. The play's author, born Zimra Harsanyi, hails from Romania's northern Transylvania region. She was deported at age 14. The diary she kept inside a Nazi concentration camp was first published in Hungary in 1966 and later translated into several languages, but it only hit bookshelves in her home country in 2004. Many liken Novac's work to that of Anne Frank, author of the "The Diary of a Young Girl," which documented her life in hiding in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands before she was deported to concentration camps. "We are bearers of scars from wounds that are not directly ours, but still we carry these scars," Morgenstern said. She stressed the importance of evoking events through theatrical performance "in order to understand the ghosts of a painful past, the memories of terrible events that have split the world into executioners and victims."Actresses wear the striped outfits of concentration camps against a backdrop of images depicting camp entrances, gas chambers and empty sleeping quarters. Photographs and names of Holocaust victims scroll in a video over the stage and performers. The performers also hold human bones and a skull during monologues. The pandemic has had a severe impact on Romania's artistic community, triggering the closure of theaters during the lockdown. Later, theaters were allowed to hold performances only outdoors, then indoors with a limited number of spectators. "These are existential and also moral questions. What to do to protect life, not to be a threat but at the same time continue our existence and activity and maintain our status as artists?" Morgenstern said.(With input from AP)(Cover image: Actresses of the Jewish State Theater in Bucharest, wearing face masks for protection against COVID-19, perform during rehearsals for the premiere of "The Beautiful Days of My Youth," based on the diary of Romanian Jewish Holocaust survivor Ana Novac. /AP)The latest premiere at the Jewish State Theater in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, explores the horrors of the Holocaust via a survivor's memories of the Auschwitz and Plaszow concentration camps. Friday's debut of "The Beautiful Days of My Youth" by Romanian Jewish Holocaust survivor Ana Novac follows the National Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorations on October 9, the day when deportations of Romania's Jews and Roma began in 1941. Some 280,000 Jews and 11,000 Roma were deported and killed under Romania's pro-Nazi regime during World War II.The play premiered online and in front of spectators who took up less than a third of the seats because of measures meant to slow the coronavirus pandemic in the eastern European nation. Maia Morgenstern, head of the Jewish State Theater and a Romanian Jewish actress best known for playing Mary in Mel Gibson's controversial 2004 movie "The Passion of the Christ," described the play's staging as an "all-female project."

among those presenting honors to pandemic-era student filmmakers.The Student Academy Awards are a key program of the Hollywood film industry's top body, which has already delayed next year's Oscars as speculation builds that the glitzy main ceremony may also take place remotely."I'm hopeful, as we all are, that this will also be the last virtual Student Academy Awards," said Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president David Rubin, signaling desire that the industry can soon return to normal."Just as inflection points like the Cold War and 9/11 shaped the perspective of past generations of filmmakers from Stanley Kramer to Kathryn Bigelow, 2020 â a year like no other â will no doubt forever influence what your generation sees through the camera lens."Students honored at the online ceremony described how lockdowns around the world had affected their finishing touches to movies shot as part of their academic programs."I did change the sound of what my film would have been," said Pilar Garcia-Fernandezsesma, who won the top animation prize for her film "Ciervo" after moving back in with her parents."I ended up putting flute in my film, when I probably wouldn't have done, because I had access to my middle school flute lying around in my bedroom."Allison Waite, honored for her documentary about a Black teen shot dead in a Los Angeles convenience store, said despite the challenges of the pandemic, "being silent at this moment was not productive.""With things happening in the US, with George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, there's so much discussion to be had," she said.Past student winners include Lee, "Back To The Future" filmmaker Robert Zemeckis and upcoming 007 director Cary Fukunaga.A record 13 of the 18 winners were women in this year's version of the

Claude Monet masterpiece was sold in London on Wednesday for about 7.5 million pounds (about $9.8 million), the second highest price at auction for the mysterious artist.The oil on canvas work, "Show Me the Monet," a modern take on Monet's impressionist classic "The Water-Lily Pond," was sold at Sotheby's following a bidding battle."The hammer came down after five determined collectors battled for nearly nine minutes to drive the final price beyond its estimate of 3,000,000-5,000,000 pounds to become the second highest price for the artist at auction," Sotheby's said.The sale comes a year after a Banksy painting depicting the British parliament populated by chimpanzees smashed the record for the street artist by fetching nearly 9.9 million pounds.On that occasion, the 2009 work titled "Devolved Parliament" attracted a 13-minute battle between 10 different bidders."Show Me the Monet" was created in 2005, as part of a collection called "The Crude Oils" and had first been shown publicly in only Banksy's second gallery exhibition.The painting transforms Monet's masterpiece depicting a Japanese-style bridge in his famous garden at Giverny into a modern-day fly-tipping spot.Instead of an idyllic lily pond, the composition shows discarded shopping trollies and a fluorescent orange traffic cone floating in the water beneath the bridge."Ever prescient as a voice of protest and social dissent, here Banksy shines a light on society's disregard for the environment in favor of the wasteful excesses of consumerism," said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's European Head of Contemporary Art."Recent years have seen seminal Banksys come to auction, but this is one of his strongest, and most iconic, to appear yet," he added.Banksy has become a household name since the turn of the century, after his iconic graffiti paintings began to appear overnight on buildings and at sites around the world.The artist's identity remains shrouded in mystery even as his works have begun to attract increasingly high sums at auction.Meanwhile, he continues to use his art in stunts that generate huge publicity.In 2018, his "Girl With The Balloon" partially shredded itself as the hammer came down at Sotheby's, becoming the re-titled "Love Is In The Bin."(Cover: A visitor looks at Banksy's 'Show me the Monet' on display at Sotheby's in central London, UK, September 18, 2020. /CFP)An

Instead of sashes, buttons are commonly used. Coming up is the most debated one: The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) ensemble. It looks quite similar to hanfu, the traditional costume for Han Chinese, but it also breaks a few rules. The collar should lap for both men and women. The sleeves should be long and wide to meet the two words: kuan and he. Sashes should be used instead of buttons. As for Western clothing, the men's jacket is a typical example. Tailoring requires a proper fit for the individual achieved with cutting and seams. The Vietnamese ao dai, or Vietnamese long dress, is often thought to be related to hanfu, but it is more like a qipao.  The tunic is fitted with a stand-up collar fastened with buttons. It's the national costume of Vietnam. Very similar to the ao dai, the blue dress is a traditional costume mostly seen in Southern China.  The outfit does include hanfu design elements, but essentially, it is also an outfit with Western influence. The dress uses Western dimensional cutting, and its collar disqualifies it from being hanfu. Now, can you spot the differences? Read more:Tradition goes modern: What the Chinese Hanfu clothing system is all aboutWhen talking about traditional Chinese clothing, the tangzhuang (Tang suit) and the qipao (cheongsam) are probably the two best-known styles, but hanfu experts and enthusiasts insist they are not authentic. Even though they have kept traditional Chinese motifs, Western tailoring is used in the garments instead of hanfu's  plain cutting on just one piece of fabric.  Referring back to the first episode where we have talked about the eight characteristics of hanfu, they are "ping zhong jiao you, kuan tuan he ying."  In comparison, the shoulders of the tangzhuang and qipao are designed to fit.

On the one hand, it has helped China's distance education, and on the other hand, it has provided a large number of online job opportunities for the Filipino people," said Ambassador Huang Xilian, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines, during his keynote speech at the 2020 Sino-Philippines Educational Exchanges Seminar held in Beijing on Friday.The event, hosted by 51Talk, one of China's leading online English education platform, aimed to further strengthen and develop bilateral education exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the year marking the 45th anniversary of the founding of bilateral relations between the Philippines and China."51Talk has fully tapped the talents from the Philippines in the past several years. With the help of online digital technology, 51Talk has opened a window for thousands of Chinese children to communicate with foreign teachers worldwide, and it has created a worthwhile online platform for China-Philippines educational cooperation," said Ambassador Huang.Philippine Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, H.E. Jose Santiago Sta. Romana is glad to see many Filipinos teaching Chinese students via internet."I'm very pleased that 51Talk is giving an opportunity to 20,000 competent Filipino educators to take part in nurturing the eagerness of nearly 300,000 young Chinese people to learn the English language. This educational exchange albeit virtual provides an enabling environment for cultural exchange between Filipinos and the Chinese," said Ambassador Sta. Romana, adding that he hopes "more doors will be opened up for more and more Filipino educators in the same mutually beneficial manner."ESL market has seen a rapid growth in China in recent years with the deepening and widening reform and opening up policies. This has witnessed many companies concentrate on providing quality English education to Chinese students by hiring foreign teachers to teach on their online platforms.51Talk has set up several bases in Philippines to help the organization hire and train Filipino educators. Tens of thousands of Chinese students are estimated to improve their English speaking abilities with thousands of Filipino teachers on the platform.This year, the global pandemic struck countries worldwide including China and Philippines. As the pandemic caused economic fallout and the loss of millions of jobs, 51Talk launched several campaigns to spread awareness of the livelihood opportunities available in the platform to attract 30,000 online English teachers.Besides, the organization donated 5.25 million pesos (0.11 million U.S. dollars) worth of medical equipment and supplies to several hospitals in the Philippines to aid in their efforts to combat COVID-19.Jack Huang, CEO and Co-Founder of 51Talk, said he is happy to see the online education helps strengthen the ties of our two countries.In June, 51 Talk launched an online video album of people waving in both the Philippines and China, where more than 5,000 people engaged. The attempt was judged by the Guinness World Records for the largest number of people waving on an online video album.The attempt is said to express the friendship between the two countries in celebration of the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations as well as to show to the world the unity and relationship between the peoples of both countries.The booming online education and increasingly popular Filipino teachers in China's ESL (English as a Second Language) market is helping to bolster a win-win development for China and Philippines."China's emerging industries such as online education under the epidemic have catalyzed a new win-win cooperation model for China and the Philippines.

As the camera was introduced to China in the mid-19th century, also the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), studies and researches are carried out in a more in-depth way.At a preview of an upcoming photograph auction held by Yingyi Auction House, part of the Chinese history and people's lives in the past 180 years is revealed. The barber, the courtroom, and women with bound feet were some of China's iconic images through the lens of Western photographers in the 19th century.David Knox Griffith's four books of photographs taken in China during the late Qing Dynasty are considered the highlight. As a photographer and co-founder of a studio in Shanghai, Griffith has recorded different aspects of city life across the country since the 1870s."This is the first time we have discovered such a big body of work by the British photographer, David Knox Griffith," said Li Yi, general manager of Yingyi Auctions. "The pictures he took in Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao in the late 19th century are valuable records for studying Chinese history. We can also see clear clues of the photographer's career development through these four books of pictures," Li added.Contemporary photography is quite different. Modern artistic expressions and techniques are merged into a series featuring gardens in the city of Suzhou by Chinese photographer Hong Lei."They appear in the form of photographs, but the artist has actually re-created on the original pieces two or even three times, by hand coloring it, or sanding it to reflect changes in history," said Li.The most important element in contemporary art is the artist's inspiration and ideas in creation. It's quite different from the documentary type, which just captures real moments in life, Li concluded.(Cover: A picture of three women in the late Qing Dynasty, photographer unknown. /CGTN)The history of China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing, has long been studied by scholars and history fans around the world.

An interesting change for Chinese fashion this year is plenty of Chinese elements in garments, some of which are even intended for export.Ten-year-old clothing firm Hemu has always labeled itself a Chinese-style brand, and their new designs for this season's Shanghai Fashion Week have been inspired by one of the oldest Chinese classics, the "Classics of Mountains and Rivers" (Shan Hai Jing). The ancient book tells stories of mythic geography and beasts, and the designer has brought it all into his new collections, aimed primarily at young Chinese."The fashion industry can speak for Chinese culture. Though there are more foreign markets that like Chinese designs, that market still needs to be further developed. Our major consumers are still domestic buyers who love Eastern culture and traditional Chinese handcrafts," said Yang Fengrui, founder of Hemu.Hemu is not the only Chinese brand that is focusing on China Chic. Five-year-old Mukzin is running a special show this year, with designs inspired by traditional clothing from China's Qinghai Province. Plenty of the younger customers were pretty excited by the traditional Chinese elements on the show.Local buyers' enthusiasm for China Chic is reflected in the number of orders Mukzin has received since the show opened a week ago - they're up 70 percent from this season a year ago. The company's CEO said that one of the crucial reasons for the increasing popularity of Chinese-style clothing is the widespread popularity of traditional culture in modern film and television programs."TV dramas and TV shows have a large impact on the young. There are costume dramas and reality shows such as The Rap of China and Street Dance of China. Contestants' performances have Chinese cultural elements, and all of that has a subtle impact on consumers," said George Feng, CEO of Mukzin.Chinese elements were very prominent in the new designs debuted at this season's Shanghai Fashion Week. By showing them off at the fashion gala, the Chinese-style clothing is expected to draw in a wider range of international customers.Shanghai's Spring and Summer 2021 Fashion Week is now presenting the city's fashionistas with plenty of new design debuts.

Many stories depict farmers, describing the significant transformation of China's rural areas over the past 40 years and reflecting the twists and turns of their spiritual sublimation in the transformation.China's first rural-themed TV series, "Three Families," aired on China Central Television on May 22, 1978, marked the beginning of the development of TV series in the new era, which is also a reflection of the reform and opening-up of the countryside.The story of the three families revolves around a 100 yuan loan (about $63.4 back then). One of the families needs the money for their pig farm and one for their child's wedding. In those days, as little as 100 yuan could cause a big problem for the whole family.Since the middle and late 1980s, rural teleplays began to focus on the spiritual impact and transformation of farmers in the early stage of this historic transformation.Adapted from Han Zhijun's novel "Destiny Quartet," three-part TV drama "Rural Trilogy" has a different emphasis. The work not only describes the remarkable changes brought by the reform and opening-up of the countryside but also offers an in-depth look at how people deal with the challenges of adjusting to new modern values.Since 2003, rural-themed teleplays have ushered in the creation of the second bumper period. âLiu Laogen," "Ma Dashuai" and many other TV series are beginning to focus on migrant workers in cities.

Many of the themes focus on the impact of the nation's policies. More than that, TV shows are no longer limited by subject matter or time and have started to set their stories in a longer historical context."The Ordinary World," "White Deer Plain" and "The Old Farmer" combine the rural theme with drama narration, which adds a historical background and ideological depth to the works.(Top image designer: Pan Yufei.)The content changes of rural-themed teleplays are closely related to the history of rural reform and poverty alleviation in China.2020 is the year for China to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, which means that the root of poverty that has held Chinese people back for thousands of years will be cut off.In this great historical process, many TV series have been paying close attention to the countryside.

When did it begin? How is it being expressed? And how far will it go? You may find the answers in this special exhibition entitled, "Immaterial/Re-material: A Brief History of Computing Art" at the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.The past, present and future of computing art. This group exhibition at Beijing's UCCA has gathered more than 70 pieces by more than 30 artists from around the world, from pioneers of the 1960s to today's emerging voices. "The exhibition at UCCA is by far the largest exhibition dedicated to digital art so far, and I'm very proud that we present four generations of digital artists, of artists who invented new forms and new images to express a new vision of the world," Jerome Neutres, the curator, said in a prerecorded video at the opening.The title "Immaterial/Re-Material" pays tribute to Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard's groundbreaking 1985 exhibition "Les ImmatÃ©riaux," which conceived a new mode of art that reflected the decade's advances in telecommunications technology. By exploring the broad possibilities of computing art and the philosophies underpinning it, the exhibition aims to present the medium not just as a new media form but an entire artistic language.Interactive installations and AI learning is a recurring theme for participating artists.In this "Eye Calligraphy Project," artist Michel Paysant paints with his eyes using his eye tracker connected to an industrial robot equipped with a calligraphy brush. The force of thought and interior design help to realize the "digital calligraphies" of a new generation. Amid the global pandemic, artists believe that exploring computing art is a fitting topic, as technology has more closely connected us."What interests me most is taking this thing that exists in the digital world and bringing it into reality and presenting it as something that viewers can observe many different angles. So, it's not about imagery. It is not about text; it's really about something deeper that we respond to," said Leo Villareal, one of the participating artists."I think that's what we need right now in the world, things that bind us together, things that we can all connect to. So, that's where my work comes from, and I hope that it can help to dissolve some of these boundaries and some of the divisions we're experiencing in the world today."The exhibition runs until January 17, 2021. Computing art is gaining recognition as another medium of artistic expression.

Once depicting himself as the artist who really loves movies, he believes that films and art are inseparable.He won an Oscar for the best art direction in the martial arts blockbuster "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in 2001, making him more outstanding in the film industry than in other fields like theater, costume design and visual arts which he is also good at.Yip said before shooting this film, he spent a long time studying the art of dance in different dynasties in ancient China, and held many exhibitions as well as participated in many large-scale arts festivals in Europe."Films and arts are inseparable," he said, adding that he would spend a lot of time understanding how the director sees the world, which helps him decipher what kind of a world they would like to see. And after that, he will try to find the most lively and diverse ways to present what directors try to express in the film work.As for how Chinese cinema can become more international, Yip told CGTN that when the Chinese outshine foreign directors in arts, they will shoot films others can't compete with.He also said that director Wim Wenders is one of the famous directors in the world that has a great influence on his creation and personality. Inspired by the way he shot his notable documentary "Notebook On Cities &amp; Clothes (1989)," he noted that Wenders has changed the way to approach film documentaries. For example, the film "The Salt of the Earth" was shot in a dramatic way by presenting many striking photos.Apart from dedicating himself to the film industry, Yip has held many exhibitions showcasing his costumes, photographs, installations and videos across the globe. Yip once pointed out the concept of "New Orientalism" aesthetic, which has spanned across films, dance, theater and opera, and it is about conveying the aesthetic of unique Chinese culture to the international world."The 'New Orientalism' concept is not restricted to culture, it is open to all fields," he explained. "I have done a lot of study on the Chinese philosophy about 'Xu Shi Bing Zhi,' it is something like the existence and non-existence can come together."'The pandemic gives me more time to think'The COVID-19 pandemic might have badly hit the global film industry, but it has prompted many people to calm down and rethink the world and life."The pandemic on the other hand, gives me more time to think," he said, adding that prior to COVID-19, the world was moving at breakneck speed, forcing people to do many things at the same time. It was propelling people to rush forward. "While in the pandemic era, I have been forced to calm down and appreciate the depths of time."When it comes to what efforts should be made to adapt to climate change in the post-pandemic era, Yip noted that we should do something for our planet. When he was once invited to visit Norway, he said they could see shrinking glaciers, and they looked like "corpses" because there was electronic and kitchen waste in the water, which was a very serious matter. Reporter: She Jingwei Videographer: Danzeng Jiancuo Video editor: Chen ShiTim Yip, also known as Ye Jintian, the world-renowned art director, visual artist, stage and costume designer as well as the first Chinese to win an Academy Award, shared his views on arts and films with CGTN during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF) in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.'Films and arts are inseparable'Tim Yip has worked with many influential film directors and artists across the globe and is an Academy Award-winning art director.

Established in August 1958, Western Film Group, also known as Xi'an Film Studio, is one of the six major film groups in China.Among the national film production units, Xi'an Film Studio was the first to win the highest awards at international A-level film festivals. It has won more than 300 domestic and foreign awards, including Golden Palm Award, Golden Bear Award, Silver Lion Award in Cannes International Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival and Venice International Film, leading the country. It also has the most number of film exports in the country. Some of its representative films include "Farewell My Concubine," "Old Well," "Red Sorghum," "Tuya's Marriage," "Beautiful Feet," "My 1919," and "A Chinese Odyssey" series. Moreover, a large number of top Chinese directors and movie stars have worked with Xi'an Film Studio, such as Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, Gu Changwei, Gong Li and Chen Chong.The Belt and Road in Film PostersDuring the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF), Xi'an Film Studio is hosting several forums and events, including an exhibition titled "The Belt and Road in Film Posters." On display are a range of original film posters collected by the studio from all over the world in the past five years. The design, aesthetics and psychology of the posters reflect the nature of the films as well as the times in which they were released. At the same time, these posters reflect the hundred-year history of the ever-changing film industry.The exhibition is divided into five sections: The Earliest Film Posters, European and American Film Posters, Original Drawn Posters, Hong Kong Film Posters, and Xi'an Film Studio Classic Film Posters.The Earliest Film PostersThese film posters originated from commercial posters. There were hand-painted or lithographic-printed in the beginning. Painted in original colors, they have different sizes, from extra small to extra large. This exhibition has the smallest movie poster in the world, about 6 square cm, as well as the largest poster in the world, composed of two A0 posters.In the early 20th century, Thomas Edison united many studios to form a film patent alliance, which established the earliest specifications and standards for film posters.In this context, also on display is the incorrect version of the poster of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" â it shows Snow White with six dwarfs.European and American Film PostersIt also features various styles of posters from Europe and the U.S., such as classic Hollywood, surrealism and so on. With increasing cultural exchanges, the artistic styles of film posters influenced each other, thereby enriching the artistry of film posters.In this section, Xi'an Film Studio has created special corners for Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe and the film "Singin' in the Rain."It also exhibits the scooter that Audrey Hepburn rode with Gregory Peck in "Roman Holiday," brought all the way from Italy to Xi'an.Also on display is the most beautiful movie poster in the world â a poster designed by German artist Heinz for the classic silent film "Metropolis."Original Drawn PostersAs film posters were originally hand-painted â vivid with a strong sense of storytelling â many became collectible items. Appreciating a hand-painted film poster is just like appreciating a painting.Hong Kong Film PostersHong Kong Film Posters have their unique regional style. Because of the limited cinema space, these posters are usually small with superimposed pictures of the featuring artists. This is specially true for martial arts films made in Hong Kong, as the well-known Shaw Brothers Pictures, Golden Harvest Pictures and the likes brought Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and other such famous names to fame.Xi'an Film Studio Classic Film PostersXi'an Film Studio has a time-honored legacy and intentional reputation of winning more than 300 awards from China and abroad. It has ushered Chinese films to the world and was the cradle of the fifth generation of directors in China. Many posters created for those classic films produced by Xi'an Film Studio have been exhibited.Car and Film ExhibitionCars and films, two great gifts of the 19th century, have had a tremendous impact on human society. Cars change people's speed of travel, while films affect people's thoughts. When cars drive into films, they are not only props, but also vivid characters showing speed and passion, romance and elegance, technology and innovation. All sorts of classic cars exhibited at Xi'an Film Studio museum have participated in films made by the studio, such as "The Xi'an Incident."The Cine Film LibraryThe Cine Film Library stores a large number of films, including clip materials, formal copies and magnetic recording, serving as a hub of storage, protection, restoration and loan. So far, the library has collected various genres of films and resources, totaling 18,356 copies, including 9,595 copies of material, 6,875 copies of remaining clips and 1,886 copies of magnetic recording.Experiencing 'A Chinese Odyssey'The most fun part of the exhibition is a tour to experience "A Chinese Odyssey", allowing audiences to interact with characters in the movie and go through classic scenes in the movie, such as Bak Jing-Jing's horrifying skeleton hole, almost like a mini version of Universal. A Chinese Odyssey is a two-part 1995 Hong Kong fantasy-comedy film directed by Jeffery Lau and starring Stephen Chow. The film is very loosely based on the 16th-century Wu Cheng'en novel "Journey to the West." Most of the movie scenes were shot in Xi'an Film Studio.This exhibition is a heaven for film lovers and even for escape-room game fans (the Odyssey part).

What some might herald as triumphant regeneration can seem to others like a triumphalist celebration of power; well-meaning schemes to clean up deprived areas can often sweep away what made them vibrant neighborhoods to begin with. There is also the question of taste and style, and the inherent problems when changing fashions are applied not to clothing but to buildings, which should be rather more permanent but are often victim to the sweeping statements of incoming ideologues. Infamously, the Modernist-influenced reconstruction of social housing in the third quarter of the 20th century in the UK especially raised unloved "streets in the sky" by razing the sort of centrally located terraced houses that are now highly prized, and therefore highly expensive, as family homes.   However, those allegedly Modernist high-rises owed much less to architectural idealism than they did to manufacturing opportunism, in particular the cheap modular techniques keenly adopted by cash-conscious authorities. When cheap construction caused expensive problems â many 1960s projects have required extensive renovation or expensive replacement â the blame was laid upon the idea rather than the practice, the form rather than the content. It needn't be that way, and perhaps the impending "green" renovation of Europe's ageing building stock can be based upon more permanent foundations, conceived with the longest-term plans in mind. Reconstruction timeOn September 16, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the EU's new Green Deal would have high ideals. While one major strand of the ecological plan â to cut carbon emissions by 55 percent before 2030 â was reducing vehicle emissions, Von der Leyen was also eyeing the very architecture of Europe. "Our buildings generate 40 percent of our emissions," she noted. "They need to become less wasteful, less expensive and more sustainable. We know that the construction sector can even be turned from a carbon source into a carbon sink, if organic building materials like wood and smart technologies like AI are applied."The aims are eye-wateringly large. According to the EU's stocktaking, "more than 220 million buildings, representing approximately 85 percent of the building stock, were built before 2001." Europe has a lot of buildings, but the European Union has a lot of money to throw at them â the cost of the Green Deal has been estimated as at least $1.18 trillion as Europe aims to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.   One proposed schedule for the "Renovation Wave" of retrofitting buildings would update 2 percent of the continent's building stock every year. Building work on such a huge scale represents an enormous risk â or opportunity. As Von der Leyen said: "This is not just an environmental or economic project, it needs to be a new cultural project for Europe." Luckily, Europe is rich in cultural history, and has done this sort of thing before â which is where the Bauhaus idea comes in. "Every movement has its own look and feel," said Von der Leyen, "and we need to give our systemic change its own distinct aesthetic â to match style with sustainability. "This is why we will set up a new European Bauhaus â a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers [and] designers work together to make that happen." A 'new Bauhaus'But what exactly is this new Bauhaus? According to Von der Leyen: "The New European Bauhaus movement is intended to be a bridge between the world of science and technology and the world of art and culture. It is about a new European Green Deal aesthetic combining good design with sustainability."Wednesday's parliamentary question-and-answer session attempted to set out more details, although some of the answers raised yet more questions. The new Bauhaus "will be an interdisciplinary project, co-steered by an advisory board of external experts including scientists, architects, designers, artists, planners and civil society that will create experimental spaces where art, culture, science and technology can imagine, test and demonstrate new solutions."So far, so inclusive. The expansive ideals will go across multiple disciplines: "All Bauhaus projects would deal with the built environment as a whole but would focus on different aspects, such as climate challenges, accessibility, social cohesion, digital construction, sustainable bio-resources etc... and be in different countries."  As such, the new Bauhaus is described as an "accelerator for affordable and aesthetically promising green and digital solutions, technologies and products." Welcoming proposals, the Commission will "conduct a broad participatory co-creation process."For the time being, then, it is something of a talking shop as it attempts to create a unified ethos and aesthetic from the notoriously competitive world of architecture. There may be a lot of discussion before we start to see a style emerging. But that's not to say the project is heading into a slow death by eternal committee: there is a timeline, and there are even construction plans set in stone, if not environmentally unfriendly concrete. That "broad participatory co-creation process" will only last until summer 2021, with "delivery" starting in the second half of 2021. Intriguingly, the Commission mentions "the setting up of a network of five founding Bauhaus[es] in 2022." With further expansion possible: "In a second wave, further Bauhaus[es] can be added across the EU and even globally."At this point, the New Bauhaus steps off the drawing board and into the real world. It is described as "a forum for discussion, a space for art and culture, an experimentation lab, an accelerator, a hub for global networks and experts, a contact point for citizens interested in the topic."It seems that the new-Bauhaus idea is not simply a useful branding tool â a quick comparison to a well-known previous conceptual movement â but a reference to an actual building, or buildings. And that's entirely fitting for the heritage of the name. Unlike, say, Art Nouveau or Futurism, the original Bauhaus was literally a school: an art school, founded in Weimar in the aftermath of a world-shaking event.  The old BauhausThat Bauhaus (German for "building house") is now identified as a minimalist style is somewhat ironic given the widespread aims of its founders. Although it was founded by architect Walter Gropius â a year after the end of World War I in 1919 â the Staatliches Bauhaus art school always combined fine arts with crafts and espoused a Gesamtkunstwerk ("comprehensive artwork"), a common aesthetic that intended to unify all the arts. Indeed, Bauhaus output would eventually span architecture, graphic design, interior design, art, typography and industrial design â the latter being entirely fitting for a theory that attempted to marry individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production revolutionizing capitalism. As with the EU's Green Deal, these were high ideals applied to necessary situations. As Gropius put it, "An object is defined by its nature. In order, then, to design it to function correctly â a container, a chair, or a house â one must first of all study its nature: For it must serve its purpose perfectly, that is, it must fulfil its function usefully, be durable, economical, and 'beautiful.'"  That last word perhaps referenced William Morris, the 19th-century English designer whose golden rule was "Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful." For Bauhaus, there was no need to decide between beauty and use, between function and form: the everyday could be rendered sublime through the right marriage of utility and appearance, usually stripped down and presented without artifice.Widely popular across Europe and the world, Bauhaus design was eventually reflected in everything from Wassily chairs to Olivetti typewriters and, most lastingly, Modernist architecture. That the EU has evoked its name is perhaps designed to recall a brief time when the whole continent was united in the thrilling possibilities of a sleek new future with more opportunity than threat. There is, however, a sad end to the Bauhaus tale. In 1933, by which time it had relocated to Berlin, the Bauhaus was closed down by the newly elected Nazi party, for which it represented cosmopolitanism, liberalism and degeneracy. The Nazis had a very different aesthetic, a more traditional and reactionary Romanticist throwback to an illusory golden age. Adolf Hitler encouraged his favored architect Albert Speer to concoct designs for the reconstruction of Berlin as a New Rome, an aesthetically illiterate toy box of domes and triumphal arches, which was never to see the light of day. History proves that not every overarching architectural plan is well received or even well conceived. But in throwing open its doors to the best of new ideas, hopefully the EU's new Bauhaus will help to future-proof the continent's building stock for our new millennium â while putting in place ecological targets to make sure it isn't our last.Grand architectural plans are not always viewed well by history. What some might herald as triumphant regeneration can seem to others like a triumphalist celebration of power; well-meaning schemes to clean up deprived areas can often sweep away what made them vibrant neighborhoods to begin with. There is also the question of taste and style, and the inherent problems when changing fashions are applied not to clothing but to buildings, which should be rather more permanent but are often victim to the sweeping statements of incoming ideologues. Infamously, the Modernist-influenced reconstruction of social housing in the third quarter of the 20th century in the UK especially raised unloved "streets in the sky" by razing the sort of centrally located terraced houses that are now highly prized, and therefore highly expensive, as family homes.   However, those allegedly Modernist high-rises owed much less to architectural idealism than they did to manufacturing opportunism, in particular the cheap modular techniques keenly adopted by cash-conscious authorities. When cheap construction caused expensive problems â many 1960s projects have required extensive renovation or expensive replacement â the blame was laid upon the idea rather than the practice, the form rather than the content. It needn't be that way, and perhaps the impending "green" renovation of Europe's ageing building stock can be based upon more permanent foundations, conceived with the longest-term plans in mind. Reconstruction timeOn September 16, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the EU's new Green Deal would have high ideals. While one major strand of the ecological plan â to cut carbon emissions by 55 percent before 2030 â was reducing vehicle emissions, Von der Leyen was also eyeing the very architecture of Europe. "Our buildings generate 40 percent of our emissions," she noted. "They need to become less wasteful, less expensive and more sustainable. We know that the construction sector can even be turned from a carbon source into a carbon sink, if organic building materials like wood and smart technologies like AI are applied."The aims are eye-wateringly large. According to the EU's stocktaking, "more than 220 million buildings, representing approximately 85 percent of the building stock, were built before 2001." Europe has a lot of buildings, but the European Union has a lot of money to throw at them â the cost of the Green Deal has been estimated as at least $1.18 trillion as Europe aims to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.   One proposed schedule for the "Renovation Wave" of retrofitting buildings would update 2 percent of the continent's building stock every year. Building work on such a huge scale represents an enormous risk â or opportunity. As Von der Leyen said: "This is not just an environmental or economic project, it needs to be a new cultural project for Europe." Luckily, Europe is rich in cultural history, and has done this sort of thing before â which is where the Bauhaus idea comes in. "Every movement has its own look and feel," said Von der Leyen, "and we need to give our systemic change its own distinct aesthetic â to match style with sustainability. "This is why we will set up a new European Bauhaus â a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers [and] designers work together to make that happen." A 'new Bauhaus'But what exactly is this new Bauhaus? According to Von der Leyen: "The New European Bauhaus movement is intended to be a bridge between the world of science and technology and the world of art and culture. It is about a new European Green Deal aesthetic combining good design with sustainability."Wednesday's parliamentary question-and-answer session attempted to set out more details, although some of the answers raised yet more questions. The new Bauhaus "will be an interdisciplinary project, co-steered by an advisory board of external experts including scientists, architects, designers, artists, planners and civil society that will create experimental spaces where art, culture, science and technology can imagine, test and demonstrate new solutions."So far, so inclusive. The expansive ideals will go across multiple disciplines: "All Bauhaus projects would deal with the built environment as a whole but would focus on different aspects, such as climate challenges, accessibility, social cohesion, digital construction, sustainable bio-resources etc... and be in different countries."  As such, the new Bauhaus is described as an "accelerator for affordable and aesthetically promising green and digital solutions, technologies and products." Welcoming proposals, the Commission will "conduct a broad participatory co-creation process."For the time being, then, it is something of a talking shop as it attempts to create a unified ethos and aesthetic from the notoriously competitive world of architecture. There may be a lot of discussion before we start to see a style emerging. But that's not to say the project is heading into a slow death by eternal committee: there is a timeline, and there are even construction plans set in stone, if not environmentally unfriendly concrete. That "broad participatory co-creation process" will only last until summer 2021, with "delivery" starting in the second half of 2021. Intriguingly, the Commission mentions "the setting up of a network of five founding Bauhaus[es] in 2022." With further expansion possible: "In a second wave, further Bauhaus[es] can be added across the EU and even globally."At this point, the New Bauhaus steps off the drawing board and into the real world. It is described as "a forum for discussion, a space for art and culture, an experimentation lab, an accelerator, a hub for global networks and experts, a contact point for citizens interested in the topic."It seems that the new-Bauhaus idea is not simply a useful branding tool â a quick comparison to a well-known previous conceptual movement â but a reference to an actual building, or buildings. And that's entirely fitting for the heritage of the name. Unlike, say, Art Nouveau or Futurism, the original Bauhaus was literally a school: an art school, founded in Weimar in the aftermath of a world-shaking event.  The old BauhausThat Bauhaus (German for "building house") is now identified as a minimalist style is somewhat ironic given the widespread aims of its founders. Although it was founded by architect Walter Gropius â a year after the end of World War I in 1919 â the Staatliches Bauhaus art school always combined fine arts with crafts and espoused a Gesamtkunstwerk ("comprehensive artwork"), a common aesthetic that intended to unify all the arts. Indeed, Bauhaus output would eventually span architecture, graphic design, interior design, art, typography and industrial design â the latter being entirely fitting for a theory that attempted to marry individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production revolutionizing capitalism. As with the EU's Green Deal, these were high ideals applied to necessary situations. As Gropius put it, "An object is defined by its nature. In order, then, to design it to function correctly â a container, a chair, or a house â one must first of all study its nature: For it must serve its purpose perfectly, that is, it must fulfil its function usefully, be durable, economical, and 'beautiful.'"  That last word perhaps referenced William Morris, the 19th-century English designer whose golden rule was "Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful."

You may know Luosifen (stinky sour snail noodles). But you may have never imagined KFC will sell Luosifen someday.KFC China has announced the launch of a range of pre-packaged, fast-cooking items categorized as "Kaifengcai," which include chicken Luosifen, chicken breast and chicken soup.Starting October 12, KFC stores in 23 Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, have been selling chicken breast and chicken soup, while chicken Luosifen won't be available until October 26.According to KFC China, the "Kaifengcai" series is only designed for take-away and not dine-in. It's aimed at "inviting young people to enjoy hands-on cooking pleasure" via dishes' self-heating packaging, according to the KFC announcement.Originating in Liuzhou, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in the 1970s, Luosifen served as a cheap street snack that people outside of the city knew little about. It was not until 2012 when a hit Chinese food documentary, "A Bite of China," featured it and it became a household name.Combining the elements of dishes made by Han people with those of the Miao and Dong ethnic groups, Luosifen comprises rice noodles boiled with pickled bamboo shoots, dried turnip, fresh vegetables and peanuts in spicy river snail soup. It is sour, spicy, salty, hot and stinky after being boiled.There's been a "fever of Luosifen" in the catering industry in recent years, both inside and outside of China. Many food manufacturers have launched products with Luosifen flavor, such as mooncake and hotpot.Meanwhile, Luosifen worth around 7.5 million yuan (about $1.1 million) was exported from Liuzhou from January to June this year. That's eight times the total export value in 2019.KFC's move marks its latest step in the localization of its menus in China."As a leading fast-food chain, KFC is really quick in making products catering to local flavors. Luosifen is one of the most popular foods among young Chinese people. The KFC certainly hopes to attract more customers through this move," said Zhu Danpeng, an analyst in the Chinese food industry.You may know KFC. You may know Luosifen (stinky sour snail noodles).

earth around 150 million years ago was sold at a Paris auction house on Tuesday for 3 million euros ($3.52 million).The skeleton of the Allosaurus dinosaur, dug up in the U.S. state of Wyoming three years ago, went to an unnamed foreign buyer for well in excess of the 1 million euro starting price."This is a high grade specimen," said Iacopo Briano, a palaeontologist who acted as a consultant to the Binoche et Giquello auction house which conducted the sale.The specimen is unusual because it is so complete: around 70 percent of the bones are present, and they were found aligned with each other, making it easier to reconnect them during the restoration process.The restored skeleton stands 3.5 meters (11 feet) high and 10 meters long. The ribcage bears the marks of what the auctioneers said may have been an attack by a rival Allosaurus or a predator.(Cover: A skeleton of an Allosaurus dinosaur is on display at Drouot auction house on October 12, 2020, in Paris, France. /CFP)The

He also answered questions on creativity in filmmaking from the press.What do you think of the impact of the pandemic on filmmakers?I believe that some filmmakers will pay attention to public health topics in the future. The pandemic has an impact on all aspects of our lives, not just filmmaking. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, I felt that I and the people around me were very healthy, but now that we are so vulnerable with the pandemic, I hope that with the advancement of science and technology, we can better deal with the pandemic.Most of your movies are related to daily life, does this have anything to do with your perspective on the world?When I recall things in life, there may be some things that are repetitive, not so attractive to put in movies. Sometimes when a small crisis occurs, it will be meaningful to transform it into a movie theme.For example, two people are having dinner in a restaurant and chatting. This is very daily and not interesting to put into a movie. But for example, these two people are a couple and are about to divorce. And this is the last dinner before the divorce. That would be something dramatic enough to put into a movie. It is different from an ordinary dinner, and can convey a meaning.What is your general creative process?I usually have an idea in my mind. It might be a picture or a fragment that appears in my mind. Many times I start with a very small idea. It might stay in my mind for a long time. Some ideas are constantly changing and maturing. If I think these ideas or fragments are suitable for film expression, I will enrich them and turn them into movies. For example, this idea is related to social concerns, can reflect some social problems, and psychologically caters to the needs of the audience, I will turn it into a movie. But some ideas may only have meaning from one angle, and I will not turn this idea into a movie. When creating a screenplay, I will first describe the outline of the story, and I will gradually enrich it during the creation. In the beginning, I would not imagine the end of the film, the screenplay creation would take a long time, I wouldn't start filming before the screenplay is matured. For example, I have an idea of a young man traveling to northern Iran, he might meet a lot of people, and many things might happen. At the beginning, I would not specifically imagine what things would happen, and who is he going to encounter. I would enrich these when writing the screenplay.What is realistic cinema?The word realistic itself has very rich meanings. Some movies are called realistic movies, which are just superficially realistic, not actually realistic. After I worked in the film industry for a while, my understanding of realistic cinema is to pay attention to people's daily lives. This is realistic cinema. I discussed this with directors in China before, for example, a friend of yours called you and said that he hadnât seen you for a long time and wanted to have tea with you. You were very happy when you received the call and you guys chatted over tea happily, he said that he wanted to start a journey. This is daily life, there is no conflict or contradiction, this is not a movie story. But for example, letâs say this friend died suddenly in a car accident during the trip, elements for a movie came into being. We need to find usable fragments from our lives and make artistic creations.You have experiences directing in French and Spanish. How do you master foreign language creation?In my films, I try to show life in Iran as much as possible. Creating films in Persian, expressing the problems of our society is simpler. If I go to other countries, my habits are different, languages are different, and social environments are different. I have made two films abroad but I still feel that art films are closely integrated with society and culture. When I create films for my own country and for my own audience, the job is simpler. In other countries, there might be creative difficulties.How do you deal with the difference between director and audience's perspective over a movie?These two perspectives are difficult to separate. As film directors, we always think about the audiences. Actually, we are the first audiences of our own films. I don't judge in movies, I just convey. For example, in The Past, we have two protagonists, an Iranian and a French. I am an Iranian. In my creation, some of my emotions are closer to the Iranian role. I know how he would think. But for the French, it is not that close. But in the creation of the screenplay, I try not to favor anyone, and do not judge anyone's behavior. The audience should be the one to judge. I will not give audiences my judgment during the filming.How do you balance the commercial success of a film and the pursuit of artistic expression? Movies need to have commercial success on the one hand, and the pursuit of artistic expression on the other. Many artistic films are not liked by the audiences, unfortunately. In many cases, the audiences and the professional film critics are not the same group. Some of my own films are fortunately welcomed by the audiences. I think there are two reasons: one is drama and the other is reality. Both of these can make a film interesting and attractive.Some artistic films have weak plot connections, and the director needs to connect the plots in a realistic narrative so that the audience can relate to their lives in order to attract them. Plots are like pearls in the ocean, we need to string them well to make it work. Arrange them randomly would make the audience feel that these things cannot happen in their daily life, so they won't like them. Expressing life and be full of drama, at the same time, can attract ordinary audiences. And only with dramatic plots that reflect social issues can we achieve artistic success.Asghar Farhadi was born in 1972 in Iran. He became interested in cinema when he was a teenager and started his education in filmmaking by joining the Youth Cinema Society of Esfahan in 1986, where he made 8mm and 16mm short films. He received his Bachelors in Theater from the School of Dramatic Arts at Tehran University in 1998 and his Masters in Stage Direction a few years later.Farhadi made his directorial debut with "Dance In The Dust" in 2003, and a year later, he made "Beautiful City." His third film, "Fireworks Wednesday," won the Gold Hugo at the 2006 Chicago International Film Festival. His fourth film, "About Elly," made in 2009, won the Silver Bear for Best Director at 59 Berlin International Film Festival as well as Best Picture at Tribeca Film Festival. This movie was also Iran's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film competition of Academy Awards in 2009. His next film, "A Separation," became a sensation in 2011. It got critical acclaim inside and outside Iran. Roger Ebert called it "the best picture of the year," and it received both the Golden Bear and the Silver Bear for Best Actor and Best Actress at the Berlin International Film Festival. The film also won Best Foreign Language Film from The Boston Society of Film Critics, the Chicago and Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Board of Review, the Golden Globes, the Cesar Award, the Independent Spirit Award, and ultimately the Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, making him the first Iranian filmmaker ever to win an Oscar.Farhadi made his sixth movie "The Past" in France. Lead actress Berenice Bejo won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival. "The Past"  was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the Best Foreign Language Film and won the National Board of Reviews' Best Foreign Language Film award. The film was also nominated in five categories of the Cesar Film Festival, including Directing, Best Script and Best Actress. His 2016 movie, "The Salesman," won the Best Screenplay Award at the 69th Cannes Film Festival and brought home the second Oscar for Iran in the Best Foreign Language Film category. Two-time Oscar-winning Iranian director Asghar Farhadi shared his knowledge with young Chinese directors in an online masterclass during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF), focusing on realistic cinema in his creative works. He also answered questions on creativity in filmmaking from the press.What do you think of the impact of the pandemic on filmmakers?I believe that some filmmakers will pay attention to public health topics in the future. The pandemic has an impact on all aspects of our lives, not just filmmaking. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, I felt that I and the people around me were very healthy, but now that we are so vulnerable with the pandemic, I hope that with the advancement of science and technology, we can better deal with the pandemic.Most of your movies are related to daily life, does this have anything to do with your perspective on the world?When I recall things in life, there may be some things that are repetitive, not so attractive to put in movies. Sometimes when a small crisis occurs, it will be meaningful to transform it into a movie theme.For example, two people are having dinner in a restaurant and chatting. This is very daily and not interesting to put into a movie. But for example, these two people are a couple and are about to divorce. And this is the last dinner before the divorce. That would be something dramatic enough to put into a movie. It is different from an ordinary dinner, and can convey a meaning.What is your general creative process?I usually have an idea in my mind. It might be a picture or a fragment that appears in my mind. Many times I start with a very small idea. It might stay in my mind for a long time. Some ideas are constantly changing and maturing. If I think these ideas or fragments are suitable for film expression, I will enrich them and turn them into movies.

An exhibition in Beijing unravels its mystery and history.These are eye-witnesses of the evolution of Chinese civilization from the third to the ninth century. Rather than curated by chronology or geography, the 200 or so ceramic objects are arranged into four subjects: Anchoret, Sutra, Alchemy and Lions. Each concept represents a significant cultural, social or historical aspect of the period."Anchoret" refers to powerful and influential families who had for generations held important official positions in the Wei, Jin and Northern and Southern dynasties. At the beginning of the third century, the scholar-officer clan, who failed in its pursuit of the official career, grew skeptical of Confucian ethics. "They began pursuing a more philosophical, seclusive way of living, advocating for individual liberation and spiritual freedom.

As a result, Buddhist images were highly recognized in ceramic art during this period.In ancient times, most ceramic objects served as tools of production, daily utensils or funeral items. They were not endowed with aesthetic values like they are today. But this gradually changed as techniques developed.

We cannot wait for that first downbeat!" she said.The Phil said it estimates a net loss of approximately 10 million U.S. dollars in the most recent fiscal year, as well as a loss of 20 million dollars in ticket revenue from the canceled 2020-21 season.Nearly half of the administrative staff has been furloughed or laid off, and staff making more than 100,000 dollars a year have pay cuts up to 30 percent.A Philharmonic spokesperson told AFP the organization is in negotiations with musicians but declined to comment on specifics per its agreement with the union.Currently symphony musicians are receiving 75 percent of their base pay, about 2,200 dollars a week. Those who normally earn salaries above base are receiving 35 percent of overscale.The prolonged lull at Lincoln Center's David Geffen Hall, the Manhattan stage where the Phil performs, could provide time for long-planned renovations.The acoustic overhaul of the facility first opened in 1962 was slated for opening in May 2022, with an estimated cost of 550 million dollars.The New York Philharmonic has canceled all shows through mid-June 2021 over the coronavirus pandemic, the first time the 178-year-old institution has been forced to scrap an entire season.The famed symphony said it made the decision â the latest blow to live music, coming after similar moves by Broadway and the city's Metropolitan Opera â on the advice of health officials.The Phil vowed to continue offering free digital content and said it would announce an expanded winter and spring orchestra streaming series at a later date.The company also said in the spring it would reboot its newly minted outdoor pop-up series, which found success this fall and features small ensembles who play free shows in parks and on street corners throughout the city on weekends."The cancellation of an entire New York Philharmonic season is not only unprecedented â it is devastating, both in its impact on the morale of musicians and audiences, and in its profound economic consequences," said the institution's President and CEO Deborah Borda, adding there was "no other choice.""This will not be a silent season, and we eagerly anticipate September 2021, when the entire Orchestra can reunite with our audience.

The trend for colored stones has increased as an asset class by the super rich in recent years.Mined by Russian diamond producer Alrosa, the 14.83-carat diamond was cut from the largest pink crystal ever found in Russia, Sotheby's said."The occurrence of pink diamonds in nature is extremely rare in any size. Only one percent of all pink diamonds are larger than 10-carats," said Gary Schuler, worldwide chairman of Sotheby's jewelry division.Naturally colored diamonds occur because they posses a particular lattice structure that refracts light to produce colored, rather than white, stones.Pink diamonds are both rare and aesthetically highly prized by collectors, analysts say.The gem is being shown in Singapore and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan region before being auctioned in Geneva on November 11.An extremely rare, vivid purple-pink diamond mined in Russia is expected to fetch up to $38 million when it goes under the hammer on November 11, the auction house Sotheby's said on Monday.The oval gem, which is named after the Russian ballet "The Spirit of the Rose," is the largest of its kind to be offered at auction.

Adapted from real events and told through the lens of volleyball legend Lang Ping, it offers a unique glimpse into some of the contentious issues that have compounded her complicated legacy.And therein lies the novelty."'Leap' is distinguished from other patriotic movies in the way that it treats characters in a rather refreshing way while injecting the story with fresh narratives and far-reaching hints," Jing, a movie reviewer who runs his own review website, told CGTN.In recent years, China's entertainment industry has been flooded with movies featuring historical events effusing patriotic sentiments. Making billions in box-office revenues, these movies are beloved by Chinese cinema-goers.While some of these are repetitive, they serve a purpose. "We do need these movies to convey some messages," said Li Jing, another freelance movie reviewer.But "stories need to be told in a way that characters are fully formed," Li explained. "'Leap' is not perfect, but it shows the effort of focusing the narrative on an intricate character."A standard Chinese patriotic movie tends to emphasize individual sacrifices for the collective, but "Leap" did not follow that path, according to Jing. "I believe Peter Ho-sun Chan, the movie director, was more keen on examining the reconciliation between individual fulfillment and collective interests. It transcends the idea that war-time blockbusters are the only type of movies that audiences like."Lang was an indefatigable player in the national women's team when China was just opening up to the outside world in the 1980s. At a time when patriotism was running high and winning sports events on the global stage signified tremendous national pride, Lang and her team secured thrilling victories â including a world championship title and Olympic gold â that still reverberate across the country.After taking up a coaching career in the U.S. and successfully guiding the U.S. national team to notable victories, she returned to China and was determined to lead the struggling Chinese national team back to its peak. But by then, she was no longer just a patriot elated by winning glory for her country, but had become a seasoned, reserved coach accustomed to both victory or defeat.And "Leap" touches on the contentious theme underlying that change: her questioning of China's sports system, where top athletes are required to devote all their energy to their sport but are not prepared for life after their career is over."'Leap' not only acknowledges the fading trend of patriotism in contemporary China, a cause for the loss of spirit that once motivated athletes of older generations, but also hints at Lang's change in attitude towards volleyball as well as the drawbacks of China's sports system," Jing said. "In this respect, Chan approaches these topics with full honesty."Lang suffered permanent injuries due to strenuous training in her early career as an athlete. Even now, she still holds a disability certificate in the U.S.. But before she left China for an overseas coaching career, she was allegedly refused reimbursement for some costly medical bills by the Chinese volleyball association."Chan is very adept at presenting individualism as the product of our time. One of his signature movies in the 1990s, 'Comrades: Almost a Love Story,' depicts a woman who puts her self-interest above others," said Li."In 'Leap,' we can see the unraveling of the same discussion. Though bound to offend some in the audience, this is the sharp reflection of reality," Li added."Leap" follows a number of other bold and thought-provoking films that have come out in recent years.The 2018 movie "The Shadow Play" by Lou Ye took a sharp look at the pervasive practices of forced relocation. "Dying to survive" by Wen Muye, also released in 2018, offers a critical view of China's medical system."Dearest," another one of Chan's works, provocatively dove into the issues surrounding child abduction and did not shun away from the problematic ramifications of China's birth control policies."These movies turned out to be more popular and often received good reviews," noted Jing."Leap" topped the Chinese box office in the first week of its release and has already made 700 million yuan ($104.19 million) since then.Despite speculation that China's censorship system is tightening its grip on the movie industry, a growing number of movie makers have been toeing the line of what is acceptable to the film censors.Lou Ye, director of "The Shadow Play," is known to have challenged the censorship system for years. One of his principles for filmmaking, as he himself has stated, is "not to give up on making movies that push the boundaries, as long as they don't cross the line."These directors are feeding new blood into China's movie industry.Long known for its patriotic movies and action blockbusters, China's film industry has lately witnessed a more invigorating trend powered by poignant, captivating stories."Leap," the story of China's Olympic winning women's volleyball team, which made its domestic debut last month, is one movie representing this new chapter.

In 2015, China established the Girls' and Women's Education Award with UNESCO, and Peng mentioned that there are millions of people who devote their life for the education of girls and women in China.  Zhang Guimei is one of them. She is a female teacher who has taught in the poor mountainous areas of Southwest China's Yunnan Province for over 40 years. She established the first full-tuition-free girl high school in China, which helps many young girls from poverty-stricken families receive education. This year, 1.5 billion students have been forced to suspend classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Peng, and this impact on girls is particularly pronounced. We need to find ways to help those girls get back to school so that they won't be left behind due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sixty-three percent of illiterate adults around the world are women, said Peng, and the education of girls and women is of great benefit to the present and the future. China will continue to work with UNESCO to ensure the success of the Girls' and Women's Education Awards from 2021 to 2025, and make greater contributions to promoting girls' and women's education and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, Peng added. Audrey Azoulay, director-general of UNESCO, thanked the Chinese government for supporting the establishment of Girls' and Women's Education Awards. The UNESCO Prize for Girls' and Women's Education honors outstanding and innovative contributions made by individuals, institutions and organizations to advance girls' and women's education. China's First Lady Peng Liyuan, also United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) special envoy for the advancement of girls' and women's education, sent a congratulatory message to the award of UNESCO via a video on October 12. In her message, Peng expressed congratulations to prize-winners from Sri Lanka and Kenya.

Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home. Jason Huth, an English teacher in Beijing, was one who decided not to travel during the holiday. "I chose to stay for a few reasons; partly because I had just got back to Beijing a few weeks ago after being stuck abroad since Chinese New Year, partly because my school strongly advised teachers not to travel too far away from Beijing due to fears of having to quarantine upon return."Many international schools and companies advised staff against travel during the break. Aletta Magrieta Strauss, a Beijing-based art teacher, said she thought this was reasonable. "If there was an outbreak and I had to quarantine as a result, work would not cover the cost. They (international schools) have already lost a lot of money and are still trying to get staff back into China."With many people having extra money to spend due to not traveling earlier in the year, and with the onus being on safety and comfort, high-end hotels saw a boom in business. Of all hotel bookings made on Trip.com during the October holiday, four- and five-star accommodation accounted for nearly half. It's anticipated that the effect will be lasting, as more people get used to the idea of "luxury staycations."This year's October holiday saw a resurgence in domestic tourism, with 637 million trips being recorded in eight days.

Soprano Zhang Liping and baritone He Leiming, both natives of Wuhan, sang with the Chorus of the Wuhan Conservatory of Music and Beijing Music Association Chorus.Earlier this year, the people of Wuhan and of the rest of China fought the coronavirus pandemic with solidarity and eventually won the battle. "We need to remember this time, reflect the disaster, respect lives and honor civilization," said Zou Ye, who composed the eight-movement symphony."'Dedicated to 2020' is the first large-scale (symphony) work paying tribute to the fight against the coronavirus epidemic," said Yu Long, chairman of the Beijing Music Festival Art Committee."The musicians of the Wuhan Philharmonic Orchestra were engaged in non-musical community work during the epidemic. Each musician is like a soldier. Musicians turn musical instruments into weapons on the stage and provide spiritual support for people. They were also soldiers fighting on the front line of the epidemic," he added.Beijing Music Festival hits both offline and onlineUnder the theme "The Music Must Go On," the Beijing Music Festival is offering 20 offline performances and 240 hours of non-stop online audio and video programs through the mobile application BMF Club.This year marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven and to commemorate the musician, 10 young award-winning violinists, including Xie Haoming, Chen Yige and Jiang Yiliang, have been invited to present 10 of Beethoven's violin sonatas on stage from October 12 to 14.The online offerings, a new addition in the wake of the pandemic, include over 2,000 pieces of music as well as specially-made programs.On each of the festival's 10 nights, the program "Nessun dorma" will invite a Chinese opera singer to introduce some great operas spanning from the Baroque period to the 21st century.

Let art and artists get the respect they deserve," he added.The festival will close on October 20 with a concert themed "We Were Born in 2000" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the China Philharmonic Orchestra.

The most dominant is a group called the Han, who make up more than 90 percent of the mainland's population.Traditionally, the Han people had their own distinctive way of life, including the way they dressed. The type of clothing they wear is known as Hanfu, but some also call it Han clothing. The traditional clothing system of Han people is today divided into two phases: ancient and modern.Ancient Hanfu dates back to the time of Yellow Emperor, which is about 4,000 years ago. It had been developing until about 300 or 400 years ago, when the Qing Dynasty's policy on hair and dress code intervened.Later on, it was around the beginning of the 20th century when the country started moving more towards Western-style clothing. Moving forward, modern Hanfu styles refer to outfits that inherit the basic designs of Hanfu, along with more modern elements.These eight words sum up its characteristics and what makes a Hanfu. In Chinese, it says "Ping Zhong Jiao You, Kuan Tuan He Ying."Ping means flat. One of the key elements of Hanfu is that it doesn't have shoulder lines, meaning the outfit uses just one plain cut of fabric.Zhong means centralized. The cutting and tailoring abide by the rule of symmetrical tailoring and stitching.Jiao means the elements of Hanfu are designed to cross and overlap, upholding a belief in traditional Chinese culture: the balance of Yin and Yang.The word "You" is stressed, meaning everything must move to the right, including how the front is closed.The fifth one is Kuan, meaning width. Hanfu outfits have loose-fitting upper sleeves and bottom. It reminds the wearer to walk with grace and to observe etiquettes.Tuan and He refer to the edges and sleeves. The edges have to be neat and clean with no dangling threads, while the sleeves should come together and meet.Last, but not least is the embellishment.

The route not only linked Xinjiang to other areas of China, but also boosted the tourism and economic development in cities along the route.Read more: High-speed railway line speeds up Xinjiang development(With input from Xinhua)(Cover: A new bullet train to Xi'an sets off from Urumqi, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, October 11, 2020. /CFP)A new bullet train linking Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with the ancient city of Xi'an made its debut on Sunday, ending the history of no direct bullet train service between the two major northwestern Chinese cities, according to China Railway Xi'an Group Co., Ltd.With a top speed of 250 kilometers per hour, the newly launched bullet train reduces the travel time between the two cities to around 13 hours."The travel time from Urumqi to Xi'an has been reduced by more than 12 hours, in some case 21 hours at most, offering a new and convenient option for travelers," said Chen Jing, the vice director of the Ticket Management Office of the Urumqi Railway Bureau. The new train service will benefit the tourism sector and boost economic and cultural exchanges along the route, contributing to dynamism in economy and culture, as well as the opening-up of northwest China, said Zhang Baotong, head of Shaanxi Province Economic and Cultural Research.Over the years, China has launched several new high-speed railway routes in the northwestern part of the country in line with the new national train operation map to facilitate faster travel in the region. Xinjiang's first outbound high-speed railway route linking the region to Lanzhou City, capital of Gansu Province, was launched six years ago.

The elderly want to live at home. However, while their children are willing to take care of them, they suffer from lack of time and energy. Virtual nursing homes seem to be providing a solution to the problem.With just one phone call, the nursing home can provide various services for the elderly at home, from buying vegetables and cooking to cleaning, from massage services to accompanying the sick, so that the elderly can enjoy "personal customized elderly care" without leaving home. In the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, there is not a single bed, but it can serve tens of thousands of elderly people.An "information and home care service" platform and an "intelligent elderly care informatization" management platform have been created to incorporate registered elderly people, regardless of their location, according to Qin Tiantian, director of the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District. The system can provide professional and standardized home care services in a timely and accurate manner through big data collection."Although virtual nursing homes are virtual, the services are actually in place," said Qin. "As of now, more than 133,700 elderly people have been registered and hospitalized, and the total number of services has reached 13.79 million.""The combination of internet technology and elderly care services can not only update offline service maps, day care center monitoring and other content in real time, but also retrieve long-term monitoring data such as blood glucose and blood pressure of the elderly," said Liu Mingzhe, a technical engineer at the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District, adding that smart devices such as infrared sensors and voice-activated alarms can also realize "cloud monitoring" for the elderly in their virtual nursing homes."Different from traditional nursing homes, virtual nursing homes are an old-age care service platform built on information technology," said Pan Helin, professor at the Digital Economy Research Institute of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, further pointing out that virtual nursing homes are generally led by the government and integrate nursing institutions and communities."Elderly care resources such as medical service centers and housekeeping services provide various professional services for the elderly through remote diagnosis and treatment and home-based services," he added.The emergence of virtual nursing homes is a result of adapting to the country's social needs â a high degree of population aging and a stage of rapid development. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 2018, China's population of elderly people over 60 years old reached 249 million, accounting for 17.9 percent of the total population, and the pension situation is relatively severe."The comparative advantages of developing virtual nursing homes are very obvious. It can realize the centralized, precise and efficient supply of decentralized nursing resources, which is an effective choice for my country to deal with the impact of population aging," Pan said.Virtual nursing homes are not unexpected. As early as 2007, China's first virtual nursing home care service center was born in Gusu District, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. It mainly provides home-based care services for the elderly, especially empty nesters and the destitute. Today, after more than 10 years of development, Suzhou has formed a mature virtual pension model, which has been replicated and promoted throughout Jiangsu.In recent years, some places are also exploring different forms of virtual nursing homes. For example, Shanghai has vigorously developed an "embedded" elderly care system, creating a "15-minute home elderly care service circle" in urban areas, and launched new types of community elderly care institutions."Virtual nursing homes are all new things in the international arena, lacking mature experience reference, and relying more on our own exploration," Pan said."Current virtual nursing homes are also facing excessive reliance on government purchases, insufficient market activity, and shortage of talents. The bottleneck is that the construction of virtual nursing homes has a long way to go from one to many and from many to excellent," he added.Pan believes that it is necessary to improve relevant laws and regulations, standardize the development of the industry, strengthen the supervision of this new business format, and at the same time, under the principle of inclusiveness and prudence, enhance the tolerance of related enterprises and promote the development of the industry.Some other experts also mentioned that the key difference between virtual nursing homes and general housekeeping services lies in their professionalism and orientation. It is recommended to speed up the training of compound talents with skills in geriatrics, rehabilitation, nursing, psychology, and management, and expand the career development space of senior care service professionals.As the degree of population aging deepens, "virtual nursing homes" â a new model of home care that makes full use of social resources â are becoming the choice of more and more elderly people in China.The Chinese National Development and Reform Commission and 22 other departments jointly issued the "Implementation Opinions on Promoting Capacity Expansion and Quality Improvement of Consumption and Accelerating the Formation of a Strong Domestic Market" on March 13, 2020, proposing to vigorously develop the "internet + social services" consumption model and support the development of community-based virtual nursing homes.Over the past 10 years, virtual nursing homes have been promoted in many places in the country, exhibiting expanding service groups, diversified service content, and prominent intelligent features.

Domestic tourism revenue recovered 69.9 percent year on year.The reports released by several online travel platforms showed that the homestay inns were "difficult to book" during the holiday, and the popularity of the homestay industry even exceeded the same period last year.Judging from the occupancy trend, September 29 and 30 were the busiest days for homestay inns. Starting from the night of October 1, the occupancy rate showed explosive growth, and reached its peak on October 2 and lasted until October 6. The popularity of homestaysAccording to a report released by Tujia Homestay, China's short-term lodging rental platform, homestay bookings for this year's National Day Golden Week recovered to 95 percent from the same period last year. Among them, homestays in the countryside performed well, with platform booking volume reaching 120 percent from the same period last year.For example, the Huang He Su Ji hotel groups, a luxury homestay alliance comprised of five major domestic hotel operators, in Zhongwei, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, were fully occupied for the entire holiday."All the tourists who want to go abroad for holidays due to the COVID-19 pandemic have shifted to domestic, so high-end holiday products have been trending this year," said Ma Li, co-founder of Huang He Su Ji.Read more: Travelogue: Luxury hotel group helps transform desert into destination"The occupancy rate of Huang He Su Ji kept 100 percent from May to now, and visitors usually booked two months in advance almost, which is completely higher than the same period last year," added Ma.Qian Jiliang, president of Moganshan's homestay association, also told ThePaper that the average occupancy rate of homestays was about 90 percent during National Day last year, and more than 95 percent during this year's National Day, up five percentage points from the same period last year.Of course, there are occupancy rates that fell short of expectations.According to the ThePaper, the average occupancy rate at a homestay in Lijiang, a popular tourist destination, during National Day this year has been about 70 percent to 75 percent, according to an insider familiar with the Lijiang's homestay industry."The situation in Lijiang is much worse than last year," the person said. "I think it's still the overall impact of the epidemic. There were also uncertain orders before the festival, and many orders were returned," the insider added.

"We had expected to pay tribute to the booming 1920s in the film history and the birth of experimental film through the Pingyao International Film Festival after 100 years," said Jia Zhangke, Chinese film director and the festival's founder, recalling his last year's plan for this year's festival.But the plan was disrupted, as China's film industry was forced to shut down for 178 days due to the coronavirus pandemic. "As an international film festival held after the epidemic, we want to give a film's answer to the public health event," said Jia, "The festival is a manifestation that Chinese film industry workers insist on producing good works despite all odds and having dialogue with the world."That's how the theme of this year's festival, "Only Filmâ¦" comes. Just as it puts on the festival's official website, "Only films can make the darkness bright."Reduced size but high standard remainedAlthough with a reduced size, more than 50 films will be screened in the festival's five sections. Among them, 43 percent are for the world premiere, 89 percent for the Asian premiere, and all of them for the national premiere.The opening film "This is Life" is an anthology of a number of short videos, many of which are filmed by common people about their lives via their phones. The special presentation "So Far So Close," produced by Chinese director Zhang Yang, tells the story of a food deliveryman during the epidemic.The official selection section Crouching Tigers, which presents international directorial debuts or second features, includes "The Whale Boy," winner of the GdA Director's Award at the 17th edition of Venice's Giornate degli Autori, and "Residue," winner of the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Slamdance Film Festival.Section Hidden Dragons, focusing on Chinese emerging talents, has "An Insignificant Affair," winner of the White Mulberry Award for Best First-time Director at the 22nd Far East Film Festival.Presenting films by renowned directors or films in a spotlight, the section Galas includes the opening film of the 77th Venice Film Festival "The TiesLacci," and "The Women Who Ran" and "Hidden Away," which won the Silver Bear for Best Director and the Silver Bear for Best Actor respectively at the 70th Berlin Film Festival.Other sections collect nine films made in Shanxi, and nine films of the Serbian New Wave produced from the 1960s to 1970s in Yugoslavia's era.Since many international film festivals canceled this year, a section used to present the award-winning films of the year was cut off. Instead, more films produced by new talents have been added into Crouching Tigers and Hidden Dragons sections."Under the current situation, we hope to maintain the core competitiveness of the Pingyao International Film Festival, and promotes its core value in helping young directors to develop," said Jia.One thing to notice is that the over 1,000 film-making projects are seeking for promotion this year, twice than the number of the previous year. "It reflects that because of coronavirus, fewer films were filmed outdoor, but more screenplays and programs were written at home," said Jia.The festival, therefore, decided to increase the number of projects to be promoted. "Like other film festivals, the Pingyao International Film Festival experienced the puzzles brought by the pandemic, but we found our own solution," he said.The Pingyao International Film Festival encourages dialogue between non-Western (Chinese, Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, and African) and Western film communities, and fosters communication and collaboration between Chinese and international filmmakers.The 4th Pingyao International Film Festival kicks off in the ancient city of Pingyao, north China's Shanxi Province on Saturday, providing a non-Western film industry's answer to the world in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.This year marks the 125th anniversary of the birth of film.

She believes that the project will also contribute to "the important cultural and educational relationship between two countries."It is the largest ever digital festival of Chinese and UK creativity to have taken place through the British Council, according to Matt Burney, director of British Council China.The British international organization for education and culture partnered with the Department for International Trade of the UK and China's Chengdu Foreign Affairs Office to launch the online China-UK Contemporary Culture Festival, the first of its kind that is dedicated to cultural and creative exchanges between the countries.The festival celebrates the power of arts and culture in connecting people via introducing new artworks to wider audiences in China and the UK, aiming to help strengthen collaboration between artists and cultural institutions from the two countries as they are struggling to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Mughal noted that through the digital project #ConnectedByCreativity, they sought to overcome the challenges artists, institutions and audiences face in connecting to one another at times of social distancing and travel restrictions. "We wanted to ensure we were able to support connection and build trust despite not being in the same room," she added."Adversity can sometimes breed creativity. We felt it was important to mark this moment in history and to share art that has been produced during a pandemic," she said, adding that the online festival would help expand the reach of the art to new audiences from both countries.According to the Council, the event opened earlier on the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, with the main focus on promoting the works from Chinese artists and institutions in the UK.

And Jiangsu Province tops the list.This year's National Day holiday is the first golden week since China entered the epidemic prevention and control period. Domestic civil aviation, railway, automobile, and other transportation are all fully restored.According to data released by China's biggest online travel agency Ctrip, the peak travel season in China started one day before the Golden Week holiday. On October 1, China's railways carried 15.09 million passengers and civil aviation 1.67 million, both record highs for a single day since the outbreak began.On Ctrip, all kinds of travel modes, including flights, trains, buses and rentals cars, have achieved overall growth. Among them, the number of air tickets increased by more than 100 percent month on month in September, the number of train tickets increased by more than 300 percent month on month, and the number of bus tickets increased by more than 200 percent month on month.Residents in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen traveled the most, while Sanya, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Xi'an,  Kunming, Nanjing ranked top as popular destinations.Among all Ctrip users during the holiday, the ratio of male to female was 52:48. But what is more noteworthy is that the post-90s, post-00s accounted for more than 60 percent of travelers.Twenty-five provinces in China revealed its tourism revenue over the eight-day National Day holiday, 15 of which exceeded 10 billion yuan according to officials.

From all-round scandals to plot-twists, this is an almost unscripted real-life TV show. And this year, drama is being served daily.Train-wreck debates, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the following nomination debacle, President Trump getting, unsurprisingly, infected with COVID-19, and news of his $750 taxes are just examples of how these elections can be tragically juicy. Still, if you have time, disposition, and are curious about the world of American politics and some of the issues that are central in this year's cycle, we leave you some suggestions for the weekend.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionThe Circus: Inside the craziest political campaign on earthThis Showtime series with five seasons is a must. Starting in 2016 with the Primaries and following election, the show is running until today, giving an extraordinary account of the campaign and political world in the U.S. Featuring exclusive interviews and analyses by the show hosts, strategist Mark Mckinnon, and reporters John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, it gives an inside look to the candidates through candid interviews, backstage shots and them following the campaign trail.At the beginning of the show, the crew was following Republican candidate Jeb Bush, brother of former President George W. Bush, when he gets a call asking if he would support Donald Trump if he was the nominee to the White House. Bush's reaction was exactly the same as everyone else in the world, "that's not going to happen." Fate proved us all wrong. Since season 3, the show counts with Alex Wagner, an anchor and correspondent at CBS News, since Mark Halperin left. With episodes being released every week, it is a good way to keep track of what's going on.The Comey Rule   Another Showtime jewel, The Comey Rule was written and directed by Billy Ray, based on the former FBI Director James Comey's book "A Higher Loyalty."Starring Jeff Daniels, from the magnificent "Newsroom," as Comey and Brendan Gleeson as a scary Trump, the two-part event series starts with the investigation into Clinton's emails, their impact on the election, followed by the first months of the Trump presidency, when Comey is fired.Daniels portrays a naÃ¯ve honor-bound Comey. "[Comey] thinks that being right will save him. It won't," said an FBI agent.In the first episode, two Russian agents come on screen, commenting on testing a Twitter article with fake information against Secretary Clinton that reached 300,000 likes. The scene is frightening for feeling so real in today's social media environment.The second part begins with the dread of Trump's victory and possible outcomes.Gleeson's Trump is a solemn representation of the president. His speech and mannerisms are on point and additionally grim. When he says, "it's a terrible thing," an expression that is so Trump-like, it sounds daunting. Their exchanges on screen are always tense and on the verge of intimidation.Like the Washington Post said, watching this show is like "replaying a nightmare while we're still having it."Agent of ChaosAlex Gibney directs HBO's "Agent of Chaos," a two-part documentary focused on alleged Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.In an interview with The Guardian, Gibney explained how the Russian government or business interests tried to sow chaos in the U.S. with disinformation campaigns led by "troll factories" that created divisive campaigns in social media, cyber-attacks, infiltration into state election systems; and supporting the Trump campaign.It's a documentary on how chaos can be weaponized "to amass power."In the episode focusing on Trump and Putin, Gibney noted, "It's all about greed, and avarice, and corruption. The agents of chaos in both countries had common interests."Read more: October surprise: Last-minute plot twists that decided U.S. presidentsKnock Down the House Directed by Rachel Lears, this 2019 Netflix documentary might not seem appropriate for now because is focused on the 2018 mid-terms. But the fact that it is centered around four women running for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, Joe Crowley, and Paula Jean Swearengin, makes it significant.This year, for the first time in the U.S. political history, six women ran for President, and one was nominated for Vice-President â Kamala Harris. Now, more than ever, women are partaking in civic life by running for office and donating. Ocasio-Cortez takes center stage as the cameras follow her "run to win" from the bar where she worked to the Capitol, where she remembers a trip with her father to the same place. "I think I finally did it [make him proud]."Immigration NationSeparation of families, the border wall, and other controversial immigration policies and statements also defined President Trump's tenure, and that is why it is on this list. Even if the topic has been gone from the presidential and VP debates and part of the public discussion.Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz were allowed to accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents for over two years, but when the six-part documentary was about to come out, ICE threatened to block the release of some scenes.Only for this, the show must be watched. Secondly, it is easy to understand why the police would want to erase some footage: detention quotas, "collaterals" being detained because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time not because they committed a crime, and agents saying repeatedly they are "only doing their jobs." This sentence crystallizes their attempts to rationalize pain and suffering, perpetuating a system of terror. The Netflix docuseries includes heart-wrenching testimonials of fathers separated from their children, crying on camera wondering where they are, as the first episode carries the weight of their grief, desolation, anguish. And also the story, perhaps unknown to most, of U.S. army veterans that are deported, after all, it mirrors how being allowed to die for the country doesn't equal the right to live in it.(Cover photo: The Circus official poster.)If there is something that U.S. politics thrives in, it is drama.

Our admissions practices are completely fair and lawful. Yale's admissions policies will not change as a result of the filing of this baseless lawsuit. We look forward to defending these policies in court," Yale President Peter Salovey wrote in a statement to campus Thursday evening, the Wall Street Journal reported.In addition, Salovey countered that the DOJ's allegations are based on inaccurate statistics and unwarranted conclusions."DOJ's claim that the proportion of various racial groups admitted to Yale has remained stable for many years. In fact, in the last two decades, the percentage of admitted applicants fluctuated significantly for all groups," said Salovey.The Washington Post reported that a U.S. higher education association called the Justice Department's lawsuit "shocking and disheartening" and accused it of being politically motivated to bring it 26 days before the U.S. presidential election.The issue of race in college admissions in the U.S. has long been controversial, the report said.

But the public's wrath, fear, and grief are subsiding as this becomes just another case relegated to the annals of domestic violence.A farmer living on picking herbs in remote mountains in northwestern Sichuan Province, Lamu enjoyed sharing everyday life with her nearly 900,000 fans on the popular short video app Douyin. She regularly posted videos of working in the field, cooking for her family and dancing to Tibetan melodies. On camera, she was a happy-go-lucky woman fighting for a better life for her father and two children. But all of that abruptly ended when her former husband, surnamed Tang, broke into her home during one of her livestreaming sessions. Tang doused her in gasoline and then set her alight, burning 90 percent of her body, in addition to stabbing her multiple times. She died on September 30 after 16 days of medical treatment.Lamu's death sparked an outcry among netizens throughout the country as they demanded justice for her. Within a few days, hashtags mentioning her name received more than 420 million views. Nevertheless, the attention has been short-lived in this frenzied era of social media. People are outraged when such atrocities highlighting gender inequality continue to happen, but they soon forget, until the next "Lamu" appears.What went wrong? It seems that people unconsciously understand that such horrendous cases will inevitably happen again and again, and grow accustomed to these whopping numbers: More than 90 million married women in China regularly face domestic violence. Some 157,000 Chinese women commit suicide every year on average, making it one of the few countries where the female suicide rate is higher than it is for males, and among them 60 percent kill themselves because of domestic violence. On average the victims don't call the police until they've been abused at least 35 times."Violence will become the solution where law, morality and negotiation are all out of control," said Wang Fengli, a Beijing-based sociologist who studies domestic violence, during an interview with CGTN.China is a latecomer to having a legal interpretation of family violence. It wasn't until 2001 that physical abuse could be considered a reason to file for divorce. Only in 2016 did China's first anti-domestic violence law come into effect. It helps victims of physical or mental abuse in the family through various means such as restraining orders.But it "has loopholes," said Peng Chun, assistant professor of Peking University Law School. "It covers married couples, cohabitating partners, and other family members, but it does not deal with violence against former spouses or intimate partners who do not live together." As seen in Lamu's case, she was no longer eligible for a protection order because she was divorced, even though she'd been abused and threatened by Tang for a decade.Late last year, He Yuhong, a Chongqing-based beauty blogger who goes by the name Yuyamika, posted a video including surveillance footage that shows her ex-boyfriend violently dragging her from an elevator despite her struggling and yelling for help. "For the past six months, I seem to have been living in a nightmare," she wrote.The challenge in defining what constitutes domestic violence as well as the difficulty in gathering such evidence usually lead to delays in or rejections of issuing personal safety protection orders, according to Peng. In 2019, over 2,000 such orders were granted, triple that in 2016, but that was a far cry considering the hundreds of thousands of victims every year. Plus, the law fails to address sexual abuse or economic control.The gaps in the law and its enforcement aren't the only factors discouraging the abused from seeking justice. There is a deep-rooted mentality best encapsulated by an old Chinese saying, "Even upright officials cannot adjudicate family affairs." Due to this distinction, some police and judges would take family violence a private matter that should be dealt with by the family themselves."Thousands of years of patriarchy means that males are responsible for the fate of a household," said Wang. "In conservative or patriarchal societies, the rates of family violence are higher."This notion of tribal justice extends to cases such as Lamu's, where police only take the matter seriously when it ends in tragedy. Reports say that Lamu went to local police for help multiple times since last year in attempts to get a divorce. The authorities ended up giving Tang verbal warnings instead.Statistics from the All-China Women's Federation show that 80 percent of women calling the police for domestic violence are ignored because they are considered "family affairs" instead of criminal activity. Some of these women were even reprimanded by the police.The more difficult fight, however, lies in changing prejudices against those suffering from domestic violence. Even though Lamu was the victim, a few netizens on Weibo said that she must have done something wrong in her marriage to deserve being beaten, or that she shouldn't have attracted such attention by becoming an Internet celebrity/sensation. Those with this mentality essentially criticize the female victim for displaying too much agency or not living up to certain standards, while diminishing the male aggressor's responsibility.Wang thinks the psychology of victim-blaming is the biggest obstacle in the fight against domestic violence. Lamu is a "perfect victim" in many ways â an independent woman who struggled to divorce twice and supported her family on her own. She was fighting against her ex-husband, his violence and her fate, but she couldn't survive.Tang reportedly beat her not just at home, but overtly in the street. Lukewarm reactions from authorities in that small village ingrained with chauvinistic attitudes only hastened the onset of tragedy.But that can't explain it all. In relatively progressive societies, tragedies still happen. Hong Mei, a 40-year-old journalist who was in particular covering domestic violence in Ordos in Inner Mongolia, suffered violent beatings from her husband for over a decade before she died from abuse in 2016.It's not all gloom and doom. "The number of protection orders issued nationwide is on the rise, which shows that family violence victims are taking the initiative to protect themselves," Feng Yuan, co-founder of Equality, a Beijing-based NGO, told CGTN. In 2016, courts throughout China granted only 687 such orders; the figure rose to 2,004 in 2019.Meanwhile, the supreme court issued guidelines for local courts to reduce the burden of proof on plaintiffs, in consideration of the difficulty in acquiring the substantial evidence of abuse needed to apply for restraining orders.Lamu's tragic ending is part of a story that has been told again and again, as part of a cycle of complicity in which society chooses to ignore and forget simply because it's the easy thing to do. Attitudes toward domestic violence can only change when the public decides that one more incident of abuse is too many.Even now, users on social media lament that Lamu could have escaped death if she hadn't gone down from the mountains. But a world where Lamu could have lived her life without fear wherever she could have chosen to be is a world that we should strive for.(China 24, Zeng Ziyi and Yu Jing contributed reporting.)If you have a story on family violence and want to share it with us, please write to stories@cgtn.com.Also, if you or someone you know is suffering from domestic violence, please call this hotline (China only): 15117905157.It's been barely a week since Lamu, a 30-year-old woman from southwest China, died after being set on fire by her ex-husband.

local media reported Thursday. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, the 11 countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than three months also being eligible.Eligible travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 before entering Japan and upon arrival in Japan, while their sponsors, such as companies or organizations which support them, will be expected to ensure their self-isolation for 14 days, during which time they will not be allowed to use public transport.The government had said it would consider permitting 1,000 foreigners into the country per day, mainly to accommodate those who intend to stay for three months or longer, while looking to increasing the cap in the months ahead.Foreigners with resident status here who had been overseas have recently been allowed to re-enter the county, while expatriates and other long-term residents from some Asian countries have also been granted access into the country.These include those from Vietnam, Thailand and a number of other economies with which reciprocal agreements have been made.The Japanese government has more recently made similar reciprocal agreements with Singapore and Brunei.Currently, people from 159 countries and regions have been denied entry to the country, but Japan has steadily been easing its entry restrictions. (Cover: Japan.

for the younger generation, the Strawberry Music Festival (Strawberry), by the independent music label and organizer Modernsky, came back to Beijing on October 5 during the country's Golden Week holiday. It was delayed due to a COVID-19 pandemic that shattered the whole country earlier this year. As the first mega party in the city since, attendees and organizers have pulled out all the stops for the festival. Although the epidemic situation has been significantly improved in China, the festival still took place with strict anti-coronavirus measures: Masks were required throughout the show, body temperature scans were performed at the entrance, disinfection of the venue was carried out throughout the day, etc. As the biggest domestic music festival in China, Modernsky made sure they would not scrimp on talent. The three-day line up featured Chinese singers and bands that have become the focus of attention in recent years: New Pants, Jike Junyi, Vinida, and many others.Miumiu, the six-year-old girl who touched hearts of netizens worldwide with her angelic voice and amazing instrumental skills, was among the artists invited this year.

She said she now cherishes returning to normalcy and has a different outlook about going to music festivals. "Something that I used to take for granted has suddenly become so precious," Deng said.The pandemic also caused a lot of challenges in the hosting of the event.

The designers apply not only the 24 solar terms but also the 72 pentads of the Chinese phenology, which started from Han Dynasty some 2,000 years ago. "The 24 solar terms were inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2016. But the 72 pentads are not known to most people. To us, the 24 solar terms are too broad because the plants change every 5 to 7 days. With the 72 pentads we're able to fix the botanical materials to suit varied needs," said Zhao Sumin, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Gardenscape.Zhao's company grows around 1,500 different kinds of plants. Most of them are imported from the United States. In the past 18 years, she and her workmates have provided services to private and public spaces. However, her biggest wish is to revive the biodiversity in northern China. "I went to Minnesota, the United States in 1991 as a visiting scholar. I found that the private gardens and the whole city were rich in types and colors even in fall and winter. Four years later I started to introduce the greenhouse technology to China and then the work of industrial seedling raising. I realized what China needed the most was to import more colors of the nature, or let's say biodiversity. This is a long-term plan," Zhao said.Her company was designated as the national forestry germplasm source bank in 2006, the only one in Beijing and the only private enterprise of its kind in China. The State Forestry Administration experts were deeply impressed by the more than 110 kinds of Chinese flowering crabapple trees in the garden. "The crabapple trees were from China originally. They were found in a very wide range of areas from Hebei to Yunnan provinces. In the past two to three centuries, they were brought abroad and now there are over 600 kinds of them in the American archive. I chose the types which fruits don't fall in winter so the clients are able to enjoy the flowers in early spring, red and yellow leaves in fall and fruits when it snows. Also birds can eat the fruits in winter," Zhao said.Chinese people's longing for a better environment has been growing strongly in recent years. Gardening is widely applied in urban landscape, parks, expos. companies and houses. Zhao said her biggest wish is that people can go out and embrace nature. And more importantly, respect nature. "Gardening has become a part of Chinese people's lives. We have been working on combining the imported plants with local wild ones. We hope that people can know more about plants and respect them. Our gardens are opened to botanists, designers, families and schools from time to time. Nature has been nurturing humans and we should cherish its contribution and build a healthier ecosystem," she said.Through the sophisticated designs by botanists, Chinese urban dwellers are now able to escape their bustling day-to-day lives, and find some inner peace while at it. At the just concluded Beijing Design Expo, one of the major offline events of the Beijing Design Week, this tiny garden attracted much attention. The stall is just a very small part of the business of the Beijing-based botanical company and seed bank. In its 9 gardens in the outskirts of the city, visitors are able to experience vibrant colors any day of the year. The designers apply not only the 24 solar terms but also the 72 pentads of the Chinese phenology, which started from Han Dynasty some 2,000 years ago. "The 24 solar terms were inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2016. But the 72 pentads are not known to most people. To us, the 24 solar terms are too broad because the plants change every 5 to 7 days. With the 72 pentads we're able to fix the botanical materials to suit varied needs," said Zhao Sumin, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Gardenscape.Zhao's company grows around 1,500 different kinds of plants. Most of them are imported from the United States. In the past 18 years, she and her workmates have provided services to private and public spaces. However, her biggest wish is to revive the biodiversity in northern China. "I went to Minnesota, the United States in 1991 as a visiting scholar. I found that the private gardens and the whole city were rich in types and colors even in fall and winter. Four years later I started to introduce the greenhouse technology to China and then the work of industrial seedling raising. I realized what China needed the most was to import more colors of the nature, or let's say biodiversity. This is a long-term plan," Zhao said.Her company was designated as the national forestry germplasm source bank in 2006, the only one in Beijing and the only private enterprise of its kind in China. The State Forestry Administration experts were deeply impressed by the more than 110 kinds of Chinese flowering crabapple trees in the garden. "The crabapple trees were from China originally. They were found in a very wide range of areas from Hebei to Yunnan provinces. In the past two to three centuries, they were brought abroad and now there are over 600 kinds of them in the American archive. I chose the types which fruits don't fall in winter so the clients are able to enjoy the flowers in early spring, red and yellow leaves in fall and fruits when it snows. Also birds can eat the fruits in winter," Zhao said.Chinese people's longing for a better environment has been growing strongly in recent years.

In 2019, 98.4 percent of the primary and secondary schools had internet access, and 90.1 percent had multimedia classrooms."The educational pattern has changed since the pandemic occurred, but the basic framework of basic education will not change just due to such an emergency," said Yu Minhong, founder of Chinese educational institute "New Oriental," adding that teachers had started using online education as a tool to better help students before COVID-19 with both formats merging together in the future."Online education will not replace offline education," he added.Online education appeared in the 1990s when homes in China began connecting to the internet. But, its scope and reach remained limited, and it only supplemented education in classrooms. With technological advances and greater penetration of internet in China, the use of online education picked up after 2010.Yu also noted that thanks to 5G technology, online education will become more accessible to students in rural or mountainous areas, giving them a chance to increase their knowledge and sign up for new courses.As of May 11, a national online learning platform for primary and secondary school students has received over 2 billion views.(With input from agencies)The convergence of online and offline education will take over China's educational development in a post COVID-19 world, according to a fresh report on China's internet development.A total of 282 million Chinese students have turned to online courses in the first half of this year, according to the report issued by the China Internet Network Information Center.Data from the report shows that during the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of daily active users on online education platforms increased from 87 million to 127 million after the Spring Festival, up by 46 percent.This year's popularization of online education builds on an already existing tech infrastructure at schools, the report said.

In the village, over 80 percent of households make papers at home using the original method that dates back over 1,800 years. Historically, Chinese people have been using various plants, such as hemp and bamboo, for making paper. The villagers use barks of paper mulberry as raw material. The trees, commonly seen on the roadsides, can grow fast and have been used to make paper from the early second century. Ai Kannan, who used to be a monk at a Buddhist temple, showed us the process of making paper.

Sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy in 2017 and forced it to postpone the 2018 prize â a first in 70 years.Two laureates were named last year with the 2018 award going to Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian novelist Peter Handke honored as the 2019 Nobel laureate. Handke's prize unleashed a flood of criticism as the writer is known for supporting Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in the Balkan wars.Gluck would have received the accolade from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.The in-person ceremony, however, has been canceled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It's the first exhibition to open in the British capital since the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lockdown to the UK's public spaces, including art galleries and museums.Getting Nauman's installations in place has taken seven weeks â an unusually long time to set up an exhibition, due to new measures to limit the number of people in the space at any one time. But for curator and former director of Tate Nicholas Serota, the wait was worth it."We've had to take every possible precaution. And, of course, the visitors, when they arrive, will be given every possible safeguard. But it's the most exciting moment to have a new show by a great artist in one of the great museums of the world," Serota said.Nauman's work spans more than 50 years and some themes reoccur over time, such as the human body, lettering and language, and physical and psychological pressure. In a career that defies easy categorization, he has experimented with neons, video installations, sculpture and more.In addition, some works have taken on new meaning in this era of COVID-19. The piece "Hands Washing Normal," for instance, shows someone washing hands vigorously with a lot of soap."This is a piece that was not made this year. It was made in 1996. So Nauman takes these rituals that we all perform and makes us look at them even more carefully. And whatever resonance that piece had in 1996, it certainly has a very different resonance in 2020," said Serota.Nauman may not be as famous as Andy Warhol or Yayoi Kusama, but his impact on the art scene is undeniable. His exploration of the dull, everyday life is what makes this exhibition special, according to art critic for Londonist Tabish Khan."When you first go in, it's slightly strange because you think art is meant to be beautiful or is meant to be inspiring. But here we are celebrating the mundane, the inane, sometimes the slightly awkward, confusing or even disturbing," Khan said."We like to celebrate the moments that are great, but at the same time, it's also filled by moments where nothing actually happens," he added.The exhibition runs until February 21, 2021.(With input from AP)Tate Modern, a modern art gallery in London, launched a new exhibition on Wednesday, displaying a variety of works by American conceptual artist Bruce Nauman.

Previously, the film was shortlisted at the Cannes Film Festival in 2020 as one of only two finalists among Chinese-language films.The film centers on China's post-90s generation by telling the story of a restless young man named Kun. As he's about to graduate from college, he drops out of the film school and embarks on a journey "marked by restlessness and absurdity, calamity and joy" as introduced on BFI's official website.Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen's "Mangrove" was selected as the opening film to raise the curtain of the festival. It tells the trial of the Mangrove Nine â a group of black activists accused of inciting a riot at a protest â in the 1970s.

She was told by her teacher of a special opportunity to work with helicopters. The project was recruiting students from poor families in Tibet, and she was lucky to be selected as one of them."At the beginning, I was excited and I couldn't believe it," she said.From February 2017, she started her training and learned to operate and maintain helicopters in Jiangsu. Then in March 2018, she graduated, becoming one of the 28 Tibetans who succeeded in being among the first Tibetan pilots to obtain a license.Back in Lhasa, she is now a civil helicopter pilot with the Lhasa Snow Eagle General Aviation. She'll carry tourists and show them around the city of Lhasa, introducing some of its attractions, customs and history. She said it's quite different to see the landmark Potala Palace up in the air than seeing it from the ground."I feel a sense of accomplishment when I take tourists to see Lhasa from the air," she told CGTN.With a pair of aviator sunglasses and a pilot uniform, Janre Yeshi is ready to board the helicopter and show tourists what the city of Lhasa looks like from above.Born and raised in an impoverished family in Lhasa's Dangxiong County, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, the 23-year-old Tibetan girl never imagined that her life could encounter such tremendous transformation.Back in 2016, a poverty alleviation project launched together by the local government and the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu utterly changed her life path.It was around the time of the national college entrance examination when students from across the country were busy preparing for the exam.

The project was recruiting students from poor families in Tibet, and she was lucky to be selected as one of them."At the beginning, I was excited and I couldn't believe it," she said.From February 2017, she started her training and learned to operate and maintain helicopters in Jiangsu. Then in March 2018, she graduated, becoming one of the 28 Tibetans who succeeded in being among the first Tibetan pilots to obtain a license.Back in Lhasa, she is now a civil helicopter pilot with the Lhasa Snow Eagle General Aviation. She'll carry tourists and show them around the city of Lhasa, introducing some of its attractions, customs and history. She said it's quite different to see the landmark Potala Palace up in the air than seeing it from the ground."I feel a sense of accomplishment when I take tourists to see Lhasa from the air," she told CGTN.The Guardian Art Center in Beijing is holding an exhibition to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Art Nova 100, which nominates about 100 artists from across China each year. A total of 500 works from those young artists are on display, covering a wide range of art forms, including oil painting, traditional Chinese painting, sculpture, installation, video and multimedia. With the theme "IN/OUT," the exhibition is divided into three sections: "fluid society," "natural simulation," and "the deduction of civilization." Through their artworks, young artists express their understanding of nature and their reflection on technology and society. In a multimedia work named "Gaze into Haze," people are able to see multi-layered information like the silhouette of visitors, English words, LEGO and fish in the background, yet none of them can be seen clearly. The artist wants to mirror the information explosion that we are currently experiencing. Another work shows a phone number and there is actually a cell phone hidden inside the installation. When people call the number, it makes disturbing noises."It's difficult for us to stay quiet nowadays. Even if you want peace and quiet, you are easily affected by others. So this work reflects our situation in a plain way," says the creator AIWU.Launched in 2011, Art Nova 100 is an art platform that discovers and promotes young artists. Each year, thousands of young artists in China apply for the program, and around 100 are selected after evaluation from experts.Those artists on the final shortlist are invited to participate in Art Nova 100, which includes exhibitions and forums both in China and abroad, as well as a multi-channel artist promotion program. "Over 100 young artists started their career from this platform. Before we started, many art students would either give up on becoming artists after graduation or stay unknown to the public in small studios," Peng Wei, director of Art Nova 100, said."But I feel proud that in the past nine years since the platform was launched, it has helped many young artists follow their dreams," she added.The Guardian Art Center in Beijing is holding an exhibition to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Art Nova 100, which nominates about 100 artists from across China each year.

It took only 3 years to build, and first went into operation 6 years ago.Chen Xin felt curious and excited when he first boarded a bullet train 6 years ago. He still remembers the day he got into a bullet train cab for the first time. He wasn't allowed to touch the control desk because his teacher was afraid that he might do something wrong and force the train to stop. Now he's become one of the best bullet train drivers in Xinjiang.Before 2011, Chen drove either diesel or electric locomotives. But he says driving bullet trains is very different, and much better."Diesel and electric locomotives don't seal properly. Sand still gets inside, even when the windows are closed," Chen said. He had to clean up the sand or it could have damaged the control desk and other devices in the cabin."Now bullet trains are wind and sand proof. So I can focus on my work, safely taking passengers to their destinations," he added.Xinjiang's first high-speed rail line officially opened in November 2014, connecting the region's capital city Urumqi with Hami, a city in east Xinjiang. The 530-kilometer trip used to take 4-6 hours. Today, it takes only 2.5 hours. Traveling by bullet train has now become a new way of life for the locals.Despite the transformation that high-speed railway has brought to the city, for Chen, one thing hasn't changed. That is the sense of responsibility."No matter what kind of locomotives you're driving, you should stick to your sense of responsibility. You should be responsible for yourself, your passengers, as well as the state property," he told CGTN.Chen has witnessed the railway's development in Xinjiang, from diesel locomotives to electric, and now bullet trains. What impressed him the most are the greater levels of efficiency as well as the working environment.The speed limit for trains in Xinjiang is now two times higher than before and Chen believes it'll be three times faster in the foreseeable future.The bullet train is changing people's way of life in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and boosting the region's economic potential.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

This year's Beijing Design Week launched a special section to promote the application of cultural IP. CGTN went to a newly established platform to see how they are trying to revive classical IP and help young designers.At a cafe by the Forbidden City, visitors can enjoy a moment within a space decorated with the well-known "One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" by Wang Ximeng, and have a taste of royal flavor from the Palace Museum, such as "Kangxi Likes Chocolates." And as a model combining modern design and the traditional culture, Si Shi Ying Wu presents the cooperation between inheritors of intangible cultural heritage and designers.All the paintings on the wall were downloaded from a platform called Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Design."Under the CC0 license, a list of famous museums, including the British Museum, has opened their digital materials to the public for free. This is a great leap in the history of human civilization," Zhao Dongbao, co-founder of CC0 Design, told CGTN."It's a pity that only a few Chinese cultural institutions are cooperating with these international organizations. We are doing this to get more people to know about this and make full use of it," he added.The platform has stored a large amount of content and is continuing to expand its capacity. Users can search and download for free, and the platform also encourages young designers to create their own works based on these materials. It is the first of its kind to develop products based on CC0 license."The CC0 license has mobilized more designers to create their own works based on high-definition digital material," Yu Fei, co-founder of CC0 Design, also Assistant President of Sinofaith Group said. "Since then, a lot of amazing artworks have been produced, which are dynamic and popular and somehow extend the life cycle of museum collections. For some time, we've been discussing how to breathe new life into cultural relics. They shouldn't be kept asleep in museums. We need to let more people learn about them and enjoy them. We hope our designers can find these materials easily, and those precious masterpieces will give them great inspiration," Yu said.It's a hope which resonates with young designers. Chen Hui, a product designer said, "It's difficult for us designers to find materials. We have to search a bunch of websites. This website collects all these materials. It is a user-friendly platform and all of these are free."So far, over 10 museums in the world have adopted the CC0 license.

He was 65.A person close to Van Halenâs family confirmed the rocker died Tuesday due to cancer. The person was not authorized to publicly release details in advance of an official announcement."I can't believe I'm having to write this, but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning," Wolf Van Halen wrote in a message on Twitter with a picture of the rocker who was 65."He was the best father I could ever ask for," he added. "Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift."My heart is broken and I don't think I'll ever fully recover from this loss. I love you so much, Pop." Born in the Netherlands and raised in California, Van Halen founded the rock group with his older brother Alex in the early 1970s and quickly earned a fan base.He was famous for what became known as "finger tapping" â playing the guitar with two hands, like a piano.He was also known for his guitars, including one named Frankenstein which he pieced together from part of other instruments.Among the group's classics are "Jump," "Panama," "Runnin' with the Devil," and the guitar solo "Eruption.""Ed's a once- or twice-in-a-century kind of guy. There's Hendrix and there's Eddie Van Halen," friend and guitarist Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains said during Grammy weekend in January 2019. "Those two guys tilted the world on its axis."Van Halen has sold more than 75 million albums and has more number one hits on the mainstream U.S. rock chart than any other artist, according to the band's label. The group's album "1984" was to be the band's high point, giving them their only number one single "Jump."The creative tension within the band boiled over during the "1984" tour, with Eddie Van Halen and original frontman David Lee Roth falling out. Roth left the band in April 1985.One of his gripes with Eddie Van Halen was reportedly the rocker's outside work that included providing the lead-in guitar for Michael Jackson's 1983 smash hit "Beat It." However, Van Halen announced a reunion tour in 2007 with Roth performing with the group for the first time in 22 years.Another tour planned in 2012 had to be cancelled after Eddie Van Halen had to undergo emergency surgery.But the band reunited again in 2015 for an extensive North American tour.Eddie Van Halen was known to have health problems that would interfere with his work for years.He underwent hip surgery in 1999 and had part of his tongue removed in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer, likely because of heavy smoking.Although he was declared cancer free following the surgery, the American tabloid news site TMZ reported earlier this year that he had been going to Germany for throat cancer treatment. His drug abuse and heavy drinking contributed to his 2007 divorce from TV actress Valerie Bertinelli after 16 years of marriage."I was an alcoholic, and I needed alcohol to function," he said in a 2015 interview with Billboard magazine. "I didn't drink to party. Alcohol and cocaine were private things to me. I would use them for work. The blow keeps you awake and the alcohol lowers your inhibitions. I'm sure there were musical things I would not have attempted were I not in that mental state."Tributes from some of the biggest names in the music world poured in Tuesday following news of his death."I'm just devastated to hear the news of the passing of my dear friend Eddie Van Halen. He fought a long and hard battle with his cancer right to the very end. Eddie was one of a very special kind of person, a really great friend. Rest In Peace my dear friend till we meet again," Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi tweeted."Sad to hear Eddie Van Halen has passed away. A guitar innovator with a fierce spirit of musical and technical exploration. Prayers and thoughts with his family and friends," Yusuf/Cat Stevens tweeted.Songwriter Diane Warren said in a tweet that "guitars are gently weeping everywhere.

Alcohol and cocaine were private things to me. I would use them for work. The blow keeps you awake and the alcohol lowers your inhibitions. I'm sure there were musical things I would not have attempted were I not in that mental state."Tributes from some of the biggest names in the music world poured in Tuesday following news of his death."I'm just devastated to hear the news of the passing of my dear friend Eddie Van Halen. He fought a long and hard battle with his cancer right to the very end. Eddie was one of a very special kind of person, a really great friend. Rest In Peace my dear friend till we meet again," Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi tweeted."Sad to hear Eddie Van Halen has passed away. A guitar innovator with a fierce spirit of musical and technical exploration. Prayers and thoughts with his family and friends," Yusuf/Cat Stevens tweeted.Songwriter Diane Warren said in a tweet that "guitars are gently weeping everywhere. Shred In Power Eddie Van Halen."The rocker is survived by his second wife Janie Liszewski and his son, as well as his first wife Bertinelli.Theyâre one of the hottest boy bands in the world, South Koreaâs BTS.And everyone wants a part of them, or as close to it as they can get.Retail investors in South Korea snapped up shares of Big Hit Entertainment, the music label behind BTS, to the tune of $50 billion during the two-day subscription as part of its initial public offering.That was more than 600 times the value of shares on offer to retail investors, meaning that many would-be shareholders will receive only a fraction of their requests.Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

And, it symbolizes China's highest authority.  As one of many structures built to mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, its design and construction draw wide attention.  In 1954, the first National People's Congress was held, but only  about 1,200 deputies attended the conference due to the small meeting venue. Building a larger meeting place seemed an urgent task. Soon after, CPC Chairman Mao Zedong came up with the idea of building an auditorium for 10,000 people. "The Great Hall of the People was a great breakthrough at that time in terms of scale," said Mi Junren, vice chief architect of the Institute of Architecture and Environmental Art Design. "It was not an easy job to build a structure with a floor area of 170,000 square meters. Another important highlight is the halls inside, such as the grand auditorium, which can hold 10,000 people. There isn't another auditorium as big in the world today. The Great Hall of the People embodies the highest technical level of architecture, acoustics, lighting, and sound." In 1958 and 1959, designers and construction workers from across the nation came to Beijing to work on the project. They were faced with many challenges, including the interior ceiling design of the Grand Auditorium. At last, the proposal given by then premier, Zhou Enlai was adopted. He raised the concept of "Water and sky merge in one color.""The most wonderful design of the auditorium is the ceiling," said Mi. "We can see elements like the pentacle stars, sunflowers, and water ripples. The roof of the building is more than 30 meters above the ground, and if the walls and roof form a right angle, then the roof will appear very small. Premier Zhou Enlai suggested that the roof and walls be integrated to form a cambered surface. With lights turned on, people feel like they're sitting under a vast starry sky."  The columns at the east gate of the building were also a challenge. After construction was completed, then Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen decided that the span between the middle two columns should be larger than the rest, according to Chinese architectural tradition. He insisted on the removal of the 23-meter-high concrete pillars. "The central concrete structure was irremovable, so workers tried to remove the decorative surface to the side. After removing the outer surface, the distance between the middle columns became larger than the rest," Mi said.Construction of The Great Hall of the People was completed in September 1959, right before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.  Although six decades have passed, the building continues to look powerful and solemn on the west side of Tian'anmen Square.  (Cover image: The Great Hall of the People. /VCG)The Great Hall of the People, where major national affairs are discussed and decided, is an architectural treasure on Beijing's Tian'anmen Square.

It's 200 kilometers from the Taklamakan Desert. On this day, CGTN met the archaeological team of the site, the oldest ever excavated in Xinjiang.The rammed construction with barbican entrances is called the Ruins of Luntai City, as well as Kuiyuq Shehayer ancient city, which means "city in ashes." It is there CGTN met Dang Zhihao from the Xinjiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology and the project manager of the city ruins. He's been doing archeological work for decades; this is his second project.The archeologists started working there three-and-a-half years ago. They have since uncovered substantial evidence that this ancient site could be traced as far back as 2,500 years, to as early as 500 BC during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BC)."That is to say, at least starting between the Han Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn era, on the northern rim of Tarim Basin, here stands such a city. It shocked us," said Dang.The site's geographic proximity to the Taklamakan Desert has proven to be an enormous challenge for the archeological team in unfolding this mysterious site as the sand blows relentlessly, covering almost everything in dry dust."Compared with central China, the environment in Xinjiang for archaeological investigation is harsh, which makes our work more difficult. But the charm of our work is constantly updating knowledge about the world with new findings. This allows more people to learn about Xinjiang's history, and love the land more," Dang said.Some wall base relics, embroideries, metal works of the ancient city were discovered. But what was this area used for remains obscured.It usually takes two to three decades to finish unearthing a site. But one's life doesn't too have many decades. For archaeologist like Dang, the the process of unearthing a city like this is like raising a baby. Although, he and his colleagues have put much effort into this project, they are still many questions to figure out."We hope to know the city from its birth to death. We hope to understand it comprehensively through our long-time study. As we always say, although we each don't have many decades, we hope to age together in one city," said Dang. "It's worthwhile spending my entire career figuring out one city thoroughly."Filmed by Wang YuchengOn day 25 of our Amazing Xinjiang trip, we arrived in Luntai County in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in the middle of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

CGTN talked with veteran toy designer Stryker Wang who shared his inspirations and his opinion on China's toy market.During the interview, Wang showcased a little dinosaur DIO â the first member of the BeastBox series. It's a toy that can easily turn from a square into a dinosaur. The designer introduced the inspiration of the toy: "No matter what the shape of the toy is, it will always be wrapped up in a square box. So we thought why can't we make the toy a box, and the box is the toy itself. This is how DIO the dinosaur was born.""After its release, the toy received great feedback. Many say they are glad to see that China finally has its own transformative toy. And so we continued our BeastBox series," he added.The series has attracted many followers from both home and abroad. Wang used to work in the video game industry. But he always had a passion for toys. In 2000, he started a magazine about toys. Even though the publication didn't last long, Wang found a direction for his career. He said: "I've always been a kid that likes to play. I'm very curious and always wanted to dig into areas that are not familiar to the public."During the interview, he showed reporter his first toy collection â a little Transformer."My parent gave it to me when I was in middle school as an award for good grades. Even though it is very small, it brings back precious memories. It is fair to say that it is the beginning of my toy career," Wang said. The pop-culture trend of art toys has been developing and maturing in recent years. They first appeared in the 1990s, and their popularity has grown. Today, that demand is strong and the market is booming. Wang said that toys have always been a representation of culture through human development. For young people, toys are also art."Art is not only vases or oil paintings, toys are also a contemporary expression of art. I think the toy culture is very diverse. I hope more people can pay attention to them and realize that they are part of people's lives that are worth collecting and studying," he said. Wang believes that there are plenty of talented toy designers in China, but what's lacking are original styles and a healthy market. "I believe China's toy industry surpasses those of Japan and the U.S. at the base level. By that I mean industrial technology and human input. But on an ideological level we are still far behind. There's a lot to learn, like the ways of thinking and the experience from decades of practice," he said."However I think the gap is narrowing. With the rapid development of China's economy and its toy business, we are now having a lot of cooperation with designers globally," the designer added. "Be an interesting person, do fun things" â Wang says this is a motto for him and his company. He believes as long as people in the industry have true passion and love for this business, China's toy market is sure to grow stronger.Art toys, also known as designer toys, are meant for adults with a collection value produced with creative ideas.

In its holds we discovered military vehicles, porcelain and many crates with contents still unknown."The Karlsruhe had been taking part in Operation Hannibal, one of the largest sea evacuations in history, which helped more than one million German troops and civilians from East Prussia escape the Soviet advance towards the end of World War II.  Documentation from the time suggests the boat left Koenigsberg in a hurry, with a large cargo and 1,083 people onboard."All this, put together, stimulates the human imagination. Finding the German steamer and the crates with contents as yet unknown resting on the bottom of the Baltic Sea may be significant for the whole story," said diver Tomasz Zwara.The Amber Room was constructed in Prussia and then given to Tsar Peter the Great of Russia in 1716 as a present.The Germans dismantled it and took it to Koenigsberg during the war, from where it disappeared during Allied bombing raids on the city. Many believe it was destroyed.

They were already down about 80 percent this year, due to the impact of the pandemic on the entertainment industry.  The company reopened its UK cinemas in July but customers numbers have been small since then.Cineworld's CEO, Moody Greidinger, said it was "not a decision we made lightly.""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings," he added. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time."Greidinger's statement also highlighted the challenges the firm faced in getting studios to release new movies.  Cineworld was hoping the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, could help turn around its fortunes. But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added. The world's second largest cinema chain, Cineworld, is temporarily shutting its theaters in the U.S. and the UK.The move is due to low footfall as a result of COVID-19 and puts 45,000 jobs at risk, including 5,500 in the UK.Cineworld's shares in London plunged more than 50 percent at one stage on Monday.

One of the essential pieces of Latin America's culture is shaped by the native inhabitants. We spoke to one man in Colombia who has dedicated his life to the conservation of indigenous rights.  Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter. Subscribe here!Twenty-eight-year-old Ye Luying is undoubtedly one of the most impressive painters among the rising Chinese painters in recent years. Her cartoon-style "Nymph of the Luo River" or "Luoshenfu" won many prizes, including the best illustration award at the 13th Golden Dragon Award for Chinese Animation held in 2016. The painting is based on the author Cao Zhi from the Wei Dynasty (220-265) and his admiration for a water goddess. In his narratives, Cao used flowery language to describe her and their sincere love.Many say that Ye perfectly combines both Western culture and eastern culture in her adaption of ancient paintings. But Ye herself doesn't really agree."I think my paintings are deeply rooted in my hometown and our Chinese culture. I'm a native Chinese. My paintings just look slightly Western in format," Ye told CGTN.Ye studied at the Chinese Academy of Art and the Oslo National Academy of the Arts in Norway. She has also traveled to over 20 countries. She said those experiences might contribute to her  mixed painting style."Many people like me had the experience of studying abroad. We've not only seen Gu Kaizhi but also Michelangelo. This so-called Eastern-Western mixed style is something that comes out naturally from my mind,â she said.Over the past decade, Ye has completed several painting books based on ancient Chinese stories and calligraphy works, including the "Preface of the Orchid Pavilion" ("Lanting Xu') and "Mulan."Reflecting on her years of practice, Ye joked that painting itself is labor-intensive work, like climbing a mountain."I feel the happiest when I'm drawing drafts because I can draw whatever I want. Another moment I feel the happiest is when I finally finish a certain piece. That will give me a sense of fulfillment,â Ye told CGTN.During the interview, Ye also revealed her plan to make a piece related to cats as she is a cat-person. She also said she longs for some breakthrough in future works."I'm more unrestrained and vigorous than what I've presented in my drawings. I hope I can make more imaginative work in the future. I think I'll get the chance to do it. That's very likely," Ye said.Reporter: Deng JunfangVideographer: Shen Langlang, Deng JunfangVideo editor: Zhang ChunnanProject manager: Deng JunfangProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiTwenty-eight-year-old Ye Luying is undoubtedly one of the most impressive painters among the rising Chinese painters in recent years. Her cartoon-style "Nymph of the Luo River" or "Luoshenfu" won many prizes, including the best illustration award at the 13th Golden Dragon Award for Chinese Animation held in 2016. The painting is based on the author Cao Zhi from the Wei Dynasty (220-265) and his admiration for a water goddess.

Teng Kuixing, jury member and also a famous voice director, shared his thoughts with CGTN.With more than two decades of dubbing experience, Teng has given voice to many popular cartoons including "Dragon Balls" and "Crayon Shin Chain." In 2015, Teng was the voice director for the Chinese animation film "Monkey King: Hero Is Back," which was described as the future of domestic animation.Speaking of the work, Teng vividly recalls the process of creation."The creative process was very, very difficult at the beginning. Every line was recorded dozens of times. As you can imagine, we got very tired and numb. We take a break and then go on to the next one, and then come back and listen," he said. "Language is like a musical instrument. It must be in the correct position, no more or less, to arouse the audience's emotions. So, we go back and forth," he added.There were five competition areas in total, with a network competition area on the new media platform. Dubbing fans only needed to upload their works on the network platform to participate in the competition.Following the start of registration on June 16, more than 3,000 entries were received from six regions. The quality of the entries has been greatly improved compared with previous years, among which non-professional competitors account for a large proportion.Having won the Best Mentor Award, Teng thinks the competition has been getting more and more professional. "In both team and individual competitions, the ability displayed is higher than that of previous ones. Of course, we do it every year, and it's going to get better and better, and that's also what we're looking forward to," he said.The participation of more and more professional competitors reflects the growing strength of the industry. As an expert, Teng said there is still a long way to go for the competitors. "More and more people are taking this as a career in this industry currently. Therefore, the elimination rate is higher and requirements keep on getting higher. Only by being better can you stay and have a chance to stand out," he said.Reporter: Yang MengVideographer: Shen LanglangVideo editor: Zhang ChunnanCover image designer: Chen YuyangProject manager: Deng JunfangProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiWinners of the Character Voice Competition were unveiled at the 16th China International Cartoon and Animation Festival (CICAF).

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

Other artifacts and at least 28 statues were found in the two deep wells, the ministry said.A sealed door was also unearthed where it is expected more mummies may lie behind, said Khaled el-Anany the first Minister of Antiquities and Tourism, adding that the artifacts were in an excellent state of preservation and would be displayed in the Grand Egyptian museum next year.Mostafa Waziri, the general director of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told NBC News that the discovery reminded him of the tomb of King Tutankhamun, because both had been discovered almost intact.The Saqqara plateau is part of the necropolis of Egypt's ancient city of Memphis.

In it, the 87-year-old Zhou Quandi, who lost both his hands, writes âæç¾æ´æ, ä¿å®¶å«å½â (meaning "Resist the U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to defend my homeland") to commemorate the 70th anniversary of when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) joined the War to Resist U.S. Aggression. In June 1950, the Korean War broke out after the Korean Peninsula was split into north and south. The United States sent troops and dispatched ships and aircraft to meddle in the Sino-Korean border. Facing American threats, the newly founded People's Republic of China decided in October to participate in the war to defend its national security and help its neighbor, calling it the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.Hundreds of thousands of young people in China joined the war to defend their homeland, including then 17-year-old Zhou.According to Zhou's memories, Korea suffered unprecedented cold weather that year. PVA soldiers braved temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, eating potatoes and drinking snow water to quench their thirst while carrying out combat missions in the Hwangchoryong area in Korea."We lay on the snow for three days. On the last night, when we finally started to fight the enemy, I couldn't get up anymore. My feet and hands were numb," said Zhou.After the battle, other PVA soldiers found Zhou unconscious in the snow and already suffering from frostbite. If he did not undergo surgery immediately, his life would be in danger. Due to the lack of anesthetics, the doctor wrapped his limbs with ice cubes and performed the amputation while he was in a coma with a high fever.After the surgery, the doctor said, "If he doesn't wake up within seven days, he will die."Zhou's strength helped him survive. Although he lost both his hands and legs, he didn't give up. After returning to China, he took care of his basic needs and also found the will power to practice calligraphy despite inherent difficulties.Over the past decades, Zhou completed nearly 2,000 calligraphy pieces and won many awards in various calligraphy competitions.Zhou's patriotism and perseverance have moved and inspired many Chinese netizens.A video of a veteran amputee doing calligraphy is tugging at the heartstrings of many Chinese netizens.

Ninety-three percent of film companies recorded more than 75 percent losses in the second quarter of 2020. If the status quo persists, 69 percent of small and medium-sized film companies will be forced to declare bankruptcy or close permanently, and 66 percent of theater jobs will be lost.

Also we've brought back the Zaocha æ©è¶ or Morning Tea, a must-do tradition for many locals, so visitors get an authentic taste of local delicacies."Usually at this time of the year, tourists and theater lovers would be flocking into the little town for its annual theater festival.The event has been postponed to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But some still linger for Wuzhen's unique charm.One visitor said that she came here at least twice a year and the view in October is quite different from March and April.Another visitor revealed that for her Wuzhen is more than just a tourist site, it is a cultural symbol and her favorite place is this lantern shop where she could really feel the festive vibe.As Wuzhen goes into the first national week holiday amid COVID-19 pandemic, staff are taking every precaution so that visitors can have a safe and pleasant stay here."Wuzhen stands out from other tourist sites because of its high standard of management in accommodation and restoration," Yao Jie, CEO Assistant of Wuzhen Tourism Co. Ltd., told CGTN, adding "For the National Day holiday season we're implementing a series of strict anti-epidemic measures, like regular disinfection, no contact check-ins and check-outs."The newly renovated Tourist Service Center as well as some older stores will also make their debut.These upgraded faculties will not only provide a more spacious and comfortable space at the reception, but also provide tourists with more services and interactive features. Wuzhen, which reopened in April, is expecting a major increase in visitor numbers over the National Day holiday week.The old city of Beijing is lined with hutongs. They are small meandering alleyways that form a maze of siheyuan, which are single-story homes surrounded by open-air courtyards. Life in the hutong neighborhoods follows a slow pace, giving an atmosphere of days gone by. In many ways, the hutong is more than just an architectural concept. It is a way of life and a living imprint of time. Over the years, many dwellings have been falling apart and truly authentic hutongs are no longer ideal living spaces by today's standards.This is why preserving and restoring hutongs have become an important point of discussion in the urban development of Beijing. Recently, the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center joined hands with Beijing Tian Heng Development Group to revitalize Beijing Shi Cha Hai's hutong neighbourhoods. Hu Xinyu, trustee of Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center (CHP), believes the collaboration between the two is "a perfect match."Hu explains that as a state-owned company, Tian Heng has the capability to acquire courtyards that need repair. And CHP, as a charity group, has the capacity to mobilize volunteers, and contribute to the design and heritage preservation measure in regenerating courtyards. Over the past eight years, Tian Heng has looked to restore 100 courtyards, 30 of which are still under construction.To conserve and protect the courtyard homes, Chen Liming, head of engineering department at Tian Heng adheres to a strict set of principles. "Fix and repair" is the mantra he follows when refurbishing courtyard homes. "Keep what's worth keeping" is also important.For one project, Chen had a new wall built from old bricks retained from the original structure before it was taken down."If we can't keep the entire structure, then we preserve at least parts of it," Chen states.Finally, "recycle what's reusable." Chen believes things like old tiles, wooden frames, and cornerstones are "time prints." Adding them back into the new house and the refurbished home will give it its own distinctive personality. For this year's Beijing Design Week, Tian Heng presented several remodeled projects to the public. Some are rooms transformed into Airbnbs, while others are courtyard homes turned into boutique hotels. These reinvented spaces encourage interaction between local residents and visitors, giving these old neighborhoods a new purpose while maintaining their historical faÃ§ade. Renovating the courtyards by redesigning them in a new light is another way architects are reviving the hutongs. Yinyuan, or the "Invisible Yard" at Bao Chao Hutong had been vacant and deserted over the past five years. But this summer, the 50 square meter courtyard home had a revolutionary makeover. Mirrored floors are used to bring the hutong skyscape into the private alley and see-through glass walls are installed to lighten up the living area. As for existing brickwork and the original wooden beams, they are left exposed across the interior to contrast the new intervention, creating a dialogue between the past and future.Over the past decade, a growing number of Chinese and international architects have been revitalizing these iconic architectures. They are exploring new possibilities for hutongs by reinventing their spaces and re-adapting their uses. But the impact these urban interventions and renovations will have on the hutongs and their rustic charm, only time will tell. The old city of Beijing is lined with hutongs.

Through a tidy array of lights, the enormous natural power is seen pushing the waves forward and pounding against riverbanks harshly, as if countless of silver dragons were vigorously swimming.Under the background of light beams near the river, viewers can savor a skillful water painting created by nature.It looks like a landscape painting on water, but on a closer look, it also looks like a flowing music score that plays grandiose symphonies.According to local authorities, the scenic area has received more than 5,000 visitors within five days by October 1. The number of daily views is estimated to reach a peak on October 4, the 18th day of the eighth month on Chinese lunar calendar, when the tidal bores reach their most spectacular moment.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Jingjie)Now is the best time to admire the Tidal Bore of the Qiantang River, an annual natural spectacle, in east China's coastal city.The picturesque scene featuring magnificent tidal bores rushing under the luminous moon attracted crowds of locals and visitors in Haining City, Zhejiang Province on Thursday night.Since ancient times, the world-famous Qiantang Tidal Bore, which is created by the gravity from the moon and the rotation of the Earth, has been hailed as a "marvelous spectacle on earth."One of the world's largest tidal bores ushered in the best time of the year for sightseeing with the advent of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, coinciding with China's National Day.It has been a great tradition and local custom in the eastern province for over 2,000 years to enjoy the natural wonder and celebrate under the full moon around the festival, when the tidal waves become the biggest bores.The best vantage point for watching the amazing back-flow bore in Haining City made a big innovation this year to improve tourists' experience.Tourists flocking to the riversides can enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to not only hear but watch the amazing scene at night owing to the elaborately designed light beam arrays.The Qiantang Tidal Bore is also called "the Silver Dragon" by locals.

It is the first long holiday over three days since the coronavirus epidemic broke out in January.The tourism industry suffered a heavy blow during the epidemic. With the epidemic largely under control in the country, people are pinning high hopes on the holiday for a tourism boost. Preferential price stimulates tourism boomOne month before the holiday, travel agencies introduced various discounts and subsidies to attract tourists.China's top online travel platform Ctrip rolled out 1 billion yuan of subsidies for the National Day holiday on September 7, while its contender Fliggy backed by Alibaba announced a 10-billion-yuan-subsidy plan one day after. These can be used to book train tickets, hotels and scenic spot tickets.For example, if the subsidies are properly used, the ticket price for Shanghai Disney Resort can reach as low as 199 yuan compared to its normal price of 500 to 700 yuan, and the ticket price for some popular destinations, such as Beijing's Palace Museum and Guangzhou Chimelong Tourist Resort, can be halved.Scenic spots themselves have also striven to attract more visitors, with more than 500 across China exempting or reducing ticket prices. Central China's Hubei Province, which was hardly-hit by the epidemic earlier this year, opened all of its national A-level scenic spots for free to tourists from August to December 31.To further promote consumption, regional governments in collaboration with eCommerce platforms and local business owners, give out consumption vouchers.East China's Shandong Province will issue consumption vouchers valued at 20 million yuan during the holiday, which can be used on more than 340,000 cultural and tourist products. Beijing is scheduled to hand out 12.5 million vouchers in seven batches in October, among which are meal vouchers used in onsite restaurants and take-away food.Epidemic prevention measures taken to keep safetyTo meet the tourists' demand during the holiday, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism recently raised the capped number of tourists from 50 percent to 75 percent in scenic spots.The Palace Museum raised the limited number of visitors from 12,000 to 30,000 since Thursday, the most since it reopened. But visitors should book the ticket online in advance, which is a common practice in most scenic spots across the country.Tourists are also arranged to visit in staggered time. Xinhua reported that 90 percent of 280 national 5A-level scenic spots have set up the booking system for tourists to visit in batches.For open-air scenic spots, such as Chaka Salt Lake in northwest China's Qinghai Province, increased number of staff members and volunteers have been deployed to prevent large crowds gathering.China saw 108 million visits and raked in 76.5 billion yuan in tourism income on October 2, the second day of the National Day holiday, while the first day observed a total of 97 million visits with 76.7 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in tourism income, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, raising people's expectation for a tourism boom.This year, the National Day coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, marking an extended holiday of eight days.

People across the country reunite with family and friends, and enjoy the charm of moon together. Some people will choose to watch Peking Opera during the festivities, classic opera "Drunken Concubine" is one of the most widely circulated ones. It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera. "Drunken Concubine" has been performed in many countries including Russia, Austria and North Korea.Mid-Autumn Festival meets Peking OperaYu Kuizhi and Li Shengsu are two Peking Opera masters of the China National Peking Opera Company.

Mei took the traditional Chinese art abroad in the early 20th century, impressing foreign audiences with his beautiful voice and unforgettable performances. "Peking Opera needs to be passed down from one generation to the next, and our cultural exchanges with other countries also needed to be passed down like this," Yu told CGTN. Traditional festivals give people a chance to know more about time-honored culture like the Peking Opera, and also allows people to enjoy the country's national treasures. (Cover image designed bu Xu Qianyun)The Mid-Autumn Festival falls on October 1 this year, marking one of the most important and poetic Chinese festivals.

With an average age of 90, the artists have made significant contributions to the development of this art-form in China.In total, there are 40 oil paintings on show at Beijing's Longfu Art Center. They were created by major figures in Chinese oil painting â Zhan Jianjun, Jin Shangyi, Quan Shanshi, Zhong Han and Wen Lipeng. They each devoted some 70 years to the art form, and established their own style and artistic language. It's the first time for them to have an exhibition together. "Our generation of painters, we have a sense of responsibility. After studying oil painting, we want to develop this art form in China. It's not like traditional Chinese painting, which has deep foundations in China. Oil panting was imported from the west. So we feel responsible to study it and promote it," said Wen Lipeng. Often addressed as the third generation of Chinese oil painters, the artists have played an important role in promoting oil painting in China. They are also the founders of the China Oil Painting Society. "In the past decades, the China Oil Painting Society has organized many exhibitions. And this time, I'm glad to see an exhibit that features us old people. It's a reminiscence as well as a new beginning for the China Oil Painting Society," said Jin Shangyi.Even in old age, the artists still have a strong desire to create. Many of the works in the exhibition are recent, giving audiences a chance to admire their artistic vitality. What the artists have in common is their insistence on developing oil paintings with a Chinese style. They studied the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western art in great depth. By mastering Western painting skills and combining them with traditional Chinese culture, the artists have managed to create works with unique Chinese characteristics. "The key question is in which direction Chinese oil painting should develop. I think we are clear that we need to follow the Chinese road. It is oil painting, but it's Chinese oil painting," said Wen Lipeng.The exhibition runs until November 30 and is free to the public.An exhibition showcasing the works of five prominent figures who have shaped the Chinese oil painting scene is on display in Beijing.

Its executive chef is 27-year-old trailblazer Lucas Sin.We find Sin in the kitchen of his Greenwich Village restaurant, ready to whip up a dish for a new onsite pop-kitchen called "Nice Day Chinese Takeout" that pays homage to American Chinese foodâ¦ a cuisine that has long fascinated Sin, an immigrant from Hong Kong."This is our take on chow mein, which is very popular in American Chinese restaurants," explained Sin from behind his mask as he speaks over a sizzling wok. "But the way we do it, the sauce that we put in, is more similar to the original Cantonese version than the American version."Sin's take on this quintessential American Chinese recipe hints at how the chef has kept the business going strong in a pandemic that has crippled the economy."I wanted to keep cooking creatively, and I wanted to keep thinking about the things I was interested in despite the pandemic."Sin was eager to defy stereotypes about Chinese food and give it the respect he felt the cuisine deserves, but he also wanted to explore the reach and evolution of Chinese food across cultures."I wanted to give my team a chance to research and think about how Chinese food might actually be good for you," he said.  "There's this sentiment that Chinese food must be bad for you if people are getting sick in China, there's that end of the narrative, and there's also my research in how big Chinese cuisine is across the Chinese diaspora all over the world."With restaurants only permitted take-out and deliveries, Junzi Kitchen launched several new initiatives including its "Share A Meal" program to help feed frontline workers.For his customers, he kicked off a series called "Distance Dining" in which he partnered with a diverse range of chefs to design fully cooked three-course meals that customers can order in advance, to show how Chinese food intersects with the cuisine of other cultures, from Creole to West African."Chinese food seems to have almost an uncanny ability to be everywhere around the world (and) touch so many different communities. I wanted to explore those intersections."Once the food is delivered, diners can tune in to an Instagram Live session with Sin and other chefs for a demonstration on how to properly heat the food for an authentic experience.Straight from the chefs' home kitchens, the sound of cooking is accompanied by a dash of banter and a sprinkle of humor. For those hungry for human connection in these strange times, it puts the "social" in social distancing.But the pandemic has been anything but social. For America's Chinese community, the coronavirus emerged as relations between China and the U.S. deteriorated and spilled over into Chinese communities.In New York, Chinese restaurants were hit by a one-two punch from the pandemic's economic fallout as well as a spike in racism against Asians, fueled by the White House which blamed China for the coronavirus.There were increasing reports of Asians being attacked or verbally assaulted, and Chinese restaurants vandalized and defaced. Sin had beer cans and a fluorescent light bulb thrown at him."Obviously, I'm surprised," Sin said."I think the wonderful thing about coming here to the U.S. as an immigrant is that I have the privilege of not needing to think of myself as a minority, but when friends in the industry especially have been facing expressive anti-Chinese sentiment, I think that's when it really hits home the most," he added.The upside, according to Sin, is that some in the businesses have chosen to build resilience. That might explain Junzi Kitchen's own story of survival."Our primary mission at Junzi is to show people that Chinese food is more wonderful and diverse than they might think otherwise," he told us."Just because there's a pandemic out there doesn't mean that the mission goes away."Unable to weather the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many restaurants in New York City have gone out of business, but one has defied the odds by focusing on the diversity of Chinese food and the power of social media.The restaurant is Junzi Kitchen, a modern fast-casual Chinese eatery in Manhattan that serves up fare described as authentic, honest and straightforward.

The event aims to stimulate the city's nighttime economy in places where drinks, food, and entertainment are offered. Everyone has free access to dozens of festival venues that the local government has set for its more than ten million people. Visitors attending it will find temperature and security checks along with health regulations when they arrive. The goal is to enjoy the event and contribute to the city revival. When it kicked off last weekend, the main venue in Dongxihu District didn't expect the tens of thousands of visitors who turned out, according to the organizer. "We didn't have enough on the first day, as many places serving beer and food were sold out within just half an hour," said Li Jiange, deputy chief of the Business Bureau of Dongxihu. "So, we doubled it the next day, but all of it went quickly again." Given the situation, many wondered if a mass gathering could be done safely. Officials say they conduct daily disinfection before the event. Health workers are monitoring the crowd. Besides, no local cases have been reported for months since Wuhan offered free mass testing in May. "You know, when you now walk in the city, everybody appears to have put those fears aside," said one visitor who celebrated his 50th birthday over some beers with the family. "Since this beer festival is happening, I feel like it's a great opportunity to tell people in other cities in China that Wuhan is fine. We're definitely fine and doing well," a beer vendor said. The event also provides opportunities for many local businesses, especially those featuring agricultural products in the district. Internet celebrities were invited to livestream for them, an increasingly popular marketing strategy now in China. Some stalls are making more than a thousand dollars a day. Young local bands are also putting their first-ever performance this year. Many expect the success of this event will have a positive impact and more large gatherings can be organized in the future.  Read more: Back to normal: Wuhan water party makes overseas netizens enviousThe city of Wuhan, hit hard several months ago by the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, is holding a week-long beer festival.

Among them is opera prodigy, Chinese countertenor Liu Shen. CGTN's Shen Li caught up with him during the festival's "Music at Noon" concert to find out how he came into this career and his future plans.At this mini recital at the Beijing Music Festival, Liu wowed the audience with his performances of Henry Purcell's "Music for a While," arias from some of Handel's operas, and Claude Debussy's Art Songs. He said this varied program helped express "my many sides."Liu is a countertenor, which means he has a vocal range that extends upwards from his natural tenor into mezzo-soprano.At the age of 5, his parents took him to see "La Traviata" and he has been obsessed with opera ever since.He went on to study at the Juilliard School and has collaborated with maestros like conductor Yu Long and the world's leading orchestras.Now at 20, the opera prodigy said he's still finding his voice.Liu said, "The countertenors, they don't just sing operas, there's a lot of non-gender specific pieces that we could do, so it's the best way to express myself."When asked about whether he could like to try music from other genres, Liu revealed his interest in jazz, Broadway music and even Peking Opera. "It's important to understand other genres of music," he added.Liu is able to sing in many different languages, including Italian, French, German and even Hebrew. "My passion for opera really sparks my passion for languages, the twos are somehow connected," he said.Apart from being active on stage as a countertenor, Liu is equally passionate about acting. "Through opera, I found out so many things about acting and music combined together â the beat, the rhythm," he said. "I would love to be an opera director because you get both the perspectives," he added. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the China Philharmonic Orchestra, five young musicians born in 2000 are taking center stage at the closing concert of Beijing Music Festival on Tuesday.

They have special visas that allow them to stay for 90 days with the option to renew twice. The first 14 days have to be spent in quarantine.Among other stipulations, they also need to have proof of travel insurance and medical insurance for in and outpatient treatment, as well as for treatment for COVID-19.After landing, their papers were checked, and their temperatures were taken before they were allowed through immigration. In all, they had to pass through three thermoscans as they walked through the airport, according to airport authorities. As they queued to board buses, workers in protective clothing disinfected their luggage."We can assure everyone that all our measures are systematic and meet international standards," said the airport's deputy general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn.Chinese tourists were seen putting on raincoats as the last step before leaving for their quarantine accommodation. Kittipong said this was not a government requirement, but rather, he said, the raincoats appeared to have been part of a complimentary package of items from their hotel.Almost 40 million people visited Thailand in 2019, with tourism accounting for more than 10 percent of the country's GDP. But the halting of international flights in early April, due to the pandemic, has left the sector in dire straits. Well-known tourist spots, used to hordes of visitors, are now almost empty, as are the country's famous sandy beaches.More flights are scheduled for tourists on special visas in the coming weeks.(Cover: Chinese tourists from Shanghai arrive at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, October 20, 2020. /AP)Thailand welcomed its first foreign tourists in seven months on Tuesday, bringing a tiny ray of hope to a vital industry that has been brought to its knees by the coronavirus crisis.Thirty-nine Chinese tourists flew into Suvarnabhumi Airport on the outskirts of Bangkok on a Spring Airlines flight from Shanghai.

The director is a woman, Liana Ceterchi. "Each one of us is a facet of Ana Novac's soul and memory," Morgenstern said. The play's author, born Zimra Harsanyi, hails from Romania's northern Transylvania region. She was deported at age 14. The diary she kept inside a Nazi concentration camp was first published in Hungary in 1966 and later translated into several languages, but it only hit bookshelves in her home country in 2004. Many liken Novac's work to that of Anne Frank, author of the "The Diary of a Young Girl," which documented her life in hiding in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands before she was deported to concentration camps. "We are bearers of scars from wounds that are not directly ours, but still we carry these scars," Morgenstern said. She stressed the importance of evoking events through theatrical performance "in order to understand the ghosts of a painful past, the memories of terrible events that have split the world into executioners and victims."Actresses wear the striped outfits of concentration camps against a backdrop of images depicting camp entrances, gas chambers and empty sleeping quarters. Photographs and names of Holocaust victims scroll in a video over the stage and performers. The performers also hold human bones and a skull during monologues. The pandemic has had a severe impact on Romania's artistic community, triggering the closure of theaters during the lockdown. Later, theaters were allowed to hold performances only outdoors, then indoors with a limited number of spectators. "These are existential and also moral questions. What to do to protect life, not to be a threat but at the same time continue our existence and activity and maintain our status as artists?" Morgenstern said.(With input from AP)(Cover image: Actresses of the Jewish State Theater in Bucharest, wearing face masks for protection against COVID-19, perform during rehearsals for the premiere of "The Beautiful Days of My Youth," based on the diary of Romanian Jewish Holocaust survivor Ana Novac. /AP)The latest premiere at the Jewish State Theater in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, explores the horrors of the Holocaust via a survivor's memories of the Auschwitz and Plaszow concentration camps. Friday's debut of "The Beautiful Days of My Youth" by Romanian Jewish Holocaust survivor Ana Novac follows the National Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorations on October 9, the day when deportations of Romania's Jews and Roma began in 1941. Some 280,000 Jews and 11,000 Roma were deported and killed under Romania's pro-Nazi regime during World War II.The play premiered online and in front of spectators who took up less than a third of the seats because of measures meant to slow the coronavirus pandemic in the eastern European nation. Maia Morgenstern, head of the Jewish State Theater and a Romanian Jewish actress best known for playing Mary in Mel Gibson's controversial 2004 movie "The Passion of the Christ," described the play's staging as an "all-female project."

among those presenting honors to pandemic-era student filmmakers.The Student Academy Awards are a key program of the Hollywood film industry's top body, which has already delayed next year's Oscars as speculation builds that the glitzy main ceremony may also take place remotely."I'm hopeful, as we all are, that this will also be the last virtual Student Academy Awards," said Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president David Rubin, signaling desire that the industry can soon return to normal."Just as inflection points like the Cold War and 9/11 shaped the perspective of past generations of filmmakers from Stanley Kramer to Kathryn Bigelow, 2020 â a year like no other â will no doubt forever influence what your generation sees through the camera lens."Students honored at the online ceremony described how lockdowns around the world had affected their finishing touches to movies shot as part of their academic programs."I did change the sound of what my film would have been," said Pilar Garcia-Fernandezsesma, who won the top animation prize for her film "Ciervo" after moving back in with her parents."I ended up putting flute in my film, when I probably wouldn't have done, because I had access to my middle school flute lying around in my bedroom."Allison Waite, honored for her documentary about a Black teen shot dead in a Los Angeles convenience store, said despite the challenges of the pandemic, "being silent at this moment was not productive.""With things happening in the US, with George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, there's so much discussion to be had,"

Claude Monet masterpiece was sold in London on Wednesday for about 7.5 million pounds (about $9.8 million), the second highest price at auction for the mysterious artist.The oil on canvas work, "Show Me the Monet," a modern take on Monet's impressionist classic "The Water-Lily Pond," was sold at Sotheby's following a bidding battle."The hammer came down after five determined collectors battled for nearly nine minutes to drive the final price beyond its estimate of 3,000,000-5,000,000 pounds to become the second highest price for the artist at auction," Sotheby's said.The sale comes a year after a Banksy painting depicting the British parliament populated by chimpanzees smashed the record for the street artist by fetching nearly 9.9 million pounds.On that occasion, the 2009 work titled "Devolved Parliament" attracted a 13-minute battle between 10 different bidders."Show Me the Monet" was created in 2005, as part of a collection called "The Crude Oils" and had first been shown publicly in only Banksy's second gallery exhibition.The painting transforms Monet's masterpiece depicting a Japanese-style bridge in his famous garden at Giverny into a modern-day fly-tipping spot.Instead of an idyllic lily pond, the composition shows discarded shopping trollies and a fluorescent orange traffic cone floating in the water beneath the bridge."Ever prescient as a voice of protest and social dissent, here Banksy shines a light on society's disregard for the environment in favor of the wasteful excesses of consumerism," said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's European Head of Contemporary Art."Recent years have seen seminal Banksys come to auction, but this is one of his strongest, and most iconic, to appear yet," he added.Banksy has become a household name since the turn of the century, after his iconic graffiti paintings began to appear overnight on buildings and at sites around the world.The artist's identity remains shrouded in mystery even as his works have begun to attract increasingly high sums at auction.Meanwhile, he continues to use his art in stunts that generate huge publicity.In 2018, his "Girl With The Balloon" partially shredded itself as the hammer came down at Sotheby's, becoming the re-titled "Love Is In The Bin."(Cover: A visitor looks at Banksy's 'Show me the Monet' on display at Sotheby's in central London, UK, September 18, 2020. /CFP)An

Instead of sashes, buttons are commonly used. Coming up is the most debated one: The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) ensemble. It looks quite similar to hanfu, the traditional costume for Han Chinese, but it also breaks a few rules. The collar should lap for both men and women. The sleeves should be long and wide to meet the two words: kuan and he. Sashes should be used instead of buttons. As for Western clothing, the men's jacket is a typical example. Tailoring requires a proper fit for the individual achieved with cutting and seams. The Vietnamese ao dai, or Vietnamese long dress, is often thought to be related to hanfu, but it is more like a qipao.  The tunic is fitted with a stand-up collar fastened with buttons. It's the national costume of Vietnam. Very similar to the ao dai, the blue dress is a traditional costume mostly seen in Southern China.  The outfit does include hanfu design elements, but essentially, it is also an outfit with Western influence. The dress uses Western dimensional cutting, and its collar disqualifies it from being hanfu. Now, can you spot the differences? Read more:Tradition goes modern: What the Chinese Hanfu clothing system is all aboutWhen talking about traditional Chinese clothing, the tangzhuang (Tang suit) and the qipao (cheongsam) are probably the two best-known styles, but hanfu experts and enthusiasts insist they are not authentic. Even though they have kept traditional Chinese motifs, Western tailoring is used in the garments instead of hanfu's  plain cutting on just one piece of fabric.  Referring back to the first episode where we have talked about the eight characteristics of hanfu, they are "ping zhong jiao you, kuan tuan he ying."  In comparison, the shoulders of the tangzhuang and qipao are designed to fit.

"Christmas itself will come, but how merry it will be, that's the question mark."Finland escaped the worst effects of the pandemic in spring, opting for a strict lockdown, which included isolating the capital, Helsinki.Now, as in much of Europe, infections are on the rise again, hitting a daily record earlier this month, and the government is considering new measures to contain the spread of the virus.The country of 5.5 million people has reported nearly 13,000 COVID-19 infections in total so far, including 346 deaths.With Santa greeting kids from behind a Plexiglas screen and elves wearing masks, Christmas cheer is already in short supply.At tour company Safarctica, which offers snowmobile tours and ice-swimming, sales director Antti Antikainen, reckons bookings are set to fall 50-80 percent this year, adding: "I think it's closer to 80 percent.âTourism-oriented firms, which employ around 8% of people in the region, have already started laying off workers and many have little hope that the festive season can be saved, unless the government eases some of its travel restrictions soon."At this very moment my answer would be that Christmas is cancelled," said Harri Mallinen, who runs the Apukka Resort in Rovaniemi.Christmas is coming, but in Santa's home village in northern Finland, the COVID pandemic means that the flocks of tourists who usually start to make merry in Rovaniemi at this time of year are not.Finland has adopted some of the strictest travel restrictions in Europe, despite its low level of infections, meaning most foreigners cannot enter the country.The northern part of Finland, where many businesses rely on tourists flying in to meet Santa Claus, see the Northern Lights or take a snowmobile safari, has seen visitor numbers plummet.In August 2020, foreign tourist numbers were down 78 percent from a year earlier, according to travel industry data from Business Finland."For local businesses, definitely, Christmas is in danger," Sanna Karkkainen, managing director of Visit Rovaniemi tourist board, said.

As the camera was introduced to China in the mid-19th century, also the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), studies and researches are carried out in a more in-depth way.At a preview of an upcoming photograph auction held by Yingyi Auction House, part of the Chinese history and people's lives in the past 180 years is revealed. The barber, the courtroom, and women with bound feet were some of China's iconic images through the lens of Western photographers in the 19th century.David Knox Griffith's four books of photographs taken in China during the late Qing Dynasty are considered the highlight. As a photographer and co-founder of a studio in Shanghai, Griffith has recorded different aspects of city life across the country since the 1870s."This is the first time we have discovered such a big body of work by the British photographer, David Knox Griffith," said Li Yi, general manager of Yingyi Auctions. "The pictures he took in Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao in the late 19th century are valuable records for studying Chinese history. We can also see clear clues of the photographer's career development through these four books of pictures," Li added.Contemporary photography is quite different. Modern artistic expressions and techniques are merged into a series featuring gardens in the city of Suzhou by Chinese photographer Hong Lei."They appear in the form of photographs, but the artist has actually re-created on the original pieces two or even three times, by hand coloring it, or sanding it to reflect changes in history," said Li.The most important element in contemporary art is the artist's inspiration and ideas in creation. It's quite different from the documentary type, which just captures real moments in life, Li concluded.(Cover: A picture of three women in the late Qing Dynasty, photographer unknown. /CGTN)The history of China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing, has long been studied by scholars and history fans around the world.

An interesting change for Chinese fashion this year is plenty of Chinese elements in garments, some of which are even intended for export.Ten-year-old clothing firm Hemu has always labeled itself a Chinese-style brand, and their new designs for this season's Shanghai Fashion Week have been inspired by one of the oldest Chinese classics, the "Classics of Mountains and Rivers" (Shan Hai Jing). The ancient book tells stories of mythic geography and beasts, and the designer has brought it all into his new collections, aimed primarily at young Chinese."The fashion industry can speak for Chinese culture. Though there are more foreign markets that like Chinese designs, that market still needs to be further developed. Our major consumers are still domestic buyers who love Eastern culture and traditional Chinese handcrafts," said Yang Fengrui, founder of Hemu.Hemu is not the only Chinese brand that is focusing on China Chic. Five-year-old Mukzin is running a special show this year, with designs inspired by traditional clothing from China's Qinghai Province. Plenty of the younger customers were pretty excited by the traditional Chinese elements on the show.Local buyers' enthusiasm for China Chic is reflected in the number of orders Mukzin has received since the show opened a week ago - they're up 70 percent from this season a year ago. The company's CEO said that one of the crucial reasons for the increasing popularity of Chinese-style clothing is the widespread popularity of traditional culture in modern film and television programs."TV dramas and TV shows have a large impact on the young. There are costume dramas and reality shows such as The Rap of China and Street Dance of China. Contestants' performances have Chinese cultural elements, and all of that has a subtle impact on consumers," said George Feng, CEO of Mukzin.Chinese elements were very prominent in the new designs debuted at this season's Shanghai Fashion Week. By showing them off at the fashion gala, the Chinese-style clothing is expected to draw in a wider range of international customers.Shanghai's Spring and Summer 2021 Fashion Week is now presenting the city's fashionistas with plenty of new design debuts.

Many stories depict farmers, describing the significant transformation of China's rural areas over the past 40 years and reflecting the twists and turns of their spiritual sublimation in the transformation.China's first rural-themed TV series, "Three Families," aired on China Central Television on May 22, 1978, marked the beginning of the development of TV series in the new era, which is also a reflection of the reform and opening-up of the countryside.The story of the three families revolves around a 100 yuan loan (about $63.4 back then). One of the families needs the money for their pig farm and one for their child's wedding. In those days, as little as 100 yuan could cause a big problem for the whole family.Since the middle and late 1980s, rural teleplays began to focus on the spiritual impact and transformation of farmers in the early stage of this historic transformation.Adapted from Han Zhijun's novel "Destiny Quartet," three-part TV drama "Rural Trilogy" has a different emphasis. The work not only describes the remarkable changes brought by the reform and opening-up of the countryside but also offers an in-depth look at how people deal with the challenges of adjusting to new modern values.Since 2003, rural-themed teleplays have ushered in the creation of the second bumper period. âLiu Laogen," "Ma Dashuai" and many other TV series are beginning to focus on migrant workers in cities. Many TV series have also started to gather stars to portray the roles that appeal to many viewers.Driven by the national strategy of lifting people out of poverty in all respects by 2020, there is still room for further exploration in the development of rural teleplays. Many of the themes focus on the impact of the nation's policies. More than that, TV shows are no longer limited by subject matter or time and have started to set their stories in a longer historical context."The Ordinary World," "White Deer Plain" and "The Old Farmer" combine the rural theme with drama narration, which adds a historical background and ideological depth to the works.(Top image designer: Pan Yufei.)The content changes of rural-themed teleplays are closely related to the history of rural reform and poverty alleviation in China.2020 is the year for China to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, which means that the root of poverty that has held Chinese people back for thousands of years will be cut off.In this great historical process, many TV series have been paying close attention to the countryside.

When did it begin? How is it being expressed? And how far will it go? You may find the answers in this special exhibition entitled, "Immaterial/Re-material: A Brief History of Computing Art" at the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.The past, present and future of computing art. This group exhibition at Beijing's UCCA has gathered more than 70 pieces by more than 30 artists from around the world, from pioneers of the 1960s to today's emerging voices. "The exhibition at UCCA is by far the largest exhibition dedicated to digital art so far, and I'm very proud that we present four generations of digital artists, of artists who invented new forms and new images to express a new vision of the world," Jerome Neutres, the curator, said in a prerecorded video at the opening.The title "Immaterial/Re-Material" pays tribute to Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard's groundbreaking 1985 exhibition "Les ImmatÃ©riaux," which conceived a new mode of art that reflected the decade's advances in telecommunications technology. By exploring the broad possibilities of computing art and the philosophies underpinning it, the exhibition aims to present the medium not just as a new media form but an entire artistic language.Interactive installations and AI learning is a recurring theme for participating artists.In this "Eye Calligraphy Project," artist Michel Paysant paints with his eyes using his eye tracker connected to an industrial robot equipped with a calligraphy brush. The force of thought and interior design help to realize the "digital calligraphies" of a new generation. Amid the global pandemic, artists believe that exploring computing art is a fitting topic, as technology has more closely connected us."What interests me most is taking this thing that exists in the digital world and bringing it into reality and presenting it as something that viewers can observe many different angles. So, it's not about imagery. It is not about text; it's really about something deeper that we respond to," said Leo Villareal, one of the participating artists."I think that's what we need right now in the world, things that bind us together, things that we can all connect to. So, that's where my work comes from, and I hope that it can help to dissolve some of these boundaries and some of the divisions we're experiencing in the world today."The exhibition runs until January 17, 2021. Computing art is gaining recognition as another medium of artistic expression.

So, that's where my work comes from, and I hope that it can help to dissolve some of these boundaries and some of the divisions we're experiencing in the world today."The exhibition runs until January 17, 2021. Tim Yip, also known as Ye Jintian, the world-renowned art director, visual artist, stage and costume designer as well as the first Chinese to win an Academy Award, shared his views on arts and films with CGTN during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF) in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.'Films and arts are inseparable'Tim Yip has worked with many influential film directors and artists across the globe and is an Academy Award-winning art director. Once depicting himself as the artist who really loves movies, he believes that films and art are inseparable.He won an Oscar for the best art direction in the martial arts blockbuster "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in 2001, making him more outstanding in the film industry than in other fields like theater, costume design and visual arts which he is also good at.Yip said before shooting this film, he spent a long time studying the art of dance in different dynasties in ancient China, and held many exhibitions as well as participated in many large-scale arts festivals in Europe."Films and arts are inseparable," he said, adding that he would spend a lot of time understanding how the director sees the world, which helps him decipher what kind of a world they would like to see. And after that, he will try to find the most lively and diverse ways to present what directors try to express in the film work.As for how Chinese cinema can become more international, Yip told CGTN that when the Chinese outshine foreign directors in arts, they will shoot films others can't compete with.He also said that director Wim Wenders is one of the famous directors in the world that has a great influence on his creation and personality. Inspired by the way he shot his notable documentary "Notebook On Cities &amp; Clothes (1989)," he noted that Wenders has changed the way to approach film documentaries. For example, the film "The Salt of the Earth" was shot in a dramatic way by presenting many striking photos.Apart from dedicating himself to the film industry, Yip has held many exhibitions showcasing his costumes, photographs, installations and videos across the globe. Yip once pointed out the concept of "New Orientalism" aesthetic, which has spanned across films, dance, theater and opera, and it is about conveying the aesthetic of unique Chinese culture to the international world."The 'New Orientalism' concept is not restricted to culture, it is open to all fields," he explained. "I have done a lot of study on the Chinese philosophy about 'Xu Shi Bing Zhi,' it is something like the existence and non-existence can come together."'The pandemic gives me more time to think'The COVID-19 pandemic might have badly hit the global film industry, but it has prompted many people to calm down and rethink the world and life."The pandemic on the other hand, gives me more time to think," he said, adding that prior to COVID-19, the world was moving at breakneck speed, forcing people to do many things at the same time. It was propelling people to rush forward. "While in the pandemic era, I have been forced to calm down and appreciate the depths of time."When it comes to what efforts should be made to adapt to climate change in the post-pandemic era, Yip noted that we should do something for our planet. When he was once invited to visit Norway, he said they could see shrinking glaciers, and they looked like "corpses" because there was electronic and kitchen waste in the water, which was a very serious matter. Reporter: She Jingwei Videographer: Danzeng Jiancuo Video editor: Chen ShiTim Yip, also known as Ye Jintian, the world-renowned art director, visual artist, stage and costume designer as well as the first Chinese to win an Academy Award, shared his views on arts and films with CGTN during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF) in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.'Films and arts are inseparable'Tim Yip has worked with many influential film directors and artists across the globe and is an Academy Award-winning art director.

Established in August 1958, Western Film Group, also known as Xi'an Film Studio, is one of the six major film groups in China.Among the national film production units, Xi'an Film Studio was the first to win the highest awards at international A-level film festivals. It has won more than 300 domestic and foreign awards, including Golden Palm Award, Golden Bear Award, Silver Lion Award in Cannes International Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival and Venice International Film, leading the country. It also has the most number of film exports in the country. Some of its representative films include "Farewell My Concubine," "Old Well," "Red Sorghum," "Tuya's Marriage," "Beautiful Feet," "My 1919," and "A Chinese Odyssey" series. Moreover, a large number of top Chinese directors and movie stars have worked with Xi'an Film Studio, such as Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, Gu Changwei, Gong Li and Chen Chong.The Belt and Road in Film PostersDuring the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF), Xi'an Film Studio is hosting several forums and events, including an exhibition titled "The Belt and Road in Film Posters." On display are a range of original film posters collected by the studio from all over the world in the past five years. The design, aesthetics and psychology of the posters reflect the nature of the films as well as the times in which they were released. At the same time, these posters reflect the hundred-year history of the ever-changing film industry.The exhibition is divided into five sections: The Earliest Film Posters, European and American Film Posters, Original Drawn Posters, Hong Kong Film Posters, and Xi'an Film Studio Classic Film Posters.The Earliest Film PostersThese film posters originated from commercial posters. There were hand-painted or lithographic-printed in the beginning. Painted in original colors, they have different sizes, from extra small to extra large. This exhibition has the smallest movie poster in the world, about 6 square cm, as well as the largest poster in the world, composed of two A0 posters.In the early 20th century, Thomas Edison united many studios to form a film patent alliance, which established the earliest specifications and standards for film posters.In this context, also on display is the incorrect version of the poster of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" â it shows Snow White with six dwarfs.European and American Film PostersIt also features various styles of posters from Europe and the U.S., such as classic Hollywood, surrealism and so on. With increasing cultural exchanges, the artistic styles of film posters influenced each other, thereby enriching the artistry of film posters.In this section, Xi'an Film Studio has created special corners for Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe and the film "Singin' in the Rain."It also exhibits the scooter that Audrey Hepburn rode with Gregory Peck in "Roman Holiday," brought all the way from Italy to Xi'an.Also on display is the most beautiful movie poster in the world â a poster designed by German artist Heinz for the classic silent film "Metropolis."Original Drawn PostersAs film posters were originally hand-painted â vivid with a strong sense of storytelling â many became collectible items. Appreciating a hand-painted film poster is just like appreciating a painting.Hong Kong Film PostersHong Kong Film Posters have their unique regional style. Because of the limited cinema space, these posters are usually small with superimposed pictures of the featuring artists. This is specially true for martial arts films made in Hong Kong, as the well-known Shaw Brothers Pictures, Golden Harvest Pictures and the likes brought Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and other such famous names to fame.Xi'an Film Studio Classic Film PostersXi'an Film Studio has a time-honored legacy and intentional reputation of winning more than 300 awards from China and abroad. It has ushered Chinese films to the world and was the cradle of the fifth generation of directors in China. Many posters created for those classic films produced by Xi'an Film Studio have been exhibited.Car and Film ExhibitionCars and films, two great gifts of the 19th century, have had a tremendous impact on human society. Cars change people's speed of travel, while films affect people's thoughts. When cars drive into films, they are not only props, but also vivid characters showing speed and passion, romance and elegance, technology and innovation. All sorts of classic cars exhibited at Xi'an Film Studio museum have participated in films made by the studio, such as "The Xi'an Incident."The Cine Film LibraryThe Cine Film Library stores a large number of films, including clip materials, formal copies and magnetic recording, serving as a hub of storage, protection, restoration and loan. So far, the library has collected various genres of films and resources, totaling 18,356 copies, including 9,595 copies of material, 6,875 copies of remaining clips and 1,886 copies of magnetic recording.Experiencing 'A Chinese Odyssey'The most fun part of the exhibition is a tour to experience "A Chinese Odyssey", allowing audiences to interact with characters in the movie and go through classic scenes in the movie, such as Bak Jing-Jing's horrifying skeleton hole, almost like a mini version of Universal. A Chinese Odyssey is a two-part 1995 Hong Kong fantasy-comedy film directed by Jeffery Lau and starring Stephen Chow. The film is very loosely based on the 16th-century Wu Cheng'en novel "Journey to the West." Most of the movie scenes were shot in Xi'an Film Studio.This exhibition is a heaven for film lovers and even for escape-room game fans (the Odyssey part). If you have plans to visit Xi'an, definitely put Xi'an Film Studio on your visit list.Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, is the starting point for Chinese films going global since the country's reform and opening-up.

What some might herald as triumphant regeneration can seem to others like a triumphalist celebration of power; well-meaning schemes to clean up deprived areas can often sweep away what made them vibrant neighborhoods to begin with. There is also the question of taste and style, and the inherent problems when changing fashions are applied not to clothing but to buildings, which should be rather more permanent but are often victim to the sweeping statements of incoming ideologues. Infamously, the Modernist-influenced reconstruction of social housing in the third quarter of the 20th century in the UK especially raised unloved "streets in the sky" by razing the sort of centrally located terraced houses that are now highly prized, and therefore highly expensive, as family homes.   However, those allegedly Modernist high-rises owed much less to architectural idealism than they did to manufacturing opportunism, in particular the cheap modular techniques keenly adopted by cash-conscious authorities. When cheap construction caused expensive problems â many 1960s projects have required extensive renovation or expensive replacement â the blame was laid upon the idea rather than the practice, the form rather than the content. It needn't be that way, and perhaps the impending "green" renovation of Europe's ageing building stock can be based upon more permanent foundations, conceived with the longest-term plans in mind. Reconstruction timeOn September 16, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the EU's new Green Deal would have high ideals. While one major strand of the ecological plan â to cut carbon emissions by 55 percent before 2030 â was reducing vehicle emissions, Von der Leyen was also eyeing the very architecture of Europe. "Our buildings generate 40 percent of our emissions," she noted. "They need to become less wasteful, less expensive and more sustainable. We know that the construction sector can even be turned from a carbon source into a carbon sink, if organic building materials like wood and smart technologies like AI are applied."The aims are eye-wateringly large. According to the EU's stocktaking, "more than 220 million buildings, representing approximately 85 percent of the building stock, were built before 2001." Europe has a lot of buildings, but the European Union has a lot of money to throw at them â the cost of the Green Deal has been estimated as at least $1.18 trillion as Europe aims to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.   One proposed schedule for the "Renovation Wave" of retrofitting buildings would update 2 percent of the continent's building stock every year. Building work on such a huge scale represents an enormous risk â or opportunity. As Von der Leyen said: "This is not just an environmental or economic project, it needs to be a new cultural project for Europe." Luckily, Europe is rich in cultural history, and has done this sort of thing before â which is where the Bauhaus idea comes in. "Every movement has its own look and feel," said Von der Leyen, "and we need to give our systemic change its own distinct aesthetic â to match style with sustainability. "This is why we will set up a new European Bauhaus â a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers [and] designers work together to make that happen." A 'new Bauhaus'But what exactly is this new Bauhaus? According to Von der Leyen: "The New European Bauhaus movement is intended to be a bridge between the world of science and technology and the world of art and culture. It is about a new European Green Deal aesthetic combining good design with sustainability."Wednesday's parliamentary question-and-answer session attempted to set out more details, although some of the answers raised yet more questions. The new Bauhaus "will be an interdisciplinary project, co-steered by an advisory board of external experts including scientists, architects, designers, artists, planners and civil society that will create experimental spaces where art, culture, science and technology can imagine, test and demonstrate new solutions."So far, so inclusive. The expansive ideals will go across multiple disciplines: "All Bauhaus projects would deal with the built environment as a whole but would focus on different aspects, such as climate challenges, accessibility, social cohesion, digital construction, sustainable bio-resources etc... and be in different countries."  As such, the new Bauhaus is described as an "accelerator for affordable and aesthetically promising green and digital solutions, technologies and products." Welcoming proposals, the Commission will "conduct a broad participatory co-creation process."For the time being, then, it is something of a talking shop as it attempts to create a unified ethos and aesthetic from the notoriously competitive world of architecture. There may be a lot of discussion before we start to see a style emerging. But that's not to say the project is heading into a slow death by eternal committee: there is a timeline, and there are even construction plans set in stone, if not environmentally unfriendly concrete. That "broad participatory co-creation process" will only last until summer 2021, with "delivery" starting in the second half of 2021. Intriguingly, the Commission mentions "the setting up of a network of five founding Bauhaus[es] in 2022." With further expansion possible: "In a second wave, further Bauhaus[es] can be added across the EU and even globally."At this point, the New Bauhaus steps off the drawing board and into the real world. It is described as "a forum for discussion, a space for art and culture, an experimentation lab, an accelerator, a hub for global networks and experts, a contact point for citizens interested in the topic."It seems that the new-Bauhaus idea is not simply a useful branding tool â a quick comparison to a well-known previous conceptual movement â but a reference to an actual building, or buildings. And that's entirely fitting for the heritage of the name. Unlike, say, Art Nouveau or Futurism, the original Bauhaus was literally a school: an art school, founded in Weimar in the aftermath of a world-shaking event.  The old BauhausThat Bauhaus (German for "building house") is now identified as a minimalist style is somewhat ironic given the widespread aims of its founders. Although it was founded by architect Walter Gropius â a year after the end of World War I in 1919 â the Staatliches Bauhaus art school always combined fine arts with crafts and espoused a Gesamtkunstwerk ("comprehensive artwork"), a common aesthetic that intended to unify all the arts. Indeed, Bauhaus output would eventually span architecture, graphic design, interior design, art, typography and industrial design â the latter being entirely fitting for a theory that attempted to marry individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production revolutionizing capitalism. As with the EU's Green Deal, these were high ideals applied to necessary situations. As Gropius put it, "An object is defined by its nature. In order, then, to design it to function correctly â a container, a chair, or a house â one must first of all study its nature: For it must serve its purpose perfectly, that is, it must fulfil its function usefully, be durable, economical, and 'beautiful.'"  That last word perhaps referenced William Morris, the 19th-century English designer whose golden rule was "Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful." For Bauhaus, there was no need to decide between beauty and use, between function and form: the everyday could be rendered sublime through the right marriage of utility and appearance, usually stripped down and presented without artifice.Widely popular across Europe and the world, Bauhaus design was eventually reflected in everything from Wassily chairs to Olivetti typewriters and, most lastingly, Modernist architecture. That the EU has evoked its name is perhaps designed to recall a brief time when the whole continent was united in the thrilling possibilities of a sleek new future with more opportunity than threat. There is, however, a sad end to the Bauhaus tale. In 1933, by which time it had relocated to Berlin, the Bauhaus was closed down by the newly elected Nazi party, for which it represented cosmopolitanism, liberalism and degeneracy. The Nazis had a very different aesthetic, a more traditional and reactionary Romanticist throwback to an illusory golden age. Adolf Hitler encouraged his favored architect Albert Speer to concoct designs for the reconstruction of Berlin as a New Rome, an aesthetically illiterate toy box of domes and triumphal arches, which was never to see the light of day. History proves that not every overarching architectural plan is well received or even well conceived. But in throwing open its doors to the best of new ideas, hopefully the EU's new Bauhaus will help to future-proof the continent's building stock for our new millennium â while putting in place ecological targets to make sure it isn't our last.Grand architectural plans are not always viewed well by history.

But in throwing open its doors to the best of new ideas, hopefully the EU's new Bauhaus will help to future-proof the continent's building stock for our new millennium â while putting in place ecological targets to make sure it isn't our last.You may know KFC. You may know Luosifen (stinky sour snail noodles). But you may have never imagined KFC will sell Luosifen someday.KFC China has announced the launch of a range of pre-packaged, fast-cooking items categorized as "Kaifengcai," which include chicken Luosifen, chicken breast and chicken soup.Starting October 12, KFC stores in 23 Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, have been selling chicken breast and chicken soup, while chicken Luosifen won't be available until October 26.According to KFC China, the "Kaifengcai" series is only designed for take-away and not dine-in. It's aimed at "inviting young people to enjoy hands-on cooking pleasure" via dishes' self-heating packaging, according to the KFC announcement.Originating in Liuzhou, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in the 1970s, Luosifen served as a cheap street snack that people outside of the city knew little about. It was not until 2012 when a hit Chinese food documentary, "A Bite of China," featured it and it became a household name.Combining the elements of dishes made by Han people with those of the Miao and Dong ethnic groups, Luosifen comprises rice noodles boiled with pickled bamboo shoots, dried turnip, fresh vegetables and peanuts in spicy river snail soup. It is sour, spicy, salty, hot and stinky after being boiled.There's been a "fever of Luosifen" in the catering industry in recent years, both inside and outside of China. Many food manufacturers have launched products with Luosifen flavor, such as mooncake and hotpot.Meanwhile, Luosifen worth around 7.5 million yuan (about $1.1 million) was exported from Liuzhou from January to June this year. That's eight times the total export value in 2019.KFC's move marks its latest step in the localization of its menus in China."As a leading fast-food chain, KFC is really quick in making products catering to local flavors. Luosifen is one of the most popular foods among young Chinese people. The KFC certainly hopes to attract more customers through this move," said Zhu Danpeng, an analyst in the Chinese food industry.You may know KFC. You may know Luosifen (stinky sour snail noodles).

earth around 150 million years ago was sold at a Paris auction house on Tuesday for 3 million euros ($3.52 million).The skeleton of the Allosaurus dinosaur, dug up in the U.S. state of Wyoming three years ago, went to an unnamed foreign buyer for well in excess of the 1 million euro starting price."This is a high grade specimen," said Iacopo Briano, a palaeontologist who acted as a consultant to the Binoche et Giquello auction house which conducted the sale.The specimen is unusual because it is so complete: around 70 percent of the bones are present, and they were found aligned with each other, making it easier to reconnect them during the restoration process.The restored skeleton stands 3.5 meters (11 feet) high and 10 meters long. The ribcage bears the marks of what the auctioneers said may have been an attack by a rival Allosaurus or a predator.(Cover: A skeleton of an Allosaurus dinosaur is on display at Drouot auction house on October 12, 2020, in Paris, France. /CFP)The

Thursday, as investors scrambled for a piece of the country's largest listing in three years.The IPO price was set at 135,000 won ($118) and hit the Kospi exchange daily limit of 351,000 won within minutes into the stock open.It had a market capitalization of 10 trillion won ($8.7 billion) putting it among South Korea's top 40 most valuable companies.The listing helps revive the country's IPO activity this year after two subdued years, with volumes rising 51 percent to $2.9 billion so far this year, compared with the same period last year, according to Refinitiv data.The Big Hit float also made the seven members of BTS instant multimillionaires with each granted shares worth 18.5 billion won ($16 million) at the debut price.The Billboard Chart topping group, which has a huge global following, accounted for 87.7 percent of the label's revenue in the first half of 2020, according to a regulatory filing.Analysts say the company has proved itself extremely online savvy, using YouTube and social media for market infiltration since in-person performances were canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic.BTS' first paid online concert in June earned a Guinness World Records

He was 95.His family confirmed Wednesday that Kretzmer died after a long illness with Parkinson's disease at the London home he shared with his second wife, Sybil Sever.Tributes poured in from giants of the London stage, including theatrical producer Cameron Mackintosh, singer Elaine Paige and lyricist Tim Rice."Les Miserables" producer Mackintosh said Kretzmer was instrumental in bringing Victor Hugo's classic tale of defiance and redemption in early 19th century France to the stage in English in October 1985, five years after it had opened in Paris."His wonderful words for Les MisÃ©rables will live on in his memory forever more," he said in a statement.Paying tribute online, lyricist Sir Tim Rice described Kretzmer as a "great lyricist and man of theatre" and "a giant of his trade," adding: "RIP Herbie," while for Paige, he was a "masterful wordsmith."Kretzmer, known as Herbie to his friends, was born in Kroonstad, a small town south of Johannesburg, South Africa, in October 1925. He was one of four sons of Jewish-Lithuanian immigrants who ran a grocery shop and later a prosperous furniture store.From Johannesburg, he moved to Paris in 1953, playing the piano by night in a bar in return for a meal.

He also answered questions on creativity in filmmaking from the press.What do you think of the impact of the pandemic on filmmakers?I believe that some filmmakers will pay attention to public health topics in the future. The pandemic has an impact on all aspects of our lives, not just filmmaking. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, I felt that I and the people around me were very healthy, but now that we are so vulnerable with the pandemic, I hope that with the advancement of science and technology, we can better deal with the pandemic.Most of your movies are related to daily life, does this have anything to do with your perspective on the world?When I recall things in life, there may be some things that are repetitive, not so attractive to put in movies. Sometimes when a small crisis occurs, it will be meaningful to transform it into a movie theme.For example, two people are having dinner in a restaurant and chatting. This is very daily and not interesting to put into a movie. But for example, these two people are a couple and are about to divorce. And this is the last dinner before the divorce. That would be something dramatic enough to put into a movie. It is different from an ordinary dinner, and can convey a meaning.What is your general creative process?I usually have an idea in my mind. It might be a picture or a fragment that appears in my mind. Many times I start with a very small idea. It might stay in my mind for a long time. Some ideas are constantly changing and maturing. If I think these ideas or fragments are suitable for film expression, I will enrich them and turn them into movies. For example, this idea is related to social concerns, can reflect some social problems, and psychologically caters to the needs of the audience, I will turn it into a movie. But some ideas may only have meaning from one angle, and I will not turn this idea into a movie. When creating a screenplay, I will first describe the outline of the story, and I will gradually enrich it during the creation. In the beginning, I would not imagine the end of the film, the screenplay creation would take a long time, I wouldn't start filming before the screenplay is matured. For example, I have an idea of a young man traveling to northern Iran, he might meet a lot of people, and many things might happen. At the beginning, I would not specifically imagine what things would happen, and who is he going to encounter. I would enrich these when writing the screenplay.What is realistic cinema?The word realistic itself has very rich meanings. Some movies are called realistic movies, which are just superficially realistic, not actually realistic. After I worked in the film industry for a while, my understanding of realistic cinema is to pay attention to people's daily lives. This is realistic cinema. I discussed this with directors in China before, for example, a friend of yours called you and said that he hadnât seen you for a long time and wanted to have tea with you. You were very happy when you received the call and you guys chatted over tea happily, he said that he wanted to start a journey. This is daily life, there is no conflict or contradiction, this is not a movie story. But for example, letâs say this friend died suddenly in a car accident during the trip, elements for a movie came into being. We need to find usable fragments from our lives and make artistic creations.You have experiences directing in French and Spanish. How do you master foreign language creation?In my films, I try to show life in Iran as much as possible. Creating films in Persian, expressing the problems of our society is simpler. If I go to other countries, my habits are different, languages are different, and social environments are different. I have made two films abroad but I still feel that art films are closely integrated with society and culture. When I create films for my own country and for my own audience, the job is simpler. In other countries, there might be creative difficulties.How do you deal with the difference between director and audience's perspective over a movie?These two perspectives are difficult to separate. As film directors, we always think about the audiences. Actually, we are the first audiences of our own films. I don't judge in movies, I just convey. For example, in The Past, we have two protagonists, an Iranian and a French. I am an Iranian. In my creation, some of my emotions are closer to the Iranian role. I know how he would think. But for the French, it is not that close. But in the creation of the screenplay, I try not to favor anyone, and do not judge anyone's behavior. The audience should be the one to judge. I will not give audiences my judgment during the filming.How do you balance the commercial success of a film and the pursuit of artistic expression? Movies need to have commercial success on the one hand, and the pursuit of artistic expression on the other. Many artistic films are not liked by the audiences, unfortunately. In many cases, the audiences and the professional film critics are not the same group. Some of my own films are fortunately welcomed by the audiences. I think there are two reasons: one is drama and the other is reality. Both of these can make a film interesting and attractive.Some artistic films have weak plot connections, and the director needs to connect the plots in a realistic narrative so that the audience can relate to their lives in order to attract them. Plots are like pearls in the ocean, we need to string them well to make it work. Arrange them randomly would make the audience feel that these things cannot happen in their daily life, so they won't like them. Expressing life and be full of drama, at the same time, can attract ordinary audiences. And only with dramatic plots that reflect social issues can we achieve artistic success.Asghar Farhadi was born in 1972 in Iran. He became interested in cinema when he was a teenager and started his education in filmmaking by joining the Youth Cinema Society of Esfahan in 1986, where he made 8mm and 16mm short films.

It got critical acclaim inside and outside Iran. Roger Ebert called it "the best picture of the year," and it received both the Golden Bear and the Silver Bear for Best Actor and Best Actress at the Berlin International Film Festival.

Lead actress Berenice Bejo won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival. "The Past"  was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the Best Foreign Language Film and won the National Board of Reviews' Best Foreign Language Film award. The film was also nominated in five categories of the Cesar Film Festival, including Directing, Best Script and Best Actress. His 2016 movie, "The Salesman," won the Best Screenplay Award at the 69th Cannes Film Festival and brought home the second Oscar for Iran in the Best Foreign Language Film category. Two-time Oscar-winning Iranian director Asghar Farhadi shared his knowledge with young Chinese directors in an online masterclass during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF), focusing on realistic cinema in his creative works.

But for example, letâs say this friend died suddenly in a car accident during the trip, elements for a movie came into being. We need to find usable fragments from our lives and make artistic creations.You have experiences directing in French and Spanish. How do you master foreign language creation?In my films, I try to show life in Iran as much as possible. Creating films in Persian, expressing the problems of our society is simpler. If I go to other countries, my habits are different, languages are different, and social environments are different. I have made two films abroad but I still feel that art films are closely integrated with society and culture. When I create films for my own country and for my own audience, the job is simpler. In other countries, there might be creative difficulties.How do you deal with the difference between director and audience's perspective over a movie?These two perspectives are difficult to separate. As film directors, we always think about the audiences. Actually, we are the first audiences of our own films. I don't judge in movies, I just convey. For example, in The Past, we have two protagonists, an Iranian and a French. I am an Iranian. In my creation, some of my emotions are closer to the Iranian role. I know how he would think. But for the French, it is not that close. But in the creation of the screenplay, I try not to favor anyone, and do not judge anyone's behavior. The audience should be the one to judge. I will not give audiences my judgment during the filming.How do you balance the commercial success of a film and the pursuit of artistic expression? Movies need to have commercial success on the one hand, and the pursuit of artistic expression on the other. Many artistic films are not liked by the audiences, unfortunately. In many cases, the audiences and the professional film critics are not the same group. Some of my own films are fortunately welcomed by the audiences. I think there are two reasons: one is drama and the other is reality. Both of these can make a film interesting and attractive.Some artistic films have weak plot connections, and the director needs to connect the plots in a realistic narrative so that the audience can relate to their lives in order to attract them. Plots are like pearls in the ocean, we need to string them well to make it work. Arrange them randomly would make the audience feel that these things cannot happen in their daily life, so they won't like them. Expressing life and be full of drama, at the same time, can attract ordinary audiences. And only with dramatic plots that reflect social issues can we achieve artistic success.Asghar Farhadi was born in 1972 in Iran.

An exhibition in Beijing unravels its mystery and history.These are eye-witnesses of the evolution of Chinese civilization from the third to the ninth century. Rather than curated by chronology or geography, the 200 or so ceramic objects are arranged into four subjects: Anchoret, Sutra, Alchemy and Lions. Each concept represents a significant cultural, social or historical aspect of the period."Anchoret" refers to powerful and influential families who had for generations held important official positions in the Wei, Jin and Northern and Southern dynasties. At the beginning of the third century, the scholar-officer clan, who failed in its pursuit of the official career, grew skeptical of Confucian ethics. "They began pursuing a more philosophical, seclusive way of living, advocating for individual liberation and spiritual freedom.

The trend for colored stones has increased as an asset class by the super rich in recent years.Mined by Russian diamond producer Alrosa, the 14.83-carat diamond was cut from the largest pink crystal ever found in Russia, Sotheby's said."The occurrence of pink diamonds in nature is extremely rare in any size. Only one percent of all pink diamonds are larger than 10-carats," said Gary Schuler, worldwide chairman of Sotheby's jewelry division.Naturally colored diamonds occur because they posses a particular lattice structure that refracts light to produce colored, rather than white, stones.Pink diamonds are both rare and aesthetically highly prized by collectors, analysts say.The gem is being shown in Singapore and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan region before being auctioned in Geneva on November 11.An extremely rare, vivid purple-pink diamond mined in Russia is expected to fetch up to $38 million when it goes under the hammer on November 11, the auction house Sotheby's said on Monday.The oval gem, which is named after the Russian ballet "The Spirit of the Rose," is the largest of its kind to be offered at auction.

Adapted from real events and told through the lens of volleyball legend Lang Ping, it offers a unique glimpse into some of the contentious issues that have compounded her complicated legacy.And therein lies the novelty."'Leap' is distinguished from other patriotic movies in the way that it treats characters in a rather refreshing way while injecting the story with fresh narratives and far-reaching hints," Jing, a movie reviewer who runs his own review website, told CGTN.In recent years, China's entertainment industry has been flooded with movies featuring historical events effusing patriotic sentiments. Making billions in box-office revenues, these movies are beloved by Chinese cinema-goers.While some of these are repetitive, they serve a purpose. "We do need these movies to convey some messages," said Li Jing, another freelance movie reviewer.But "stories need to be told in a way that characters are fully formed," Li explained. "'Leap' is not perfect, but it shows the effort of focusing the narrative on an intricate character."A standard Chinese patriotic movie tends to emphasize individual sacrifices for the collective, but "Leap" did not follow that path, according to Jing. "I believe Peter Ho-sun Chan, the movie director, was more keen on examining the reconciliation between individual fulfillment and collective interests. It transcends the idea that war-time blockbusters are the only type of movies that audiences like."Lang was an indefatigable player in the national women's team when China was just opening up to the outside world in the 1980s. At a time when patriotism was running high and winning sports events on the global stage signified tremendous national pride, Lang and her team secured thrilling victories â including a world championship title and Olympic gold â that still reverberate across the country.After taking up a coaching career in the U.S. and successfully guiding the U.S. national team to notable victories, she returned to China and was determined to lead the struggling Chinese national team back to its peak. But by then, she was no longer just a patriot elated by winning glory for her country, but had become a seasoned, reserved coach accustomed to both victory or defeat.And "Leap" touches on the contentious theme underlying that change: her questioning of China's sports system, where top athletes are required to devote all their energy to their sport but are not prepared for life after their career is over."'Leap' not only acknowledges the fading trend of patriotism in contemporary China, a cause for the loss of spirit that once motivated athletes of older generations, but also hints at Lang's change in attitude towards volleyball as well as the drawbacks of China's sports system," Jing said. "In this respect, Chan approaches these topics with full honesty."Lang suffered permanent injuries due to strenuous training in her early career as an athlete. Even now, she still holds a disability certificate in the U.S.. But before she left China for an overseas coaching career, she was allegedly refused reimbursement for some costly medical bills by the Chinese volleyball association."Chan is very adept at presenting individualism as the product of our time. One of his signature movies in the 1990s, 'Comrades: Almost a Love Story,' depicts a woman who puts her self-interest above others," said Li."In 'Leap,' we can see the unraveling of the same discussion.

One of his principles for filmmaking, as he himself has stated, is "not to give up on making movies that push the boundaries, as long as they don't cross the line."These directors are feeding new blood into China's movie industry.From silver-haired old men to children who just learnt how to speak, people of the Nu ethnic group can sing and dance, and almost all of them are quite talented.

Van Fleet Award, an award celebrating U.S.-Korea relations."We will always remember the history of pain that our two nations shared together and the sacrifices of countless men and women," said the team leader of BTS after receiving the award, referring to the U.S. and South Korea. Many Chinese netizens pointed out that the speech plays up to U.S. netizens, despite the fact that the country played the role of aggressor in the war.Some Chinese fans declared they would stop chasing the K-pop group. According to Reuters, one netizen said on the social media, referring to BTS, "They should not make any money from China.""There were thousands of Chinese soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the war. You are South Korean people and you can say that, but I am Chinese so I decided to be angry and quit the boy band's fan club to express my strong attitude," one BTS fan surnamed Li told Global Times on Sina Weibo on Sunday.It has also led to a change in the way some companies advertise their products in China.Users on popular Chinese e-commerce platform JD.com on Sunday found that BTS-edition smartphone and earphones disappeared from Samsung's official store on the e-commerce platform. However, according to Global Times, a staff member from the store's pre-sales services said that the products are no longer in stock.The same products also disappeared from Samsung's official store on Tmall, another popular e-commerce platform in China.Some netizens on China's Twitter-like platform Sina Weibo applauded the move, with one user commenting "it proves Samsung cares about the Chinese market."Italian sports brand FILA also deleted a promotion post by the band on its Sina Weibo account.In response, China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday that it had taken note of the related reports, as well as some feedback and comments from Chinese netizens, adding that "looking forward to the future, cherishing peace and promoting friendship should be our common pursuit and worthy of our joint efforts."This year marks the 70th anniversary of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-53), also known as the Korean War, with a great number of Chinese people commemorating those who sacrificed their lives during the war.A series of remembrance events were held in recent days with media reporting on October 10 that the Memorial Hall of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea in China's border city of Dandong, northeast China's Liaoning Province, had been reopened after renovation.As of press time, the band's management company, Big Hit Entertainment, did not immediately respond.(With input from Global Times, Reuters)(Cover image via CFP)South Korean boyband BTS is facing a barrage of criticism on China's social media after its leader made remarks about the Korean War leading several big-name brands, including Samsung, to apparently distance themselves from the K-pop group in the Chinese market.The leader of BTS, known by the initials RM, upset many people in China with a speech when the band received the General James A.

In 2015, China established the Girls' and Women's Education Award with UNESCO, and Peng mentioned that there are millions of people who devote their life for the education of girls and women in China.  Zhang Guimei is one of them. She is a female teacher who has taught in the poor mountainous areas of Southwest China's Yunnan Province for over 40 years. She established the first full-tuition-free girl high school in China, which helps many young girls from poverty-stricken families receive education. This year, 1.5 billion students have been forced to suspend classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Peng, and this impact on girls is particularly pronounced. We need to find ways to help those girls get back to school so that they won't be left behind due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sixty-three percent of illiterate adults around the world are women, said Peng, and the education of girls and women is of great benefit to the present and the future. China will continue to work with UNESCO to ensure the success of the Girls' and Women's Education Awards from 2021 to 2025, and make greater contributions to promoting girls' and women's education and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, Peng added. Audrey Azoulay, director-general of UNESCO, thanked the Chinese government for supporting the establishment of Girls' and Women's Education Awards. The UNESCO Prize for Girls' and Women's Education honors outstanding and innovative contributions made by individuals, institutions and organizations to advance girls' and women's education. China's First Lady Peng Liyuan, also United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) special envoy for the advancement of girls' and women's education, sent a congratulatory message to the award of UNESCO via a video on October 12. In her message, Peng expressed congratulations to prize-winners from Sri Lanka and Kenya.

Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home. Jason Huth, an English teacher in Beijing, was one who decided not to travel during the holiday. "I chose to stay for a few reasons; partly because I had just got back to Beijing a few weeks ago after being stuck abroad since Chinese New Year, partly because my school strongly advised teachers not to travel too far away from Beijing due to fears of having to quarantine upon return."Many international schools and companies advised staff against travel during the break. Aletta Magrieta Strauss, a Beijing-based art teacher, said she thought this was reasonable. "If there was an outbreak and I had to quarantine as a result, work would not cover the cost. They (international schools) have already lost a lot of money and are still trying to get staff back into China."With many people having extra money to spend due to not traveling earlier in the year, and with the onus being on safety and comfort, high-end hotels saw a boom in business. Of all hotel bookings made on Trip.com during the October holiday, four- and five-star accommodation accounted for nearly half. It's anticipated that the effect will be lasting, as more people get used to the idea of "luxury staycations."This year's October holiday saw a resurgence in domestic tourism, with 637 million trips being recorded in eight days.

Soprano Zhang Liping and baritone He Leiming, both natives of Wuhan, sang with the Chorus of the Wuhan Conservatory of Music and Beijing Music Association Chorus.Earlier this year, the people of Wuhan and of the rest of China fought the coronavirus pandemic with solidarity and eventually won the battle. "We need to remember this time, reflect the disaster, respect lives and honor civilization," said Zou Ye, who composed the eight-movement symphony."'Dedicated to 2020' is the first large-scale (symphony) work paying tribute to the fight against the coronavirus epidemic," said Yu Long, chairman of the Beijing Music Festival Art Committee."The musicians of the Wuhan Philharmonic Orchestra were engaged in non-musical community work during the epidemic. Each musician is like a soldier. Musicians turn musical instruments into weapons on the stage and provide spiritual support for people. They were also soldiers fighting on the front line of the epidemic," he added.Beijing Music Festival hits both offline and onlineUnder the theme "The Music Must Go On," the Beijing Music Festival is offering 20 offline performances and 240 hours of non-stop online audio and video programs through the mobile application BMF Club.This year marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven and to commemorate the musician, 10 young award-winning violinists, including Xie Haoming, Chen Yige and Jiang Yiliang, have been invited to present 10 of Beethoven's violin sonatas on stage from October 12 to 14.The online offerings, a new addition in the wake of the pandemic, include over 2,000 pieces of music as well as specially-made programs.On each of the festival's 10 nights, the program "Nessun dorma" will invite a Chinese opera singer to introduce some great operas spanning from the Baroque period to the 21st century.

Let art and artists get the respect they deserve," he added.The festival will close on October 20 with a concert themed "We Were Born in 2000" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the China Philharmonic Orchestra.

The most dominant is a group called the Han, who make up more than 90 percent of the mainland's population.Traditionally, the Han people had their own distinctive way of life, including the way they dressed. The type of clothing they wear is known as Hanfu, but some also call it Han clothing. The traditional clothing system of Han people is today divided into two phases: ancient and modern.Ancient Hanfu dates back to the time of Yellow Emperor, which is about 4,000 years ago. It had been developing until about 300 or 400 years ago, when the Qing Dynasty's policy on hair and dress code intervened.Later on, it was around the beginning of the 20th century when the country started moving more towards Western-style clothing. Moving forward, modern Hanfu styles refer to outfits that inherit the basic designs of Hanfu, along with more modern elements.These eight words sum up its characteristics and what makes a Hanfu. In Chinese, it says "Ping Zhong Jiao You, Kuan Tuan He Ying."Ping means flat. One of the key elements of Hanfu is that it doesn't have shoulder lines, meaning the outfit uses just one plain cut of fabric.Zhong means centralized. The cutting and tailoring abide by the rule of symmetrical tailoring and stitching.Jiao means the elements of Hanfu are designed to cross and overlap, upholding a belief in traditional Chinese culture: the balance of Yin and Yang.The word "You" is stressed, meaning everything must move to the right, including how the front is closed.The fifth one is Kuan, meaning width. Hanfu outfits have loose-fitting upper sleeves and bottom. It reminds the wearer to walk with grace and to observe etiquettes.Tuan and He refer to the edges and sleeves. The edges have to be neat and clean with no dangling threads, while the sleeves should come together and meet.Last, but not least is the embellishment.

The elderly want to live at home. However, while their children are willing to take care of them, they suffer from lack of time and energy. Virtual nursing homes seem to be providing a solution to the problem.With just one phone call, the nursing home can provide various services for the elderly at home, from buying vegetables and cooking to cleaning, from massage services to accompanying the sick, so that the elderly can enjoy "personal customized elderly care" without leaving home. In the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, there is not a single bed, but it can serve tens of thousands of elderly people.An "information and home care service" platform and an "intelligent elderly care informatization" management platform have been created to incorporate registered elderly people, regardless of their location, according to Qin Tiantian, director of the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District. The system can provide professional and standardized home care services in a timely and accurate manner through big data collection."Although virtual nursing homes are virtual, the services are actually in place," said Qin. "As of now, more than 133,700 elderly people have been registered and hospitalized, and the total number of services has reached 13.79 million.""The combination of internet technology and elderly care services can not only update offline service maps, day care center monitoring and other content in real time, but also retrieve long-term monitoring data such as blood glucose and blood pressure of the elderly," said Liu Mingzhe, a technical engineer at the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District, adding that smart devices such as infrared sensors and voice-activated alarms can also realize "cloud monitoring" for the elderly in their virtual nursing homes."Different from traditional nursing homes, virtual nursing homes are an old-age care service platform built on information technology," said Pan Helin, professor at the Digital Economy Research Institute of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, further pointing out that virtual nursing homes are generally led by the government and integrate nursing institutions and communities."Elderly care resources such as medical service centers and housekeeping services provide various professional services for the elderly through remote diagnosis and treatment and home-based services," he added.The emergence of virtual nursing homes is a result of adapting to the country's social needs â a high degree of population aging and a stage of rapid development. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 2018, China's population of elderly people over 60 years old reached 249 million, accounting for 17.9 percent of the total population, and the pension situation is relatively severe."The comparative advantages of developing virtual nursing homes are very obvious. It can realize the centralized, precise and efficient supply of decentralized nursing resources, which is an effective choice for my country to deal with the impact of population aging," Pan said.Virtual nursing homes are not unexpected. As early as 2007, China's first virtual nursing home care service center was born in Gusu District, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. It mainly provides home-based care services for the elderly, especially empty nesters and the destitute. Today, after more than 10 years of development, Suzhou has formed a mature virtual pension model, which has been replicated and promoted throughout Jiangsu.In recent years, some places are also exploring different forms of virtual nursing homes. For example, Shanghai has vigorously developed an "embedded" elderly care system, creating a "15-minute home elderly care service circle" in urban areas, and launched new types of community elderly care institutions."Virtual nursing homes are all new things in the international arena, lacking mature experience reference, and relying more on our own exploration," Pan said."Current virtual nursing homes are also facing excessive reliance on government purchases, insufficient market activity, and shortage of talents. The bottleneck is that the construction of virtual nursing homes has a long way to go from one to many and from many to excellent," he added.Pan believes that it is necessary to improve relevant laws and regulations, standardize the development of the industry, strengthen the supervision of this new business format, and at the same time, under the principle of inclusiveness and prudence, enhance the tolerance of related enterprises and promote the development of the industry.Some other experts also mentioned that the key difference between virtual nursing homes and general housekeeping services lies in their professionalism and orientation. It is recommended to speed up the training of compound talents with skills in geriatrics, rehabilitation, nursing, psychology, and management, and expand the career development space of senior care service professionals.As the degree of population aging deepens, "virtual nursing homes" â a new model of home care that makes full use of social resources â are becoming the choice of more and more elderly people in China.The Chinese National Development and Reform Commission and 22 other departments jointly issued the "Implementation Opinions on Promoting Capacity Expansion and Quality Improvement of Consumption and Accelerating the Formation of a Strong Domestic Market" on March 13, 2020, proposing to vigorously develop the "internet + social services" consumption model and support the development of community-based virtual nursing homes.Over the past 10 years, virtual nursing homes have been promoted in many places in the country, exhibiting expanding service groups, diversified service content, and prominent intelligent features.

"We had expected to pay tribute to the booming 1920s in the film history and the birth of experimental film through the Pingyao International Film Festival after 100 years," said Jia Zhangke, Chinese film director and the festival's founder, recalling his last year's plan for this year's festival.But the plan was disrupted, as China's film industry was forced to shut down for 178 days due to the coronavirus pandemic. "As an international film festival held after the epidemic, we want to give a film's answer to the public health event," said Jia, "The festival is a manifestation that Chinese film industry workers insist on producing good works despite all odds and having dialogue with the world."That's how the theme of this year's festival, "Only Filmâ¦" comes. Just as it puts on the festival's official website, "Only films can make the darkness bright."Reduced size but high standard remainedAlthough with a reduced size, more than 50 films will be screened in the festival's five sections. Among them, 43 percent are for the world premiere, 89 percent for the Asian premiere, and all of them for the national premiere.The opening film "This is Life" is an anthology of a number of short videos, many of which are filmed by common people about their lives via their phones. The special presentation "So Far So Close," produced by Chinese director Zhang Yang, tells the story of a food deliveryman during the epidemic.The official selection section Crouching Tigers, which presents international directorial debuts or second features, includes "The Whale Boy," winner of the GdA Director's Award at the 17th edition of Venice's Giornate degli Autori, and "Residue," winner of the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Slamdance Film Festival.Section Hidden Dragons, focusing on Chinese emerging talents, has "An Insignificant Affair," winner of the White Mulberry Award for Best First-time Director at the 22nd Far East Film Festival.Presenting films by renowned directors or films in a spotlight, the section Galas includes the opening film of the 77th Venice Film Festival "The TiesLacci," and "The Women Who Ran" and "Hidden Away," which won the Silver Bear for Best Director and the Silver Bear for Best Actor respectively at the 70th Berlin Film Festival.Other sections collect nine films made in Shanxi, and nine films of the Serbian New Wave produced from the 1960s to 1970s in Yugoslavia's era.Since many international film festivals canceled this year, a section used to present the award-winning films of the year was cut off. Instead, more films produced by new talents have been added into Crouching Tigers and Hidden Dragons sections."Under the current situation, we hope to maintain the core competitiveness of the Pingyao International Film Festival, and promotes its core value in helping young directors to develop," said Jia.One thing to notice is that the over 1,000 film-making projects are seeking for promotion this year, twice than the number of the previous year. "It reflects that because of coronavirus, fewer films were filmed outdoor, but more screenplays and programs were written at home," said Jia.The festival, therefore, decided to increase the number of projects to be promoted. "Like other film festivals, the Pingyao International Film Festival experienced the puzzles brought by the pandemic, but we found our own solution," he said.The Pingyao International Film Festival encourages dialogue between non-Western (Chinese, Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, and African) and Western film communities, and fosters communication and collaboration between Chinese and international filmmakers.The 4th Pingyao International Film Festival kicks off in the ancient city of Pingyao, north China's Shanxi Province on Saturday, providing a non-Western film industry's answer to the world in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.This year marks the 125th anniversary of the birth of film.

The special presentation "So Far So Close," produced by Chinese director Zhang Yang, tells the story of a food deliveryman during the epidemic.The official selection section Crouching Tigers, which presents international directorial debuts or second features, includes "The Whale Boy," winner of the GdA Director's Award at the 17th edition of Venice's Giornate degli Autori, and "Residue," winner of the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Slamdance Film Festival.Section Hidden Dragons, focusing on Chinese emerging talents, has "An Insignificant Affair," winner of the White Mulberry Award for Best First-time Director at the 22nd Far East Film Festival.Presenting films by renowned directors or films in a spotlight, the section Galas includes the opening film of the 77th Venice Film Festival "The TiesLacci," and "The Women Who Ran" and "Hidden Away," which won the Silver Bear for Best Director and the Silver Bear for Best Actor respectively at the 70th Berlin Film Festival.Other sections collect nine films made in Shanxi, and nine films of the Serbian New Wave produced from the 1960s to 1970s in Yugoslavia's era.Since many international film festivals canceled this year, a section used to present the award-winning films of the year was cut off. Instead, more films produced by new talents have been added into Crouching Tigers and Hidden Dragons sections."Under the current situation, we hope to maintain the core competitiveness of the Pingyao International Film Festival, and promotes its core value in helping young directors to develop," said Jia.One thing to notice is that the over 1,000 film-making projects are seeking for promotion this year, twice than the number of the previous year. "It reflects that because of coronavirus, fewer films were filmed outdoor, but more screenplays and programs were written at home," said Jia.The festival, therefore, decided to increase the number of projects to be promoted. "Like other film festivals, the Pingyao International Film Festival experienced the puzzles brought by the pandemic, but we found our own solution," he said.The Pingyao International Film Festival encourages dialogue between non-Western (Chinese, Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, and African) and Western film communities, and fosters communication and collaboration between Chinese and international filmmakers.Art lovers can now catch up on the latest pieces created by Chinese and British artists during quarantine in the comfort of their own homes, for instance, to see the ballet "Swan Lake" performed by world-class dancers in bathtubs.The British Council has spearheaded an initiative called "#ConnectedByCreativity" with the ongoing 2020 UK-China Contemporary Culture Festival launched on October 1. The first edition, running through October 21, showcases a glittering cluster of cultural and art works by artists and institutions from both countries as well as collaborations.More than 75 cultural performances and programs of different kinds, ranging from music, theater, dance, film, fashion, literature, architecture and visual art to industry insight events are being shown in cyberspace during the three-week-long festival. Some will be unveiled to the public for the first time.About 50 cultural institutions from the two countries, such as the London-based British Library, Science Museum Group, Tate Modern, and Victoria and Albert Museum, as well as China's Times Museum, have provided a variety of digital content, most of which was created in the time of COVID-19 lockdowns.Noting that the pandemic "impact has been significant" for the cultural and creative industries, Rehana Mughal, arts director for the British Council in China, said that "many artists have found imaginative ways to make powerful work that documents our collective strength during this challenging time." "While people are at home, they're still being able to engage with new forms of culture also made in the lockdown situation," Mughal told CGTN in a previous interview. She believes that the project will also contribute to "the important cultural and educational relationship between two countries."It is the largest ever digital festival of Chinese and UK creativity to have taken place through the British Council, according to Matt Burney, director of British Council China.The British international organization for education and culture partnered with the Department for International Trade of the UK and China's Chengdu Foreign Affairs Office to launch the online China-UK Contemporary Culture Festival, the first of its kind that is dedicated to cultural and creative exchanges between the countries.The festival celebrates the power of arts and culture in connecting people via introducing new artworks to wider audiences in China and the UK, aiming to help strengthen collaboration between artists and cultural institutions from the two countries as they are struggling to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Mughal noted that through the digital project #ConnectedByCreativity, they sought to overcome the challenges artists, institutions and audiences face in connecting to one another at times of social distancing and travel restrictions. "We wanted to ensure we were able to support connection and build trust despite not being in the same room," she added."Adversity can sometimes breed creativity. We felt it was important to mark this moment in history and to share art that has been produced during a pandemic," she said, adding that the online festival would help expand the reach of the art to new audiences from both countries.According to the Council, the event opened earlier on the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, with the main focus on promoting the works from Chinese artists and institutions in the UK. Since Friday, more performances, dialogues and other programs from the UK have been presented online to Chinese audiences.One of the festival's highlights is a collaborative program called "Distant Dialogue," featuring musicians from China and the UK and allowing "followers to come up with ideas to inspire these musicians to make new music," said Burney.Despite physical distancing, he believes from the online communities they are building will come new and inspirational music.The festival also features eye-catching collaborations between artists from two countries, such as acclaimed choreographic production "Samsara" by renowned dancers Aakash Odedra (UK) and Hu Shenyuan (China)."For those people that don't know where to start, it's a very good introduction," said Mughal.(Cover and infographic images designed by Du Chenxin)Art lovers can now catch up on the latest pieces created by Chinese and British artists during quarantine in the comfort of their own homes, for instance, to see the ballet "Swan Lake" performed by world-class dancers in bathtubs.The British Council has spearheaded an initiative called "#ConnectedByCreativity" with the ongoing 2020 UK-China Contemporary Culture Festival launched on October 1.

From all-round scandals to plot-twists, this is an almost unscripted real-life TV show. And this year, drama is being served daily.Train-wreck debates, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the following nomination debacle, President Trump getting, unsurprisingly, infected with COVID-19, and news of his $750 taxes are just examples of how these elections can be tragically juicy. Still, if you have time, disposition, and are curious about the world of American politics and some of the issues that are central in this year's cycle, we leave you some suggestions for the weekend.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionThe Circus: Inside the craziest political campaign on earthThis Showtime series with five seasons is a must. Starting in 2016 with the Primaries and following election, the show is running until today, giving an extraordinary account of the campaign and political world in the U.S. Featuring exclusive interviews and analyses by the show hosts, strategist Mark Mckinnon, and reporters John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, it gives an inside look to the candidates through candid interviews, backstage shots and them following the campaign trail.At the beginning of the show, the crew was following Republican candidate Jeb Bush, brother of former President George W. Bush, when he gets a call asking if he would support Donald Trump if he was the nominee to the White House. Bush's reaction was exactly the same as everyone else in the world, "that's not going to happen." Fate proved us all wrong. Since season 3, the show counts with Alex Wagner, an anchor and correspondent at CBS News, since Mark Halperin left. With episodes being released every week, it is a good way to keep track of what's going on.The Comey Rule   Another Showtime jewel, The Comey Rule was written and directed by Billy Ray, based on the former FBI Director James Comey's book "A Higher Loyalty."Starring Jeff Daniels, from the magnificent "Newsroom," as Comey and Brendan Gleeson as a scary Trump, the two-part event series starts with the investigation into Clinton's emails, their impact on the election, followed by the first months of the Trump presidency, when Comey is fired.Daniels portrays a naÃ¯ve honor-bound Comey. "[Comey] thinks that being right will save him. It won't," said an FBI agent.In the first episode, two Russian agents come on screen, commenting on testing a Twitter article with fake information against Secretary Clinton that reached 300,000 likes. The scene is frightening for feeling so real in today's social media environment.The second part begins with the dread of Trump's victory and possible outcomes.Gleeson's Trump is a solemn representation of the president. His speech and mannerisms are on point and additionally grim. When he says, "it's a terrible thing," an expression that is so Trump-like, it sounds daunting. Their exchanges on screen are always tense and on the verge of intimidation.Like the Washington Post said, watching this show is like "replaying a nightmare while we're still having it."Agent of ChaosAlex Gibney directs HBO's "Agent of Chaos," a two-part documentary focused on alleged Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.In an interview with The Guardian, Gibney explained how the Russian government or business interests tried to sow chaos in the U.S. with disinformation campaigns led by "troll factories" that created divisive campaigns in social media, cyber-attacks, infiltration into state election systems; and supporting the Trump campaign.It's a documentary on how chaos can be weaponized "to amass power."In the episode focusing on Trump and Putin, Gibney noted, "It's all about greed, and avarice, and corruption. The agents of chaos in both countries had common interests."Read more: October surprise: Last-minute plot twists that decided U.S. presidentsKnock Down the House Directed by Rachel Lears, this 2019 Netflix documentary might not seem appropriate for now because is focused on the 2018 mid-terms. But the fact that it is centered around four women running for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, Joe Crowley, and Paula Jean Swearengin, makes it significant.This year, for the first time in the U.S. political history, six women ran for President, and one was nominated for Vice-President â Kamala Harris. Now, more than ever, women are partaking in civic life by running for office and donating. Ocasio-Cortez takes center stage as the cameras follow her "run to win" from the bar where she worked to the Capitol, where she remembers a trip with her father to the same place. "I think I finally did it [make him proud]."Immigration NationSeparation of families, the border wall, and other controversial immigration policies and statements also defined President Trump's tenure, and that is why it is on this list. Even if the topic has been gone from the presidential and VP debates and part of the public discussion.Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz were allowed to accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents for over two years, but when the six-part documentary was about to come out, ICE threatened to block the release of some scenes.Only for this, the show must be watched. Secondly, it is easy to understand why the police would want to erase some footage: detention quotas, "collaterals" being detained because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time not because they committed a crime, and agents saying repeatedly they are "only doing their jobs." This sentence crystallizes their attempts to rationalize pain and suffering, perpetuating a system of terror. The Netflix docuseries includes heart-wrenching testimonials of fathers separated from their children, crying on camera wondering where they are, as the first episode carries the weight of their grief, desolation, anguish. And also the story, perhaps unknown to most, of U.S. army veterans that are deported, after all, it mirrors how being allowed to die for the country doesn't equal the right to live in it.(Cover photo: The Circus official poster.)If there is something that U.S. politics thrives in, it is drama.

least the end of May 2021, the industry's trade association  said Friday, a fresh sign that the 2020-21 season will be a low point for live entertainment in the United States.Shows had first been expected to reopen in early September, a deadline which was put off to the beginning of January.But the Broadway League decided to delay again until May 30, 2021 as the coronavirus continues to rage across the country, as well in New York, which was the first epicenter of the disease in the United States."With nearly 97,000 workers who rely on Broadway for their livelihood and an annual economic impact of $14.8 billion to the city, our membership is committed to re-opening as soon as conditions permit us to do so," Broadway League President Charlotte St Martin said in a statement released Friday.That will mean theaters will have been closed for 14 months, an unprecedented length of time for the lights to be out in Manhattan's showbiz heart, which shuttered its venues on March 12. At the moment of shutdown, there were 31 shows running on Broadway and eight others preparing for opening in the spring."We are working tirelessly with multiple partners on sustaining the industry once we raise our curtains again," St Martin added.Some productions have already thrown in the towel, including the musical "The Snow Queen," as well as "Hangmen" and "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"Local media outlet NY1 said two of Broadway's biggest draws, "The Lion King" and "The Phantom of the Opera," would not open again until autumn 2021.Broadway, which pulls in $33 million a week in ticket

Our admissions practices are completely fair and lawful. Yale's admissions policies will not change as a result of the filing of this baseless lawsuit. We look forward to defending these policies in court," Yale President Peter Salovey wrote in a statement to campus Thursday evening, the Wall Street Journal reported.In addition, Salovey countered that the DOJ's allegations are based on inaccurate statistics and unwarranted conclusions."DOJ's claim that the proportion of various racial groups admitted to Yale has remained stable for many years. In fact, in the last two decades, the percentage of admitted applicants fluctuated significantly for all groups," said Salovey.The Washington Post reported that a U.S. higher education association called the Justice Department's lawsuit "shocking and disheartening" and accused it of being politically motivated to bring it 26 days before the U.S. presidential election.The issue of race in college admissions in the U.S. has long been controversial, the report said. Supporters say it would bring diversity to education and critics saying the practice gives an unfair advantage to some applicants solely based on the color of their skin.(Cover image from CFP)The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit Thursday against Yale University, accusing the university of violating federal civil rights laws by discriminating against Asian-American and white applicants in favor of applicants of some certain races.According to the Washington Post reported Friday, the U.S. DOJ in the situation of the Yale University admissions after a two-year investigation, pointed out that the school attaches importance to the racial factor in the admission, and is too biased in favor of applicants of certain races, including African-Americans, Hispanic, Native American, Pacific Islander and some Asian subgroups such as Cambodian, Laotian and Vietnamese.In contrast, among applicants with the same degree, Asian-Americans and whites are only one-eighth to one-quarter as likely to be accepted as African-Americans, the DOJ said, citing data.However, Yale has denied the allegations."I want to be clear: Yale does not discriminate against applicants of any race or ethnicity.

But the public's wrath, fear, and grief are subsiding as this becomes just another case relegated to the annals of domestic violence.A farmer living on picking herbs in remote mountains in northwestern Sichuan Province, Lamu enjoyed sharing everyday life with her nearly 900,000 fans on the popular short video app Douyin. She regularly posted videos of working in the field, cooking for her family and dancing to Tibetan melodies. On camera, she was a happy-go-lucky woman fighting for a better life for her father and two children. But all of that abruptly ended when her former husband, surnamed Tang, broke into her home during one of her livestreaming sessions. Tang doused her in gasoline and then set her alight, burning 90 percent of her body, in addition to stabbing her multiple times. She died on September 30 after 16 days of medical treatment.Lamu's death sparked an outcry among netizens throughout the country as they demanded justice for her. Within a few days, hashtags mentioning her name received more than 420 million views. Nevertheless, the attention has been short-lived in this frenzied era of social media. People are outraged when such atrocities highlighting gender inequality continue to happen, but they soon forget, until the next "Lamu" appears.What went wrong? It seems that people unconsciously understand that such horrendous cases will inevitably happen again and again, and grow accustomed to these whopping numbers: More than 90 million married women in China regularly face domestic violence. Some 157,000 Chinese women commit suicide every year on average, making it one of the few countries where the female suicide rate is higher than it is for males, and among them 60 percent kill themselves because of domestic violence. On average the victims don't call the police until they've been abused at least 35 times."Violence will become the solution where law, morality and negotiation are all out of control," said Wang Fengli, a Beijing-based sociologist who studies domestic violence, during an interview with CGTN.China is a latecomer to having a legal interpretation of family violence. It wasn't until 2001 that physical abuse could be considered a reason to file for divorce. Only in 2016 did China's first anti-domestic violence law come into effect. It helps victims of physical or mental abuse in the family through various means such as restraining orders.But it "has loopholes," said Peng Chun, assistant professor of Peking University Law School. "It covers married couples, cohabitating partners, and other family members, but it does not deal with violence against former spouses or intimate partners who do not live together." As seen in Lamu's case, she was no longer eligible for a protection order because she was divorced, even though she'd been abused and threatened by Tang for a decade.Late last year, He Yuhong, a Chongqing-based beauty blogger who goes by the name Yuyamika, posted a video including surveillance footage that shows her ex-boyfriend violently dragging her from an elevator despite her struggling and yelling for help. "For the past six months, I seem to have been living in a nightmare," she wrote.The challenge in defining what constitutes domestic violence as well as the difficulty in gathering such evidence usually lead to delays in or rejections of issuing personal safety protection orders, according to Peng. In 2019, over 2,000 such orders were granted, triple that in 2016, but that was a far cry considering the hundreds of thousands of victims every year. Plus, the law fails to address sexual abuse or economic control.The gaps in the law and its enforcement aren't the only factors discouraging the abused from seeking justice. There is a deep-rooted mentality best encapsulated by an old Chinese saying, "Even upright officials cannot adjudicate family affairs." Due to this distinction, some police and judges would take family violence a private matter that should be dealt with by the family themselves."Thousands of years of patriarchy means that males are responsible for the fate of a household," said Wang. "In conservative or patriarchal societies, the rates of family violence are higher."This notion of tribal justice extends to cases such as Lamu's, where police only take the matter seriously when it ends in tragedy. Reports say that Lamu went to local police for help multiple times since last year in attempts to get a divorce. The authorities ended up giving Tang verbal warnings instead.Statistics from the All-China Women's Federation show that 80 percent of women calling the police for domestic violence are ignored because they are considered "family affairs" instead of criminal activity. Some of these women were even reprimanded by the police.The more difficult fight, however, lies in changing prejudices against those suffering from domestic violence. Even though Lamu was the victim, a few netizens on Weibo said that she must have done something wrong in her marriage to deserve being beaten, or that she shouldn't have attracted such attention by becoming an Internet celebrity/sensation. Those with this mentality essentially criticize the female victim for displaying too much agency or not living up to certain standards, while diminishing the male aggressor's responsibility.Wang thinks the psychology of victim-blaming is the biggest obstacle in the fight against domestic violence. Lamu is a "perfect victim" in many ways â an independent woman who struggled to divorce twice and supported her family on her own. She was fighting against her ex-husband, his violence and her fate, but she couldn't survive.Tang reportedly beat her not just at home, but overtly in the street. Lukewarm reactions from authorities in that small village ingrained with chauvinistic attitudes only hastened the onset of tragedy.But that can't explain it all. In relatively progressive societies, tragedies still happen. Hong Mei, a 40-year-old journalist who was in particular covering domestic violence in Ordos in Inner Mongolia, suffered violent beatings from her husband for over a decade before she died from abuse in 2016.It's not all gloom and doom. "The number of protection orders issued nationwide is on the rise, which shows that family violence victims are taking the initiative to protect themselves," Feng Yuan, co-founder of Equality, a Beijing-based NGO, told CGTN. In 2016, courts throughout China granted only 687 such orders; the figure rose to 2,004 in 2019.Meanwhile, the supreme court issued guidelines for local courts to reduce the burden of proof on plaintiffs, in consideration of the difficulty in acquiring the substantial evidence of abuse needed to apply for restraining orders.Lamu's tragic ending is part of a story that has been told again and again, as part of a cycle of complicity in which society chooses to ignore and forget simply because it's the easy thing to do. Attitudes toward domestic violence can only change when the public decides that one more incident of abuse is too many.Even now, users on social media lament that Lamu could have escaped death if she hadn't gone down from the mountains. But a world where Lamu could have lived her life without fear wherever she could have chosen to be is a world that we should strive for.(China 24, Zeng Ziyi and Yu Jing contributed reporting.)If you have a story on family violence and want to share it with us, please write to stories@cgtn.com.Also, if you or someone you know is suffering from domestic violence, please call this hotline (China only): 15117905157.It's been barely a week since Lamu, a 30-year-old woman from southwest China, died after being set on fire by her ex-husband.

local media reported Thursday. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, the 11 countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than

countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than three months also being eligible.Eligible travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 before entering Japan and upon arrival in Japan, while their sponsors, such as companies or organizations which support them, will be expected to ensure their self-isolation for 14 days,

for the younger generation, the Strawberry Music Festival (Strawberry), by the independent music label and organizer Modernsky, came back to Beijing on October 5 during the country's Golden Week holiday. It was delayed due to a COVID-19 pandemic that shattered the whole country earlier this year. As the first mega party in the city since, attendees and organizers have pulled out all the stops for the festival. Although the epidemic situation has been significantly improved in China, the festival still took place with strict anti-coronavirus measures: Masks were required throughout the show, body temperature scans were performed at the entrance, disinfection of the venue was carried out throughout the day, etc. As the biggest domestic music festival in China, Modernsky made sure they would not scrimp on talent. The three-day line up featured Chinese singers and bands that have become the focus of attention in recent years: New Pants, Jike Junyi, Vinida, and many others.Miumiu, the six-year-old girl who touched hearts of netizens worldwide with her angelic voice and amazing instrumental skills, was among the artists invited this year. As she stepped on stage as Joyside's special guest, the crowd went crazy. Miumiu - albeit still a kid - is a serious and professional performer when it comes to music. In the half-an-hour-long talk after her show, the agile girl told CGTN how annoyed she gets when her younger brother tries to take away her toys, and of course, how much she loves the Disney animated film "Frozen." Exclusive: CGTN croons with talented guitar girl MiumiuStrawberry 2020 felt more like a family getaway event during the holiday rather than a show only for party goers. Among the crowd were many parents enjoying the buzz with their young kids, showing that the new generation of Chinese parents has their own approach to raising their children.CGTN also came across Deng Ziye, a girl from Wuhan who experienced the worst of COVID-19. She said what she remembered most was the day when Wuhan was locked down and that she "never would've thought something like that would really happen in real life." As a regular attendee of music festivals, Deng was thrilled to come to Strawberry as her first in 2020. She said she now cherishes returning to normalcy and has a different outlook about going to music festivals. "Something that I used to take for granted has suddenly become so precious," Deng said.The pandemic also caused a lot of challenges in the hosting of the event. For example, according to Chen Yunong, the Beijing Strawberry coordinator, they had to reschedule the festival several times and limit the number of attendees to a total of 25,000, whereas in previous years, it would be 100,000. But with the full support from the Beijing government, the festival was held successfully and has provided a benchmark for its peers.The cultural industry alongside with the country's economy is reviving as the COVID-19 pandemic eases in China, and the Strawberry Music Festival is just one of the the latest examples.Cameramen: Wang Zeyu, Wang YananNormally held in April and May as one of China's symbols of "spring" for the younger generation, the Strawberry Music Festival (Strawberry), by the independent music label and organizer Modernsky, came back to Beijing on October 5 during the country's Golden Week holiday.

The designers apply not only the 24 solar terms but also the 72 pentads of the Chinese phenology, which started from Han Dynasty some 2,000 years ago. "The 24 solar terms were inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2016. But the 72 pentads are not known to most people. To us, the 24 solar terms are too broad because the plants change every 5 to 7 days. With the 72 pentads we're able to fix the botanical materials to suit varied needs," said Zhao Sumin, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Gardenscape.Zhao's company grows around 1,500 different kinds of plants. Most of them are imported from the United States. In the past 18 years, she and her workmates have provided services to private and public spaces. However, her biggest wish is to revive the biodiversity in northern China. "I went to Minnesota, the United States in 1991 as a visiting scholar. I found that the private gardens and the whole city were rich in types and colors even in fall and winter. Four years later I started to introduce the greenhouse technology to China and then the work of industrial seedling raising. I realized what China needed the most was to import more colors of the nature, or let's say biodiversity. This is a long-term plan," Zhao said.Her company was designated as the national forestry germplasm source bank in 2006, the only one in Beijing and the only private enterprise of its kind in China. The State Forestry Administration experts were deeply impressed by the more than 110 kinds of Chinese flowering crabapple trees in the garden. "The crabapple trees were from China originally. They were found in a very wide range of areas from Hebei to Yunnan provinces. In the past two to three centuries, they were brought abroad and now there are over 600 kinds of them in the American archive. I chose the types which fruits don't fall in winter so the clients are able to enjoy the flowers in early spring, red and yellow leaves in fall and fruits when it snows. Also birds can eat the fruits in winter," Zhao said.Chinese people's longing for a better environment has been growing strongly in recent years. Gardening is widely applied in urban landscape, parks, expos. companies and houses. Zhao said her biggest wish is that people can go out and embrace nature. And more importantly, respect nature. "Gardening has become a part of Chinese people's lives. We have been working on combining the imported plants with local wild ones. We hope that people can know more about plants and respect them. Our gardens are opened to botanists, designers, families and schools from time to time. Nature has been nurturing humans and we should cherish its contribution and build a healthier ecosystem," she said.Through the sophisticated designs by botanists, Chinese urban dwellers are now able to escape their bustling day-to-day lives, and find some inner peace while at it. At the just concluded Beijing Design Expo, one of the major offline events of the Beijing Design Week, this tiny garden attracted much attention. The stall is just a very small part of the business of the Beijing-based botanical company and seed bank. In its 9 gardens in the outskirts of the city, visitors are able to experience vibrant colors any day of the year.

Sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy in 2017 and forced it to postpone the 2018 prize â a first in 70 years.Two laureates were named last year with the 2018 award going to Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian novelist Peter Handke honored as the 2019 Nobel laureate. Handke's prize unleashed a flood of criticism as the writer is known for supporting Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in the Balkan wars.Gluck would have received the accolade from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.The in-person ceremony, however, has been canceled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It's the first exhibition to open in the British capital since the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lockdown to the UK's public spaces, including art galleries and museums.Getting Nauman's installations in place has taken seven weeks â an unusually long time to set up an exhibition, due to new measures to limit the number of people in the space at any one time. But for curator and former director of Tate Nicholas Serota, the wait was worth it."We've had to take every possible precaution. And, of course, the visitors, when they arrive, will be given every possible safeguard. But it's the most exciting moment to have a new show by a great artist in one of the great museums of the world," Serota said.Nauman's work spans more than 50 years and some themes reoccur over time, such as the human body, lettering and language, and physical and psychological pressure. In a career that defies easy categorization, he has experimented with neons, video installations, sculpture and more.In addition, some works have taken on new meaning in this era of COVID-19. The piece "Hands Washing Normal," for instance, shows someone washing hands vigorously with a lot of soap."This is a piece that was not made this year. It was made in 1996. So Nauman takes these rituals that we all perform and makes us look at them even more carefully. And whatever resonance that piece had in 1996, it certainly has a very different resonance in 2020," said Serota.Nauman may not be as famous as Andy Warhol or Yayoi Kusama, but his impact on the art scene is undeniable. His exploration of the dull, everyday life is what makes this exhibition special, according to art critic for Londonist Tabish Khan."When you first go in, it's slightly strange because you think art is meant to be beautiful or is meant to be inspiring. But here we are celebrating the mundane, the inane, sometimes the slightly awkward, confusing or even disturbing," Khan said."We like to celebrate the moments that are great, but at the same time, it's also filled by moments where nothing actually happens," he added.The exhibition runs until February 21, 2021.(With input from AP)Tate Modern, a modern art gallery in London, launched a new exhibition on Wednesday, displaying a variety of works by American conceptual artist Bruce Nauman. It's the first exhibition to open in the British capital since the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lockdown to the UK's public spaces, including art galleries and museums.Getting Nauman's installations in place has taken seven weeks â an unusually long time to set up an exhibition, due to new measures to limit the number of people in the space at any one time. But for curator and former director of Tate Nicholas Serota, the wait was worth it."We've had to take every possible precaution. And, of course, the visitors, when they arrive, will be given every possible safeguard. But it's the most exciting moment to have a new show by a great artist in one of the great museums of the world," Serota said.Nauman's work spans more than 50 years and some themes reoccur over time, such as the human body, lettering and language, and physical and psychological pressure. In a career that defies easy categorization, he has experimented with neons, video installations, sculpture and more.In addition, some works have taken on new meaning in this era of COVID-19. The piece "Hands Washing Normal," for instance, shows someone washing hands vigorously with a lot of soap."This is a piece that was not made this year. It was made in 1996. So Nauman takes these rituals that we all perform and makes us look at them even more carefully. And whatever resonance that piece had in 1996, it certainly has a very different resonance in 2020," said Serota.Nauman may not be as famous as Andy Warhol or Yayoi Kusama, but his impact on the art scene is undeniable.

Previously, the film was shortlisted at the Cannes Film Festival in 2020 as one of only two finalists among Chinese-language films.The film centers on China's post-90s generation by telling the story of a restless young man named Kun. As he's about to graduate from college, he drops out of the film school and embarks on a journey "marked by restlessness and absurdity, calamity and joy" as introduced on BFI's official website.Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen's "Mangrove" was selected as the opening film to raise the curtain of the festival. It tells the trial of the Mangrove Nine â a group of black activists accused of inciting a riot at a protest â in the 1970s. The movie is the first of the director's five-film series called "Small Axe."A wide range of works from more than 40 countries and regions, including fiction, documentary, animation, artists' moving image, short film and restored classics, will be presented at the festival, according to the LFF agenda.As Britain's leading film event, the LFF introduces new British and international films to London and Britain-wide audience, attracting significant international film industry participation.(With input from Xinhua)(Cover: From left to right are Malachi Kirby, Director Steve McQueen, Rochenda Sandall, Letitia Wright and Shaun Parkes who attend the BFI London Film Festival opening film and premiere of "Mangrove" in London, UK, October 7, 2020. /CFP)The 64th BFI London Film Festival (LFF) opened Wednesday amid rising coronavirus infections across the UK with a total of 58 films from around the world to be delivered both virtually and via physical screenings in the next 12 days.Chinese feature film "Striding into the Wind," directed by Chinese filmmaker Wei Shujun, is among the list of screenings.

She was told by her teacher of a special opportunity to work with helicopters. The project was recruiting students from poor families in Tibet, and she was lucky to be selected as one of them."At the beginning, I was excited and I couldn't believe it," she said.From February 2017, she started her training and learned to operate and maintain helicopters in Jiangsu. Then in March 2018, she graduated, becoming one of the 28 Tibetans who succeeded in being among the first Tibetan pilots to obtain a license.Back in Lhasa, she is now a civil helicopter pilot with the Lhasa Snow Eagle General Aviation. She'll carry tourists and show them around the city of Lhasa, introducing some of its attractions, customs and history. She said it's quite different to see the landmark Potala Palace up in the air than seeing it from the ground."I feel a sense of accomplishment when I take tourists to see Lhasa from the air," she told CGTN.With a pair of aviator sunglasses and a pilot uniform, Janre Yeshi is ready to board the helicopter and show tourists what the city of Lhasa looks like from above.Born and raised in an impoverished family in Lhasa's Dangxiong County, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, the 23-year-old Tibetan girl never imagined that her life could encounter such tremendous transformation.Back in 2016, a poverty alleviation project launched together by the local government and the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu utterly changed her life path.It was around the time of the national college entrance examination when students from across the country were busy preparing for the exam.

A total of 500 works from those young artists are on display, covering a wide range of art forms, including oil painting, traditional Chinese painting, sculpture, installation, video and multimedia. With the theme "IN/OUT," the exhibition is divided into three sections: "fluid society," "natural simulation," and "the deduction of civilization." Through their artworks, young artists express their understanding of nature and their reflection on technology and society. In a multimedia work named "Gaze into Haze," people are able to see multi-layered information like the silhouette of visitors, English words, LEGO and fish in the background, yet none of them can be seen clearly. The artist wants to mirror the information explosion that we are currently experiencing. Another work shows a phone number and there is actually a cell phone hidden inside the installation. When people call the number, it makes disturbing noises."It's difficult for us to stay quiet nowadays. Even if you want peace and quiet, you are easily affected by others. So this work reflects our situation in a plain way," says the creator AIWU.Launched in 2011, Art Nova 100 is an art platform that discovers and promotes young artists. Each year, thousands of young artists in China apply for the program, and around 100 are selected after evaluation from experts.Those artists on the final shortlist are invited to participate in Art Nova 100, which includes exhibitions and forums both in China and abroad, as well as a multi-channel artist promotion program. "Over 100 young artists started their career from this platform. Before we started, many art students would either give up on becoming artists after graduation or stay unknown to the public in small studios," Peng Wei, director of Art Nova 100, said."But I feel proud that in the past nine years since the platform was launched, it has helped many young artists follow their dreams," she added.The Guardian Art Center in Beijing is holding an exhibition to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Art Nova 100, which nominates about 100 artists from across China each year.

It took only 3 years to build, and first went into operation 6 years ago.Chen Xin felt curious and excited when he first boarded a bullet train 6 years ago. He still remembers the day he got into a bullet train cab for the first time. He wasn't allowed to touch the control desk because his teacher was afraid that he might do something wrong and force the train to stop. Now he's become one of the best bullet train drivers in Xinjiang.Before 2011, Chen drove either diesel or electric locomotives. But he says driving bullet trains is very different, and much better."Diesel and electric locomotives don't seal properly. Sand still gets inside, even when the windows are closed," Chen said. He had to clean up the sand or it could have damaged the control desk and other devices in the cabin."Now bullet trains are wind and sand proof. So I can focus on my work, safely taking passengers to their destinations," he added.Xinjiang's first high-speed rail line officially opened in November 2014, connecting the region's capital city Urumqi with Hami, a city in east Xinjiang. The 530-kilometer trip used to take 4-6 hours. Today, it takes only 2.5 hours. Traveling by bullet train has now become a new way of life for the locals.Despite the transformation that high-speed railway has brought to the city, for Chen, one thing hasn't changed. That is the sense of responsibility."No matter what kind of locomotives you're driving, you should stick to your sense of responsibility. You should be responsible for yourself, your passengers, as well as the state property," he told CGTN.Chen has witnessed the railway's development in Xinjiang, from diesel locomotives to electric, and now bullet trains. What impressed him the most are the greater levels of efficiency as well as the working environment.The speed limit for trains in Xinjiang is now two times higher than before and Chen believes it'll be three times faster in the foreseeable future.The bullet train is changing people's way of life in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and boosting the region's economic potential.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

This year's Beijing Design Week launched a special section to promote the application of cultural IP. CGTN went to a newly established platform to see how they are trying to revive classical IP and help young designers.At a cafe by the Forbidden City, visitors can enjoy a moment within a space decorated with the well-known "One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" by Wang Ximeng, and have a taste of royal flavor from the Palace Museum, such as "Kangxi Likes Chocolates." And as a model combining modern design and the traditional culture, Si Shi Ying Wu presents the cooperation between inheritors of intangible cultural heritage and designers.All the paintings on the wall were downloaded from a platform called Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Design."Under the CC0 license, a list of famous museums, including the British Museum, has opened their digital materials to the public for free. This is a great leap in the history of human civilization," Zhao Dongbao, co-founder of CC0 Design, told CGTN."It's a pity that only a few Chinese cultural institutions are cooperating with these international organizations.

It is the first of its kind to develop products based on CC0 license."The CC0 license has mobilized more designers to create their own works based on high-definition digital material," Yu Fei, co-founder of CC0 Design, also Assistant President of Sinofaith Group said. "Since then, a lot of amazing artworks have been produced, which are dynamic and popular and somehow extend the life cycle of museum collections. For some time, we've been discussing how to breathe new life into cultural relics. They shouldn't be kept asleep in museums. We need to let more people learn about them and enjoy them. We hope our designers can find these materials easily, and those precious masterpieces will give them great inspiration," Yu said.It's a hope which resonates with young designers. Chen Hui, a product designer said, "It's difficult for us designers to find materials. We have to search a bunch of websites. This website collects all these materials. It is a user-friendly platform and all of these are free."So far, over 10 museums in the world have adopted the CC0 license. Yu expressed his hope that more domestic museums will open up their digital materials as well, giving designers and related industry more opportunities.(Cover image: A replica of Van Gogh's bedroom in Arles at the Beijing Design Expo. /CGTN )How to make the cultural intellectual property industry flourish is one of the hot topics in the design industry. This year's Beijing Design Week launched a special section to promote the application of cultural IP. CGTN went to a newly established platform to see how they are trying to revive classical IP and help young designers.At a cafe by the Forbidden City, visitors can enjoy a moment within a space decorated with the well-known "One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" by Wang Ximeng, and have a taste of royal flavor from the Palace Museum, such as "Kangxi Likes Chocolates." And as a model combining modern design and the traditional culture, Si Shi Ying Wu presents the cooperation between inheritors of intangible cultural heritage and designers.All the paintings on the wall were downloaded from a platform called Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Design."Under the CC0 license, a list of famous museums, including the British Museum, has opened their digital materials to the public for free. This is a great leap in the history of human civilization," Zhao Dongbao, co-founder of CC0 Design, told CGTN."It's a pity that only a few Chinese cultural institutions are cooperating with these international organizations.

He was 65.A person close to Van Halenâs family confirmed the rocker died Tuesday due to cancer. The person was not authorized to publicly release details in advance of an official announcement."I can't believe I'm having to write this, but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning," Wolf Van Halen wrote in a message on Twitter with a picture of the rocker who was 65."He was the best father I could ever ask for," he added. "Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift."My heart is broken and I don't think I'll ever fully recover from this loss. I love you so much, Pop." Born in the Netherlands and raised in California, Van Halen founded the rock group with his older brother Alex in the early 1970s and quickly earned a fan base.He was famous for what became known as "finger tapping" â playing the guitar with two hands, like a piano.He was also known for his guitars, including one named Frankenstein which he pieced together from part of other instruments.Among the group's classics are "Jump," "Panama," "Runnin' with the Devil," and the guitar solo "Eruption.""Ed's a once- or twice-in-a-century kind of guy. There's Hendrix and there's Eddie Van Halen," friend and guitarist Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains said during Grammy weekend in January 2019. "Those two guys tilted the world on its axis."Van Halen has sold more than 75 million albums and has more number one hits on the mainstream U.S. rock chart than any other artist, according to the band's label. The group's album "1984" was to be the band's high point, giving them their only number one single "Jump."The creative tension within the band boiled over during the "1984" tour, with Eddie Van Halen and original frontman David Lee Roth falling out. Roth left the band in April 1985.One of his gripes with Eddie Van Halen was reportedly the rocker's outside work that included providing the lead-in guitar for Michael Jackson's 1983 smash hit "Beat It." However, Van Halen announced a reunion tour in 2007 with Roth performing with the group for the first time in 22 years.Another tour planned in 2012 had to be cancelled after Eddie Van Halen had to undergo emergency surgery.But the band reunited again in 2015 for an extensive North American tour.Eddie Van Halen was known to have health problems that would interfere with his work for years.He underwent hip surgery in 1999 and had part of his tongue removed in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer, likely because of heavy smoking.Although he was declared cancer free following the surgery, the American tabloid news site TMZ reported earlier this year that he had been going to Germany for throat cancer treatment. His drug abuse and heavy drinking contributed to his 2007 divorce from TV actress Valerie Bertinelli after 16 years of marriage."I was an alcoholic, and I needed alcohol to function," he said in a 2015 interview with Billboard magazine. "I didn't drink to party. Alcohol and cocaine were private things to me. I would use them for work. The blow keeps you awake and the alcohol lowers your inhibitions. I'm sure there were musical things I would not have attempted were I not in that mental state."Tributes from some of the biggest names in the music world poured in Tuesday following news of his death."I'm just devastated to hear the news of the passing of my dear friend Eddie Van Halen. He fought a long and hard battle with his cancer right to the very end. Eddie was one of a very special kind of person, a really great friend. Rest In Peace my dear friend till we meet again," Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi tweeted."Sad to hear Eddie Van Halen has passed away. A guitar innovator with a fierce spirit of musical and technical exploration. Prayers and thoughts with his family and friends," Yusuf/Cat Stevens tweeted.Songwriter Diane Warren said in a tweet that "guitars are gently weeping everywhere.

And, it symbolizes China's highest authority.  As one of many structures built to mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, its design and construction draw wide attention.  In 1954, the first National People's Congress was held, but only  about 1,200 deputies attended the conference due to the small meeting venue. Building a larger meeting place seemed an urgent task. Soon after, CPC Chairman Mao Zedong came up with the idea of building an auditorium for 10,000 people. "The Great Hall of the People was a great breakthrough at that time in terms of scale," said Mi Junren, vice chief architect of the Institute of Architecture and Environmental Art Design. "It was not an easy job to build a structure with a floor area of 170,000 square meters. Another important highlight is the halls inside, such as the grand auditorium, which can hold 10,000 people. There isn't another auditorium as big in the world today. The Great Hall of the People embodies the highest technical level of architecture, acoustics, lighting, and sound." In 1958 and 1959, designers and construction workers from across the nation came to Beijing to work on the project. They were faced with many challenges, including the interior ceiling design of the Grand Auditorium. At last, the proposal given by then premier, Zhou Enlai was adopted. He raised the concept of "Water and sky merge in one color.""The most wonderful design of the auditorium is the ceiling," said Mi. "We can see elements like the pentacle stars, sunflowers, and water ripples. The roof of the building is more than 30 meters above the ground, and if the walls and roof form a right angle, then the roof will appear very small. Premier Zhou Enlai suggested that the roof and walls be integrated to form a cambered surface. With lights turned on, people feel like they're sitting under a vast starry sky."  The columns at the east gate of the building were also a challenge. After construction was completed, then Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen decided that the span between the middle two columns should be larger than the rest, according to Chinese architectural tradition. He insisted on the removal of the 23-meter-high concrete pillars. "The central concrete structure was irremovable, so workers tried to remove the decorative surface to the side. After removing the outer surface, the distance between the middle columns became larger than the rest," Mi said.Construction of The Great Hall of the People was completed in September 1959, right before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.  Although six decades have passed, the building continues to look powerful and solemn on the west side of Tian'anmen Square.  (Cover image: The Great Hall of the People. /VCG)The Great Hall of the People, where major national affairs are discussed and decided, is an architectural treasure on Beijing's Tian'anmen Square.

It's 200 kilometers from the Taklamakan Desert. On this day, CGTN met the archaeological team of the site, the oldest ever excavated in Xinjiang.The rammed construction with barbican entrances is called the Ruins of Luntai City, as well as Kuiyuq Shehayer ancient city, which means "city in ashes." It is there CGTN met Dang Zhihao from the Xinjiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology and the project manager of the city ruins. He's been doing archeological work for decades; this is his second project.The archeologists started working there three-and-a-half years ago. They have since uncovered substantial evidence that this ancient site could be traced as far back as 2,500 years, to as early as 500 BC during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BC)."That is to say, at least starting between the Han Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn era, on the northern rim of Tarim Basin, here stands such a city. It shocked us," said Dang.The site's geographic proximity to the Taklamakan Desert has proven to be an enormous challenge for the archeological team in unfolding this mysterious site as the sand blows relentlessly, covering almost everything in dry dust."Compared with central China, the environment in Xinjiang for archaeological investigation is harsh, which makes our work more difficult. But the charm of our work is constantly updating knowledge about the world with new findings. This allows more people to learn about Xinjiang's history, and love the land more," Dang said.Some wall base relics, embroideries, metal works of the ancient city were discovered. But what was this area used for remains obscured.It usually takes two to three decades to finish unearthing a site. But one's life doesn't too have many decades. For archaeologist like Dang, the the process of unearthing a city like this is like raising a baby. Although, he and his colleagues have put much effort into this project, they are still many questions to figure out."We hope to know the city from its birth to death. We hope to understand it comprehensively through our long-time study. As we always say, although we each don't have many decades, we hope to age together in one city," said Dang. "It's worthwhile spending my entire career figuring out one city thoroughly."Filmed by Wang YuchengOn day 25 of our Amazing Xinjiang trip, we arrived in Luntai County in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in the middle of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

CGTN talked with veteran toy designer Stryker Wang who shared his inspirations and his opinion on China's toy market.During the interview, Wang showcased a little dinosaur DIO â the first member of the BeastBox series. It's a toy that can easily turn from a square into a dinosaur. The designer introduced the inspiration of the toy: "No matter what the shape of the toy is, it will always be wrapped up in a square box. So we thought why can't we make the toy a box, and the box is the toy itself. This is how DIO the dinosaur was born.""After its release, the toy received great feedback. Many say they are glad to see that China finally has its own transformative toy. And so we continued our BeastBox series," he added.The series has attracted many followers from both home and abroad. Wang used to work in the video game industry. But he always had a passion for toys. In 2000, he started a magazine about toys. Even though the publication didn't last long, Wang found a direction for his career. He said: "I've always been a kid that likes to play. I'm very curious and always wanted to dig into areas that are not familiar to the public."During the interview, he showed reporter his first toy collection â a little Transformer."My parent gave it to me when I was in middle school as an award for good grades. Even though it is very small, it brings back precious memories. It is fair to say that it is the beginning of my toy career," Wang said. The pop-culture trend of art toys has been developing and maturing in recent years. They first appeared in the 1990s, and their popularity has grown. Today, that demand is strong and the market is booming. Wang said that toys have always been a representation of culture through human development. For young people, toys are also art."Art is not only vases or oil paintings, toys are also a contemporary expression of art. I think the toy culture is very diverse. I hope more people can pay attention to them and realize that they are part of people's lives that are worth collecting and studying," he said. Wang believes that there are plenty of talented toy designers in China, but what's lacking are original styles and a healthy market. "I believe China's toy industry surpasses those of Japan and the U.S. at the base level. By that I mean industrial technology and human input. But on an ideological level we are still far behind. There's a lot to learn, like the ways of thinking and the experience from decades of practice," he said."However I think the gap is narrowing. With the rapid development of China's economy and its toy business, we are now having a lot of cooperation with designers globally," the designer added. "Be an interesting person, do fun things" â Wang says this is a motto for him and his company. He believes as long as people in the industry have true passion and love for this business, China's toy market is sure to grow stronger.Art toys, also known as designer toys, are meant for adults with a collection value produced with creative ideas.

In its holds we discovered military vehicles, porcelain and many crates with contents still unknown."The Karlsruhe had been taking part in Operation Hannibal, one of the largest sea evacuations in history, which helped more than one million German troops and civilians from East Prussia escape the Soviet advance towards the end of World War II.  Documentation from the time suggests the boat left Koenigsberg in a hurry, with a large cargo and 1,083 people onboard."All this, put together, stimulates the human imagination.

They were already down about 80 percent this year, due to the impact of the pandemic on the entertainment industry.  The company reopened its UK cinemas in July but customers numbers have been small since then.Cineworld's CEO, Moody Greidinger, said it was "not a decision we made lightly.""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings," he added. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time."Greidinger's statement also highlighted the challenges the firm faced in getting studios to release new movies.  Cineworld was hoping the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, could help turn around its fortunes. But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added. The world's second largest cinema chain, Cineworld, is temporarily shutting its theaters in the U.S. and the UK.The move is due to low footfall as a result of COVID-19 and puts 45,000 jobs at risk, including 5,500 in the UK.Cineworld's shares in London plunged more than 50 percent at one stage on Monday.

He will be greatly missed and always remembered," the Kenzo fashion house he founded wrote on Twitter.He "helped to write a new page in fashion, at the confluence of the East and the West," said Ralph Toledano of the Haute Couture Federation.His death comes 50 years after he launched his first collection in Paris, which he adopted as his home. "Every wall, every sky and every passerby helps me build my collections," he once said of the city.He retired from fashion in 1999, six years after selling his brand to luxury conglomerate LVMH, and dedicated his time to one-off projects including a design collection at the start of this year.Dreamt of ParisBorn in 1939 into a family of hoteliers, he chose to study art not catering, becoming a star pupil at Toyko's Bunka Gakuen college, where he carried off the top prize. He went on to work for Sanai, a major chain of fashion shops, but dreamt of Paris.The 1964 Olympic Games finally gave him opportunity to come to Europe. The block of flats in which he was renting an apartment was to be demolished to make way for a stadium.Like all the tenants, he was paid compensation and decided to blow the money on a one-way ticket on a cargo boat to Marseille.Arriving in Paris in the winter of 1965, hardly speaking any French, the only job he could get was in a poodle parlour.In 1970, however, he took the lease of premises in the Galerie Vivienne, then a rather down-at-heel shopping arcade. "With a few friends for three months we painted the walls with jungle scenes like Le Douanier Rousseau's Snake Charmer and baptised it Jungle Jap," he recalled later.His first show using amateur models to save money was held there. One of only 20 people invited included the editor-in-chief of Elle magazine, who liked the collection so much she ran it on the front cover.He became a name almost overnight, and went on to revitalize the knitwear industry with his contemporary interpretations.By the early 1980s, when other Japanese designers were making their way in Paris, Takada was already well established on the French fashion scene.His first men's collection was presented in 1983 and his first perfume, Kenzo Kenzo, in 1988.From the early 1980s boutiques opened all over the world in New York, London, Milan, Toyko and Rome, followed later by Hong Kong, Munich, Venice, Bangkok and Singapore.Paris mourns a sonKenzo's romantic style, with its eclectic mix of color, touches of exoticism, ethnic prints and folksy embroidery, suited the mood of the 1970s but adapted well to the sharper-looking 1980s and 1990s.He drew inspiration from his travels as well as Japanese work clothes, such as his favorite military tunics and coats. Peruvian striped blanket throws, colorful shawls, oriental blouses, peasant smocks, printed velvet, were all part of his signature.It was a measure of his success that he was notoriously prey to copyists. British designer Jasper Conran, interviewed on the problem, said he knew of a company in South Africa specializing in ripping off Kenzo, seam for seam. "They make a fortune - more than Kenzo I reckon - but there's nothing he can do about it."He guarded his privacy by building himself a house in the country in the very heart of Paris, only a few yards from the Bastille opera house, complete with authentic tea pavilion and a pool of carp."A designer with immense talent, he gave color and light their rightful place in fashion," said Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo on Twitter.

In his narratives, Cao used flowery language to describe her and their sincere love.Many say that Ye perfectly combines both Western culture and eastern culture in her adaption of ancient paintings. But Ye herself doesn't really agree."I think my paintings are deeply rooted in my hometown and our Chinese culture. I'm a native Chinese. My paintings just look slightly Western in format," Ye told CGTN.Ye studied at the Chinese Academy of Art and the Oslo National Academy of the Arts in Norway. She has also traveled to over 20 countries. She said those experiences might contribute to her  mixed painting style."Many people like me had the experience of studying abroad. We've not only seen Gu Kaizhi but also Michelangelo. This so-called Eastern-Western mixed style is something that comes out naturally from my mind,â she said.Over the past decade, Ye has completed several painting books based on ancient Chinese stories and calligraphy works, including the "Preface of the Orchid Pavilion" ("Lanting Xu') and "Mulan."Reflecting on her years of practice, Ye joked that painting itself is labor-intensive work, like climbing a mountain."I feel the happiest when I'm drawing drafts because I can draw whatever I want. Another moment I feel the happiest is when I finally finish a certain piece. That will give me a sense of fulfillment,â Ye told CGTN.During the interview, Ye also revealed her plan to make a piece related to cats as she is a cat-person. She also said she longs for some breakthrough in future works."I'm more unrestrained and vigorous than what I've presented in my drawings. I hope I can make more imaginative work in the future. I think I'll get the chance to do it.

Teng Kuixing, jury member and also a famous voice director, shared his thoughts with CGTN.With more than two decades of dubbing experience, Teng has given voice to many popular cartoons including "Dragon Balls" and "Crayon Shin Chain." In 2015, Teng was the voice director for the Chinese animation film "Monkey King: Hero Is Back," which was described as the future of domestic animation.Speaking of the work, Teng vividly recalls the process of creation."The creative process was very, very difficult at the beginning. Every line was recorded dozens of times. As you can imagine, we got very tired and numb. We take a break and then go on to the next one, and then come back and listen," he said. "Language is like a musical instrument. It must be in the correct position, no more or less, to arouse the audience's emotions. So, we go back and forth," he added.There were five competition areas in total, with a network competition area on the new media platform. Dubbing fans only needed to upload their works on the network platform to participate in the competition.Following the start of registration on June 16, more than 3,000 entries were received from six regions. The quality of the entries has been greatly improved compared with previous years, among which non-professional competitors account for a large proportion.Having won the Best Mentor Award, Teng thinks the competition has been getting more and more professional. "In both team and individual competitions, the ability displayed is higher than that of previous ones. Of course, we do it every year, and it's going to get better and better, and that's also what we're looking forward to," he said.The participation of more and more professional competitors reflects the growing strength of the industry. As an expert, Teng said there is still a long way to go for the competitors. "More and more people are taking this as a career in this industry currently. Therefore, the elimination rate is higher and requirements keep on getting higher. Only by being better can you stay and have a chance to stand out," he said.Reporter: Yang MengVideographer: Shen LanglangVideo editor: Zhang ChunnanCover image designer: Chen YuyangProject manager: Deng JunfangProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiWinners of the Character Voice Competition were unveiled at the 16th China International Cartoon and Animation Festival (CICAF).

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

The United States sent troops and dispatched ships and aircraft to meddle in the Sino-Korean border. Facing American threats, the newly founded People's Republic of China decided in October to participate in the war to defend its national security and help its neighbor, calling it the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.Hundreds of thousands of young people in China joined the war to defend their homeland, including then 17-year-old Zhou.According to Zhou's memories, Korea suffered unprecedented cold weather that year. PVA soldiers braved temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, eating potatoes and drinking snow water to quench their thirst while carrying out combat missions in the Hwangchoryong area in Korea."We lay on the snow for three days. On the last night, when we finally started to fight the enemy, I couldn't get up anymore. My feet and hands were numb," said Zhou.After the battle, other PVA soldiers found Zhou unconscious in the snow and already suffering from frostbite. If he did not undergo surgery immediately, his life would be in danger. Due to the lack of anesthetics, the doctor wrapped his limbs with ice cubes and performed the amputation while he was in a coma with a high fever.After the surgery, the doctor said, "If he doesn't wake up within seven days, he will die."Zhou's strength helped him survive. Although he lost both his hands and legs, he didn't give up. After returning to China, he took care of his basic needs and also found the will power to practice calligraphy despite inherent difficulties.Over the past decades, Zhou completed nearly 2,000 calligraphy pieces and won many awards in various calligraphy competitions.Zhou's patriotism and perseverance have moved and inspired many Chinese netizens.A video of a veteran amputee doing calligraphy is tugging at the heartstrings of many Chinese netizens.

Many famous directors, including James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, and Ang Lee, along with the Directors Guild of America, the National Association of Theater Owners, the Motion Picture Association of America sent a letter to the U.S. Congress asking for help for the COVID-19 affected cinema industry, Reuters said. In the letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, and Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy, the directors asked that the relevant department prioritize helping industries hardest hit, like the country's beloved cinemas.The letter suggests redirecting unallocated funds from the CARES Act (The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) towards proposals that help businesses that have suffered the biggest drops in revenue due to the pandemic.The pandemic has dealt a devastating financial blow to cinemas, the letter indicated.

Many famous directors, including James Cameron, Martin Scorsese, Clint Eastwood, and Ang Lee, along with the Directors Guild of America, the National Association of Theater Owners, the Motion Picture Association of America sent a letter to the U.S. Congress asking for help for the COVID-19 affected cinema industry, Reuters said. In the letter addressed to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, and Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy, the directors asked that the relevant department prioritize helping industries hardest hit, like the country's beloved cinemas.The letter suggests redirecting unallocated funds from the CARES Act (The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act) towards proposals that help businesses that have suffered the biggest drops in revenue due to the pandemic.The pandemic has dealt a devastating financial blow to cinemas, the letter indicated. Ninety-three percent of film companies recorded more than 75 percent losses in the second quarter of 2020.

They are small meandering alleyways that form a maze of siheyuan, which are single-story homes surrounded by open-air courtyards. Life in the hutong neighborhoods follows a slow pace, giving an atmosphere of days gone by. In many ways, the hutong is more than just an architectural concept. It is a way of life and a living imprint of time. Over the years, many dwellings have been falling apart and truly authentic hutongs are no longer ideal living spaces by today's standards.This is why preserving and restoring hutongs have become an important point of discussion in the urban development of Beijing. Recently, the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center joined hands with Beijing Tian Heng Development Group to revitalize Beijing Shi Cha Hai's hutong neighbourhoods. Hu Xinyu, trustee of Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center (CHP), believes the collaboration between the two is "a perfect match."Hu explains that as a state-owned company, Tian Heng has the capability to acquire courtyards that need repair. And CHP, as a charity group, has the capacity to mobilize volunteers, and contribute to the design and heritage preservation measure in regenerating courtyards. Over the past eight years, Tian Heng has looked to restore 100 courtyards, 30 of which are still under construction.To conserve and protect the courtyard homes, Chen Liming, head of engineering department at Tian Heng adheres to a strict set of principles. "Fix and repair" is the mantra he follows when refurbishing courtyard homes. "Keep what's worth keeping" is also important.For one project, Chen had a new wall built from old bricks retained from the original structure before it was taken down."If we can't keep the entire structure, then we preserve at least parts of it," Chen states.Finally, "recycle what's reusable." Chen believes things like old tiles, wooden frames, and cornerstones are "time prints." Adding them back into the new house and the refurbished home will give it its own distinctive personality. For this year's Beijing Design Week, Tian Heng presented several remodeled projects to the public. Some are rooms transformed into Airbnbs, while others are courtyard homes turned into boutique hotels. These reinvented spaces encourage interaction between local residents and visitors, giving these old neighborhoods a new purpose while maintaining their historical faÃ§ade. Renovating the courtyards by redesigning them in a new light is another way architects are reviving the hutongs. Yinyuan, or the "Invisible Yard" at Bao Chao Hutong had been vacant and deserted over the past five years. But this summer, the 50 square meter courtyard home had a revolutionary makeover. Mirrored floors are used to bring the hutong skyscape into the private alley and see-through glass walls are installed to lighten up the living area. As for existing brickwork and the original wooden beams, they are left exposed across the interior to contrast the new intervention, creating a dialogue between the past and future.Over the past decade, a growing number of Chinese and international architects have been revitalizing these iconic architectures. They are exploring new possibilities for hutongs by reinventing their spaces and re-adapting their uses. But the impact these urban interventions and renovations will have on the hutongs and their rustic charm, only time will tell. The old city of Beijing is lined with hutongs.

Through a tidy array of lights, the enormous natural power is seen pushing the waves forward and pounding against riverbanks harshly, as if countless of silver dragons were vigorously swimming.Under the background of light beams near the river, viewers can savor a skillful water painting created by nature.It looks like a landscape painting on water, but on a closer look, it also looks like a flowing music score that plays grandiose symphonies.According to local authorities, the scenic area has received more than 5,000 visitors within five days by October 1. The number of daily views is estimated to reach a peak on October 4, the 18th day of the eighth month on Chinese lunar calendar, when the tidal bores reach their most spectacular moment.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Jingjie)Now is the best time to admire the Tidal Bore of the Qiantang River, an annual natural spectacle, in east China's coastal city.The picturesque scene featuring magnificent tidal bores rushing under the luminous moon attracted crowds of locals and visitors in Haining City, Zhejiang Province on Thursday night.Since ancient times, the world-famous Qiantang Tidal Bore, which is created by the gravity from the moon and the rotation of the Earth, has been hailed as a "marvelous spectacle on earth."One of the world's largest tidal bores ushered in the best time of the year for sightseeing with the advent of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, coinciding with China's National Day.It has been a great tradition and local custom in the eastern province for over 2,000 years to enjoy the natural wonder and celebrate under the full moon around the festival, when the tidal waves become the biggest bores.The best vantage point for watching the amazing back-flow bore in Haining City made a big innovation this year to improve tourists' experience.Tourists flocking to the riversides can enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to not only hear but watch the amazing scene at night owing to the elaborately designed light beam arrays.The Qiantang Tidal Bore is also called "the Silver Dragon" by locals.

It is the first long holiday over three days since the coronavirus epidemic broke out in January.The tourism industry suffered a heavy blow during the epidemic. With the epidemic largely under control in the country, people are pinning high hopes on the holiday for a tourism boost. Preferential price stimulates tourism boomOne month before the holiday, travel agencies introduced various discounts and subsidies to attract tourists.China's top online travel platform Ctrip rolled out 1 billion yuan of subsidies for the National Day holiday on September 7, while its contender Fliggy backed by Alibaba announced a 10-billion-yuan-subsidy plan one day after. These can be used to book train tickets, hotels and scenic spot tickets.For example, if the subsidies are properly used, the ticket price for Shanghai Disney Resort can reach as low as 199 yuan compared to its normal price of 500 to 700 yuan, and the ticket price for some popular destinations, such as Beijing's Palace Museum and Guangzhou Chimelong Tourist Resort, can be halved.Scenic spots themselves have also striven to attract more visitors, with more than 500 across China exempting or reducing ticket prices. Central China's Hubei Province, which was hardly-hit by the epidemic earlier this year, opened all of its national A-level scenic spots for free to tourists from August to December 31.To further promote consumption, regional governments in collaboration with eCommerce platforms and local business owners, give out consumption vouchers.East China's Shandong Province will issue consumption vouchers valued at 20 million yuan during the holiday, which can be used on more than 340,000 cultural and tourist products. Beijing is scheduled to hand out 12.5 million vouchers in seven batches in October, among which are meal vouchers used in onsite restaurants and take-away food.Epidemic prevention measures taken to keep safetyTo meet the tourists' demand during the holiday, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism recently raised the capped number of tourists from 50 percent to 75 percent in scenic spots.The Palace Museum raised the limited number of visitors from 12,000 to 30,000 since Thursday, the most since it reopened. But visitors should book the ticket online in advance, which is a common practice in most scenic spots across the country.Tourists are also arranged to visit in staggered time. Xinhua reported that 90 percent of 280 national 5A-level scenic spots have set up the booking system for tourists to visit in batches.For open-air scenic spots, such as Chaka Salt Lake in northwest China's Qinghai Province, increased number of staff members and volunteers have been deployed to prevent large crowds gathering.China saw 108 million visits and raked in 76.5 billion yuan in tourism income on October 2, the second day of the National Day holiday, while the first day observed a total of 97 million visits with 76.7 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in tourism income, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, raising people's expectation for a tourism boom.This year, the National Day coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, marking an extended holiday of eight days.

It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera.

Mei took the traditional Chinese art abroad in the early 20th century, impressing foreign audiences with his beautiful voice and unforgettable performances. "Peking Opera needs to be passed down from one generation to the next, and our cultural exchanges with other countries also needed to be passed down like this," Yu told CGTN. Traditional festivals give people a chance to know more about time-honored culture like the Peking Opera, and also allows people to enjoy the country's national treasures. (Cover image designed bu Xu Qianyun)The Mid-Autumn Festival falls on October 1 this year, marking one of the most important and poetic Chinese festivals.

It rolled out seven digitalized products at once in July 2019. They include the applications featuring high-resolution images of the museums' famous paintings, 360-degree view of various architecture, interactive games, music videos and comics.The role of digitized products has been highlighted during the coronavirus pandemic this year, as they enable global audiences to experience and appreciate the beauty of Chinese culture at home.The Forbidden City was built in 1925 and served as the imperial palace of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties before turning into a museum. This year marks the palace's 600th birthday, and the museum will host a list of activities, such as exhibitions and academic seminars, to introduce some publications and film and TV productions.Read more:Forbidden City inaugurates exhibition to celebrate its 600th birthdayExperience cultural heritage at home amid virus, digitalization matters(With input from Xinhua)China's Palace Museum, also known as the Forbidden City, can now be experienced by people living over 1,000 kilometers away, thanks to virtual reality (VR) technology.The museum, located in Beijing, shared this latest development in the digitization of cultural relics during the 2020 World Conference on VR Industry, which opened on Monday in Nanchang, capital of east China's Jiangxi Province.Wearing VR glasses, visitors to the conference were able to view vivid 3D images of cultural relics and the construction process of ancient buildings in the Forbidden City.The organizers displayed nine life-size 3D-printed models of the Jingdezhen porcelains collected by and displayed at the Palace Museum, a reference to Jingdezhen, also known as China's porcelain capital.Visitors were also able to make VR trips to archaeological excavation sites where ancient porcelains were unearthed.Zhang Peipei, an engineer with the museum, said that VR technology has been widely used in the digital protection of cultural relics, with visitors able to view the indoor structures of ancient buildings that are closed to the public to protect relics."As the Palace Museum has been committed to the research of advanced technologies and the display of its cultural heritage, it is our mission to build a museum that caters to the needs of the era," said Wang Yuegong, deputy curator of the museum.The new technological trends promote the construction of museum innovation systems, establishing a deep integration of production, teaching and research and enhancing the protection, utilization and inheritance of cultural relics, Wang said.The museum started exploration digitization more than 20 years ago.

With an average age of 90, the artists have made significant contributions to the development of this art-form in China.In total, there are 40 oil paintings on show at Beijing's Longfu Art Center. They were created by major figures in Chinese oil painting â Zhan Jianjun, Jin Shangyi, Quan Shanshi, Zhong Han and Wen Lipeng. They each devoted some 70 years to the art form, and established their own style and artistic language. It's the first time for them to have an exhibition together. "Our generation of painters, we have a sense of responsibility. After studying oil painting, we want to develop this art form in China. It's not like traditional Chinese painting, which has deep foundations in China. Oil panting was imported from the west. So we feel responsible to study it and promote it," said Wen Lipeng. Often addressed as the third generation of Chinese oil painters, the artists have played an important role in promoting oil painting in China. They are also the founders of the China Oil Painting Society. "In the past decades, the China Oil Painting Society has organized many exhibitions. And this time, I'm glad to see an exhibit that features us old people. It's a reminiscence as well as a new beginning for the China Oil Painting Society," said Jin Shangyi.Even in old age, the artists still have a strong desire to create. Many of the works in the exhibition are recent, giving audiences a chance to admire their artistic vitality. What the artists have in common is their insistence on developing oil paintings with a Chinese style. They studied the similarities and differences between Chinese and Western art in great depth. By mastering Western painting skills and combining them with traditional Chinese culture, the artists have managed to create works with unique Chinese characteristics. "The key question is in which direction Chinese oil painting should develop. I think we are clear that we need to follow the Chinese road. It is oil painting, but it's Chinese oil painting," said Wen Lipeng.The exhibition runs until November 30 and is free to the public.An exhibition showcasing the works of five prominent figures who have shaped the Chinese oil painting scene is on display in Beijing.

Its executive chef is 27-year-old trailblazer Lucas Sin.We find Sin in the kitchen of his Greenwich Village restaurant, ready to whip up a dish for a new onsite pop-kitchen called "Nice Day Chinese Takeout" that pays homage to American Chinese foodâ¦ a cuisine that has long fascinated Sin, an immigrant from Hong Kong."This is our take on chow mein, which is very popular in American Chinese restaurants," explained Sin from behind his mask as he speaks over a sizzling wok. "But the way we do it, the sauce that we put in, is more similar to the original Cantonese version than the American version."Sin's take on this quintessential American Chinese recipe hints at how the chef has kept the business going strong in a pandemic that has crippled the economy."I wanted to keep cooking creatively, and I wanted to keep thinking about the things I was interested in despite the pandemic."Sin was eager to defy stereotypes about Chinese food and give it the respect he felt the cuisine deserves, but he also wanted to explore the reach and evolution of Chinese food across cultures."I wanted to give my team a chance to research and think about how Chinese food might actually be good for you," he said.  "There's this sentiment that Chinese food must be bad for you if people are getting sick in China, there's that end of the narrative, and there's also my research in how big Chinese cuisine is across the Chinese diaspora all over the world."With restaurants only permitted take-out and deliveries, Junzi Kitchen launched several new initiatives including its "Share A Meal" program to help feed frontline workers.For his customers, he kicked off a series called "Distance Dining" in which he partnered with a diverse range of chefs to design fully cooked three-course meals that customers can order in advance, to show how Chinese food intersects with the cuisine of other cultures, from Creole to West African."Chinese food seems to have almost an uncanny ability to be everywhere around the world (and) touch so many different communities. I wanted to explore those intersections."Once the food is delivered, diners can tune in to an Instagram Live session with Sin and other chefs for a demonstration on how to properly heat the food for an authentic experience.Straight from the chefs' home kitchens, the sound of cooking is accompanied by a dash of banter and a sprinkle of humor. For those hungry for human connection in these strange times, it puts the "social" in social distancing.But the pandemic has been anything but social. For America's Chinese community, the coronavirus emerged as relations between China and the U.S. deteriorated and spilled over into Chinese communities.In New York, Chinese restaurants were hit by a one-two punch from the pandemic's economic fallout as well as a spike in racism against Asians, fueled by the White House which blamed China for the coronavirus.There were increasing reports of Asians being attacked or verbally assaulted, and Chinese restaurants vandalized and defaced. Sin had beer cans and a fluorescent light bulb thrown at him."Obviously, I'm surprised," Sin said."I think the wonderful thing about coming here to the U.S. as an immigrant is that I have the privilege of not needing to think of myself as a minority, but when friends in the industry especially have been facing expressive anti-Chinese sentiment, I think that's when it really hits home the most," he added.The upside, according to Sin, is that some in the businesses have chosen to build resilience. That might explain Junzi Kitchen's own story of survival."Our primary mission at Junzi is to show people that Chinese food is more wonderful and diverse than they might think otherwise," he told us."Just because there's a pandemic out there doesn't mean that the mission goes away."Unable to weather the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, many restaurants in New York City have gone out of business, but one has defied the odds by focusing on the diversity of Chinese food and the power of social media.The restaurant is Junzi Kitchen, a modern fast-casual Chinese eatery in Manhattan that serves up fare described as authentic, honest and straightforward.

"But the way we do it, the sauce that we put in, is more similar to the original Cantonese version than the American version."Sin's take on this quintessential American Chinese recipe hints at how the chef has kept the business going strong in a pandemic that has crippled the economy."I wanted to keep cooking creatively, and I wanted to keep thinking about the things I was interested in despite the pandemic."Sin was eager to defy stereotypes about Chinese food and give it the respect he felt the cuisine deserves, but he also wanted to explore the reach and evolution of Chinese food across cultures."I wanted to give my team a chance to research and think about how Chinese food might actually be good for you," he said.  "There's this sentiment that Chinese food must be bad for you if people are getting sick in China, there's that end of the narrative, and there's also my research in how big Chinese cuisine is across the Chinese diaspora all over the world."With restaurants only permitted take-out and deliveries, Junzi Kitchen launched several new initiatives including its "Share A Meal" program to help feed frontline workers.For his customers, he kicked off a series called "Distance Dining" in which he partnered with a diverse range of chefs to design fully cooked three-course meals that customers can order in advance, to show how Chinese food intersects with the cuisine of other cultures, from Creole to West African."Chinese food seems to have almost an uncanny ability to be everywhere around the world (and) touch so many different communities. I wanted to explore those intersections."Once the food is delivered, diners can tune in to an Instagram Live session with Sin and other chefs for a demonstration on how to properly heat the food for an authentic experience.Straight from the chefs' home kitchens, the sound of cooking is accompanied by a dash of banter and a sprinkle of humor. For those hungry for human connection in these strange times, it puts the "social" in social distancing.But the pandemic has been anything but social. For America's Chinese community, the coronavirus emerged as relations between China and the U.S. deteriorated and spilled over into Chinese communities.In New York, Chinese restaurants were hit by a one-two punch from the pandemic's economic fallout as well as a spike in racism against Asians, fueled by the White House which blamed China for the coronavirus.There were increasing reports of Asians being attacked or verbally assaulted, and Chinese restaurants vandalized and defaced. Sin had beer cans and a fluorescent light bulb thrown at him."Obviously, I'm surprised," Sin said."I think the wonderful thing about coming here to the U.S. as an immigrant is that I have the privilege of not needing to think of myself as a minority, but when friends in the industry especially have been facing expressive anti-Chinese sentiment, I think that's when it really hits home the most," he added.The upside, according to Sin, is that some in the businesses have chosen to build resilience. That might explain Junzi Kitchen's own story of survival."Our primary mission at Junzi is to show people that Chinese food is more wonderful and diverse than they might think otherwise," he told us."Just because there's a pandemic out there doesn't mean that the mission goes away."The city of Wuhan, hit hard several months ago by the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, is holding a week-long beer festival. The event aims to stimulate the city's nighttime economy in places where drinks, food, and entertainment are offered. Everyone has free access to dozens of festival venues that the local government has set for its more than ten million people. Visitors attending it will find temperature and security checks along with health regulations when they arrive. The goal is to enjoy the event and contribute to the city revival. When it kicked off last weekend, the main venue in Dongxihu District didn't expect the tens of thousands of visitors who turned out, according to the organizer. "We didn't have enough on the first day, as many places serving beer and food were sold out within just half an hour," said Li Jiange, deputy chief of the Business Bureau of Dongxihu. "So, we doubled it the next day, but all of it went quickly again." Given the situation, many wondered if a mass gathering could be done safely. Officials say they conduct daily disinfection before the event. Health workers are monitoring the crowd. Besides, no local cases have been reported for months since Wuhan offered free mass testing in May. "You know, when you now walk in the city, everybody appears to have put those fears aside," said one visitor who celebrated his 50th birthday over some beers with the family. "Since this beer festival is happening, I feel like it's a great opportunity to tell people in other cities in China that Wuhan is fine. We're definitely fine and doing well," a beer vendor said. The event also provides opportunities for many local businesses, especially those featuring agricultural products in the district. Internet celebrities were invited to livestream for them, an increasingly popular marketing strategy now in China. Some stalls are making more than a thousand dollars a day. Young local bands are also putting their first-ever performance this year. Many expect the success of this event will have a positive impact and more large gatherings can be organized in the future.  Read more: Back to normal: Wuhan water party makes overseas netizens enviousThe city of Wuhan, hit hard several months ago by the COVID-19 epidemic in central China, is holding a week-long beer festival.

Both McDonald's and Burger King assured Chinese customers by saying on their official Weibo accounts that the food packaging used in China fully complies with national standards.China prohibits the use of PFAS as additives in the food packaging material so that any qualified packaging does not contain them.Business Insider reported that scientists have uncovered links between PFAS and cancer, liver damage, thyroid disease, and developmental issues. About 99 percent of Americans have the chemicals in their bloodstreams, which could stay in the body for life.The China franchise of McDonald's and Burger King stated on Monday that there are no toxic PFAS substances in food wrappers in China after their overseas counterparts were questioned on the issue.A report released by environmental advocacy groups based in the U.S. revealed on Thursday that the two food chains use toxic PFAS substances, namely human-made perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl chemicals, in the packaging of some of their food.According to the report, testing included 38 food packaging samples from six fast-food chains shows that nearly half of all samples tested positive for fluorine above the screening level, meaning they likely contain PFAS substances.The topic became trending on China's social media.

Among them is opera prodigy, Chinese countertenor Liu Shen. CGTN's Shen Li caught up with him during the festival's "Music at Noon" concert to find out how he came into this career and his future plans.At this mini recital at the Beijing Music Festival, Liu wowed the audience with his performances of Henry Purcell's "Music for a While," arias from some of Handel's operas, and Claude Debussy's Art Songs. He said this varied program helped express "my many sides."Liu is a countertenor, which means he has a vocal range that extends upwards from his natural tenor into mezzo-soprano.At the age of 5, his parents took him to see "La Traviata" and he has been obsessed with opera ever since.He went on to study at the Juilliard School and has collaborated with maestros like conductor Yu Long and the world's leading orchestras.Now at 20, the opera prodigy said he's still finding his voice.Liu said, "The countertenors, they don't just sing operas, there's a lot of non-gender specific pieces that we could do, so it's the best way to express myself."When asked about whether he could like to try music from other genres, Liu revealed his interest in jazz, Broadway music and even Peking Opera. "It's important to understand other genres of music," he added.Liu is able to sing in many different languages, including Italian, French, German and even Hebrew. "My passion for opera really sparks my passion for languages, the twos are somehow connected," he said.Apart from being active on stage as a countertenor, Liu is equally passionate about acting. "Through opera, I found out so many things about acting and music combined together â the beat, the rhythm," he said. "I would love to be an opera director because you get both the perspectives," he added. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the China Philharmonic Orchestra, five young musicians born in 2000 are taking center stage at the closing concert of Beijing Music Festival on Tuesday.

They have special visas that allow them to stay for 90 days with the option to renew twice. The first 14 days have to be spent in quarantine.Among other stipulations, they also need to have proof of travel insurance and medical insurance for in and outpatient treatment, as well as for treatment for COVID-19.After landing, their papers were checked, and their temperatures were taken before they were allowed through immigration. In all, they had to pass through three thermoscans as they walked through the airport, according to airport authorities. As they queued to board buses, workers in protective clothing disinfected their luggage."We can assure everyone that all our measures are systematic and meet international standards," said the airport's deputy general manager Kittipong Kittikachorn.Chinese tourists were seen putting on raincoats as the last step before leaving for their quarantine accommodation. Kittipong said this was not a government requirement, but rather, he said, the raincoats appeared to have been part of a complimentary package of items from their hotel.Almost 40 million people visited Thailand in 2019, with tourism accounting for more than 10 percent of the country's GDP. But the halting of international flights in early April, due to the pandemic, has left the sector in dire straits. Well-known tourist spots, used to hordes of visitors, are now almost empty, as are the country's famous sandy beaches.More flights are scheduled for tourists on special visas in the coming weeks.(Cover: Chinese tourists from Shanghai arrive at Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok, Thailand, October 20, 2020. /AP)Thailand welcomed its first foreign tourists in seven months on Tuesday, bringing a tiny ray of hope to a vital industry that has been brought to its knees by the coronavirus crisis.Thirty-nine Chinese tourists flew into Suvarnabhumi Airport on the outskirts of Bangkok on a Spring Airlines flight from Shanghai.

The director is a woman, Liana Ceterchi. "Each one of us is a facet of Ana Novac's soul and memory," Morgenstern said. The play's author, born Zimra Harsanyi, hails from Romania's northern Transylvania region. She was deported at age 14. The diary she kept inside a Nazi concentration camp was first published in Hungary in 1966 and later translated into several languages, but it only hit bookshelves in her home country in 2004. Many liken Novac's work to that of Anne Frank, author of the "The Diary of a Young Girl," which documented her life in hiding in the Nazi-occupied Netherlands before she was deported to concentration camps. "We are bearers of scars from wounds that are not directly ours, but still we carry these scars," Morgenstern said. She stressed the importance of evoking events through theatrical performance "in order to understand the ghosts of a painful past, the memories of terrible events that have split the world into executioners and victims."Actresses wear the striped outfits of concentration camps against a backdrop of images depicting camp entrances, gas chambers and empty sleeping quarters. Photographs and names of Holocaust victims scroll in a video over the stage and performers. The performers also hold human bones and a skull during monologues. The pandemic has had a severe impact on Romania's artistic community, triggering the closure of theaters during the lockdown. Later, theaters were allowed to hold performances only outdoors, then indoors with a limited number of spectators. "These are existential and also moral questions. What to do to protect life, not to be a threat but at the same time continue our existence and activity and maintain our status as artists?" Morgenstern said.(With input from AP)(Cover image: Actresses of the Jewish State Theater in Bucharest, wearing face masks for protection against COVID-19, perform during rehearsals for the premiere of "The Beautiful Days of My Youth," based on the diary of Romanian Jewish Holocaust survivor Ana Novac. /AP)The latest premiere at the Jewish State Theater in the Romanian capital, Bucharest, explores the horrors of the Holocaust via a survivor's memories of the Auschwitz and Plaszow concentration camps. Friday's debut of "The Beautiful Days of My Youth" by Romanian Jewish Holocaust survivor Ana Novac follows the National Holocaust Remembrance Day commemorations on October 9, the day when deportations of Romania's Jews and Roma began in 1941. Some 280,000 Jews and 11,000 Roma were deported and killed under Romania's pro-Nazi regime during World War II.The play premiered online and in front of spectators who took up less than a third of the seats because of measures meant to slow the coronavirus pandemic in the eastern European nation. Maia Morgenstern, head of the Jewish State Theater and a Romanian Jewish actress best known for playing Mary in Mel Gibson's controversial 2004 movie "The Passion of the Christ," described the play's staging as an "all-female project."

among those presenting honors to pandemic-era student filmmakers.The Student Academy Awards are a key program of the Hollywood film industry's top body, which has already delayed next year's Oscars as speculation builds that the glitzy main ceremony may also take place remotely."I'm hopeful, as we all are, that this will also be the last virtual Student Academy Awards," said Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president David Rubin, signaling desire that the industry can soon return to normal."Just as inflection points like the Cold War and 9/11 shaped the perspective of past generations of filmmakers from Stanley Kramer to Kathryn Bigelow, 2020 â a year like no other â will no doubt forever influence what your generation sees through the camera lens."Students honored at the online ceremony described how lockdowns around the world had affected their finishing touches to movies shot as part of their academic programs."I did change the sound of what my film would have been," said Pilar Garcia-Fernandezsesma, who won the top animation prize for her film "Ciervo" after moving back in with her parents."I ended up putting flute in my film, when I probably wouldn't have done, because I had access to my middle school flute lying around in my bedroom."Allison Waite, honored for her documentary about a Black teen shot dead in a Los Angeles convenience store, said despite the challenges of the pandemic, "being silent at this moment was not productive.""With things happening in the US, with George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, there's so much discussion to be had," she said.Past student winners include Lee, "Back To The Future" filmmaker Robert Zemeckis and upcoming 007 director Cary Fukunaga.A record 13 of the 18 winners were women in this year's version of the

Claude Monet masterpiece was sold in London on Wednesday for about 7.5 million pounds (about $9.8 million), the second highest price at auction for the mysterious artist.The oil on canvas work, "Show Me the Monet," a modern take on Monet's impressionist classic "The Water-Lily Pond," was sold at Sotheby's following a bidding battle."The hammer came down after five determined collectors battled for nearly nine minutes to drive the final price beyond its estimate of 3,000,000-5,000,000 pounds to become the second highest price for the artist at auction," Sotheby's said.The sale comes a year after a Banksy painting depicting the British parliament populated by chimpanzees smashed the record for the street artist by fetching nearly 9.9 million pounds.On that occasion, the 2009 work titled "Devolved Parliament" attracted a 13-minute battle between 10 different bidders."Show Me the Monet" was created in 2005, as part of a collection called "The Crude Oils" and had first been shown publicly in only Banksy's second gallery exhibition.The painting transforms Monet's masterpiece depicting a Japanese-style bridge in his famous garden at Giverny into a modern-day fly-tipping spot.Instead of an idyllic lily pond, the composition shows discarded shopping trollies and a fluorescent orange traffic cone floating in the water beneath the bridge."Ever prescient as a voice of protest and social dissent, here Banksy shines a light on society's disregard for the environment in favor of the wasteful excesses of consumerism," said Alex Branczik, Sotheby's European Head of Contemporary Art."Recent years have seen seminal Banksys come to auction, but this is one of his strongest, and most iconic, to appear yet," he added.Banksy has become a household name since the turn of the century, after his iconic graffiti paintings began to appear overnight on buildings and at sites around the world.The artist's identity remains shrouded in mystery even as his works have begun to attract increasingly high sums at auction.Meanwhile, he continues to use his art in stunts that generate huge publicity.In 2018, his "Girl With The Balloon" partially shredded itself as the hammer came down at Sotheby's, becoming the re-titled "Love Is In The Bin."(Cover: A visitor looks at Banksy's 'Show me the Monet' on display at Sotheby's in central London, UK, September 18, 2020. /CFP)An

Instead of sashes, buttons are commonly used. Coming up is the most debated one: The Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) ensemble. It looks quite similar to hanfu, the traditional costume for Han Chinese, but it also breaks a few rules. The collar should lap for both men and women. The sleeves should be long and wide to meet the two words: kuan and he. Sashes should be used instead of buttons. As for Western clothing, the men's jacket is a typical example. Tailoring requires a proper fit for the individual achieved with cutting and seams. The Vietnamese ao dai, or Vietnamese long dress, is often thought to be related to hanfu, but it is more like a qipao.  The tunic is fitted with a stand-up collar fastened with buttons. It's the national costume of Vietnam. Very similar to the ao dai, the blue dress is a traditional costume mostly seen in Southern China.  The outfit does include hanfu design elements, but essentially, it is also an outfit with Western influence. The dress uses Western dimensional cutting, and its collar disqualifies it from being hanfu. Now, can you spot the differences? Read more:Tradition goes modern: What the Chinese Hanfu clothing system is all aboutWhen talking about traditional Chinese clothing, the tangzhuang (Tang suit) and the qipao (cheongsam) are probably the two best-known styles, but hanfu experts and enthusiasts insist they are not authentic. Even though they have kept traditional Chinese motifs, Western tailoring is used in the garments instead of hanfu's  plain cutting on just one piece of fabric.  Referring back to the first episode where we have talked about the eight characteristics of hanfu, they are "ping zhong jiao you, kuan tuan he ying."  In comparison, the shoulders of the tangzhuang and qipao are designed to fit.

On the one hand, it has helped China's distance education, and on the other hand, it has provided a large number of online job opportunities for the Filipino people," said Ambassador Huang Xilian, Chinese Ambassador to the Philippines, during his keynote speech at the 2020 Sino-Philippines Educational Exchanges Seminar held in Beijing on Friday.The event, hosted by 51Talk, one of China's leading online English education platform, aimed to further strengthen and develop bilateral education exchange and cooperation between the two countries in the year marking the 45th anniversary of the founding of bilateral relations between the Philippines and China."51Talk has fully tapped the talents from the Philippines in the past several years. With the help of online digital technology, 51Talk has opened a window for thousands of Chinese children to communicate with foreign teachers worldwide, and it has created a worthwhile online platform for China-Philippines educational cooperation," said Ambassador Huang.Philippine Ambassador to the People's Republic of China, H.E. Jose Santiago Sta. Romana is glad to see many Filipinos teaching Chinese students via internet."I'm very pleased that 51Talk is giving an opportunity to 20,000 competent Filipino educators to take part in nurturing the eagerness of nearly 300,000 young Chinese people to learn the English language. This educational exchange albeit virtual provides an enabling environment for cultural exchange between Filipinos and the Chinese," said Ambassador Sta. Romana, adding that he hopes "more doors will be opened up for more and more Filipino educators in the same mutually beneficial manner."ESL market has seen a rapid growth in China in recent years with the deepening and widening reform and opening up policies. This has witnessed many companies concentrate on providing quality English education to Chinese students by hiring foreign teachers to teach on their online platforms.51Talk has set up several bases in Philippines to help the organization hire and train Filipino educators. Tens of thousands of Chinese students are estimated to improve their English speaking abilities with thousands of Filipino teachers on the platform.This year, the global pandemic struck countries worldwide including China and Philippines. As the pandemic caused economic fallout and the loss of millions of jobs, 51Talk launched several campaigns to spread awareness of the livelihood opportunities available in the platform to attract 30,000 online English teachers.Besides, the organization donated 5.25 million pesos (0.11 million U.S. dollars) worth of medical equipment and supplies to several hospitals in the Philippines to aid in their efforts to combat COVID-19.Jack Huang, CEO and Co-Founder of 51Talk, said he is happy to see the online education helps strengthen the ties of our two countries.In June, 51 Talk launched an online video album of people waving in both the Philippines and China, where more than 5,000 people engaged. The attempt was judged by the Guinness World Records for the largest number of people waving on an online video album.The attempt is said to express the friendship between the two countries in celebration of the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations as well as to show to the world the unity and relationship between the peoples of both countries.The booming online education and increasingly popular Filipino teachers in China's ESL (English as a Second Language) market is helping to bolster a win-win development for China and Philippines."China's emerging industries such as online education under the epidemic have catalyzed a new win-win cooperation model for China and the Philippines.

As the camera was introduced to China in the mid-19th century, also the late Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), studies and researches are carried out in a more in-depth way.At a preview of an upcoming photograph auction held by Yingyi Auction House, part of the Chinese history and people's lives in the past 180 years is revealed. The barber, the courtroom, and women with bound feet were some of China's iconic images through the lens of Western photographers in the 19th century.David Knox Griffith's four books of photographs taken in China during the late Qing Dynasty are considered the highlight. As a photographer and co-founder of a studio in Shanghai, Griffith has recorded different aspects of city life across the country since the 1870s."This is the first time we have discovered such a big body of work by the British photographer, David Knox Griffith," said Li Yi, general manager of Yingyi Auctions. "The pictures he took in Chinese cities like Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong and Macao in the late 19th century are valuable records for studying Chinese history. We can also see clear clues of the photographer's career development through these four books of pictures," Li added.Contemporary photography is quite different. Modern artistic expressions and techniques are merged into a series featuring gardens in the city of Suzhou by Chinese photographer Hong Lei."They appear in the form of photographs, but the artist has actually re-created on the original pieces two or even three times, by hand coloring it, or sanding it to reflect changes in history," said Li.The most important element in contemporary art is the artist's inspiration and ideas in creation. It's quite different from the documentary type, which just captures real moments in life, Li concluded.(Cover: A picture of three women in the late Qing Dynasty, photographer unknown. /CGTN)The history of China's last imperial dynasty, the Qing, has long been studied by scholars and history fans around the world.

An interesting change for Chinese fashion this year is plenty of Chinese elements in garments, some of which are even intended for export.Ten-year-old clothing firm Hemu has always labeled itself a Chinese-style brand, and their new designs for this season's Shanghai Fashion Week have been inspired by one of the oldest Chinese classics, the "Classics of Mountains and Rivers" (Shan Hai Jing). The ancient book tells stories of mythic geography and beasts, and the designer has brought it all into his new collections, aimed primarily at young Chinese."The fashion industry can speak for Chinese culture. Though there are more foreign markets that like Chinese designs, that market still needs to be further developed. Our major consumers are still domestic buyers who love Eastern culture and traditional Chinese handcrafts," said Yang Fengrui, founder of Hemu.Hemu is not the only Chinese brand that is focusing on China Chic. Five-year-old Mukzin is running a special show this year, with designs inspired by traditional clothing from China's Qinghai Province. Plenty of the younger customers were pretty excited by the traditional Chinese elements on the show.Local buyers' enthusiasm for China Chic is reflected in the number of orders Mukzin has received since the show opened a week ago - they're up 70 percent from this season a year ago. The company's CEO said that one of the crucial reasons for the increasing popularity of Chinese-style clothing is the widespread popularity of traditional culture in modern film and television programs."TV dramas and TV shows have a large impact on the young. There are costume dramas and reality shows such as The Rap of China and Street Dance of China. Contestants' performances have Chinese cultural elements, and all of that has a subtle impact on consumers," said George Feng, CEO of Mukzin.Chinese elements were very prominent in the new designs debuted at this season's Shanghai Fashion Week. By showing them off at the fashion gala, the Chinese-style clothing is expected to draw in a wider range of international customers.Shanghai's Spring and Summer 2021 Fashion Week is now presenting the city's fashionistas with plenty of new design debuts.

Many stories depict farmers, describing the significant transformation of China's rural areas over the past 40 years and reflecting the twists and turns of their spiritual sublimation in the transformation.China's first rural-themed TV series, "Three Families," aired on China Central Television on May 22, 1978, marked the beginning of the development of TV series in the new era, which is also a reflection of the reform and opening-up of the countryside.The story of the three families revolves around a 100 yuan loan (about $63.4 back then). One of the families needs the money for their pig farm and one for their child's wedding. In those days, as little as 100 yuan could cause a big problem for the whole family.Since the middle and late 1980s, rural teleplays began to focus on the spiritual impact and transformation of farmers in the early stage of this historic transformation.Adapted from Han Zhijun's novel "Destiny Quartet," three-part TV drama "Rural Trilogy" has a different emphasis. The work not only describes the remarkable changes brought by the reform and opening-up of the countryside but also offers an in-depth look at how people deal with the challenges of adjusting to new modern values.Since 2003, rural-themed teleplays have ushered in the creation of the second bumper period. âLiu Laogen," "Ma Dashuai" and many other TV series are beginning to focus on migrant workers in cities.

Many of the themes focus on the impact of the nation's policies. More than that, TV shows are no longer limited by subject matter or time and have started to set their stories in a longer historical context."The Ordinary World," "White Deer Plain" and "The Old Farmer" combine the rural theme with drama narration, which adds a historical background and ideological depth to the works.(Top image designer: Pan Yufei.)The content changes of rural-themed teleplays are closely related to the history of rural reform and poverty alleviation in China.2020 is the year for China to complete the building of a moderately prosperous society in all respects, which means that the root of poverty that has held Chinese people back for thousands of years will be cut off.In this great historical process, many TV series have been paying close attention to the countryside.

When did it begin? How is it being expressed? And how far will it go? You may find the answers in this special exhibition entitled, "Immaterial/Re-material: A Brief History of Computing Art" at the UCCA Center for Contemporary Art.The past, present and future of computing art. This group exhibition at Beijing's UCCA has gathered more than 70 pieces by more than 30 artists from around the world, from pioneers of the 1960s to today's emerging voices. "The exhibition at UCCA is by far the largest exhibition dedicated to digital art so far, and I'm very proud that we present four generations of digital artists, of artists who invented new forms and new images to express a new vision of the world," Jerome Neutres, the curator, said in a prerecorded video at the opening.The title "Immaterial/Re-Material" pays tribute to Jean-FranÃ§ois Lyotard's groundbreaking 1985 exhibition "Les ImmatÃ©riaux," which conceived a new mode of art that reflected the decade's advances in telecommunications technology. By exploring the broad possibilities of computing art and the philosophies underpinning it, the exhibition aims to present the medium not just as a new media form but an entire artistic language.Interactive installations and AI learning is a recurring theme for participating artists.In this "Eye Calligraphy Project," artist Michel Paysant paints with his eyes using his eye tracker connected to an industrial robot equipped with a calligraphy brush. The force of thought and interior design help to realize the "digital calligraphies" of a new generation. Amid the global pandemic, artists believe that exploring computing art is a fitting topic, as technology has more closely connected us."What interests me most is taking this thing that exists in the digital world and bringing it into reality and presenting it as something that viewers can observe many different angles. So, it's not about imagery. It is not about text; it's really about something deeper that we respond to," said Leo Villareal, one of the participating artists."I think that's what we need right now in the world, things that bind us together, things that we can all connect to. So, that's where my work comes from, and I hope that it can help to dissolve some of these boundaries and some of the divisions we're experiencing in the world today."The exhibition runs until January 17, 2021. Computing art is gaining recognition as another medium of artistic expression.

Once depicting himself as the artist who really loves movies, he believes that films and art are inseparable.He won an Oscar for the best art direction in the martial arts blockbuster "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" in 2001, making him more outstanding in the film industry than in other fields like theater, costume design and visual arts which he is also good at.Yip said before shooting this film, he spent a long time studying the art of dance in different dynasties in ancient China, and held many exhibitions as well as participated in many large-scale arts festivals in Europe."Films and arts are inseparable," he said, adding that he would spend a lot of time understanding how the director sees the world, which helps him decipher what kind of a world they would like to see. And after that, he will try to find the most lively and diverse ways to present what directors try to express in the film work.As for how Chinese cinema can become more international, Yip told CGTN that when the Chinese outshine foreign directors in arts, they will shoot films others can't compete with.He also said that director Wim Wenders is one of the famous directors in the world that has a great influence on his creation and personality. Inspired by the way he shot his notable documentary "Notebook On Cities &amp; Clothes (1989)," he noted that Wenders has changed the way to approach film documentaries. For example, the film "The Salt of the Earth" was shot in a dramatic way by presenting many striking photos.Apart from dedicating himself to the film industry, Yip has held many exhibitions showcasing his costumes, photographs, installations and videos across the globe. Yip once pointed out the concept of "New Orientalism" aesthetic, which has spanned across films, dance, theater and opera, and it is about conveying the aesthetic of unique Chinese culture to the international world."The 'New Orientalism' concept is not restricted to culture, it is open to all fields," he explained. "I have done a lot of study on the Chinese philosophy about 'Xu Shi Bing Zhi,' it is something like the existence and non-existence can come together."'The pandemic gives me more time to think'The COVID-19 pandemic might have badly hit the global film industry, but it has prompted many people to calm down and rethink the world and life."The pandemic on the other hand, gives me more time to think," he said, adding that prior to COVID-19, the world was moving at breakneck speed, forcing people to do many things at the same time. It was propelling people to rush forward. "While in the pandemic era, I have been forced to calm down and appreciate the depths of time."When it comes to what efforts should be made to adapt to climate change in the post-pandemic era, Yip noted that we should do something for our planet. When he was once invited to visit Norway, he said they could see shrinking glaciers, and they looked like "corpses" because there was electronic and kitchen waste in the water, which was a very serious matter. Reporter: She Jingwei Videographer: Danzeng Jiancuo Video editor: Chen ShiTim Yip, also known as Ye Jintian, the world-renowned art director, visual artist, stage and costume designer as well as the first Chinese to win an Academy Award, shared his views on arts and films with CGTN during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF) in Xi'an, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.'Films and arts are inseparable'Tim Yip has worked with many influential film directors and artists across the globe and is an Academy Award-winning art director.

Established in August 1958, Western Film Group, also known as Xi'an Film Studio, is one of the six major film groups in China.Among the national film production units, Xi'an Film Studio was the first to win the highest awards at international A-level film festivals. It has won more than 300 domestic and foreign awards, including Golden Palm Award, Golden Bear Award, Silver Lion Award in Cannes International Film Festival, Berlin International Film Festival and Venice International Film, leading the country. It also has the most number of film exports in the country. Some of its representative films include "Farewell My Concubine," "Old Well," "Red Sorghum," "Tuya's Marriage," "Beautiful Feet," "My 1919," and "A Chinese Odyssey" series. Moreover, a large number of top Chinese directors and movie stars have worked with Xi'an Film Studio, such as Zhang Yimou, Chen Kaige, Gu Changwei, Gong Li and Chen Chong.The Belt and Road in Film PostersDuring the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF), Xi'an Film Studio is hosting several forums and events, including an exhibition titled "The Belt and Road in Film Posters." On display are a range of original film posters collected by the studio from all over the world in the past five years. The design, aesthetics and psychology of the posters reflect the nature of the films as well as the times in which they were released. At the same time, these posters reflect the hundred-year history of the ever-changing film industry.The exhibition is divided into five sections: The Earliest Film Posters, European and American Film Posters, Original Drawn Posters, Hong Kong Film Posters, and Xi'an Film Studio Classic Film Posters.The Earliest Film PostersThese film posters originated from commercial posters. There were hand-painted or lithographic-printed in the beginning. Painted in original colors, they have different sizes, from extra small to extra large. This exhibition has the smallest movie poster in the world, about 6 square cm, as well as the largest poster in the world, composed of two A0 posters.In the early 20th century, Thomas Edison united many studios to form a film patent alliance, which established the earliest specifications and standards for film posters.In this context, also on display is the incorrect version of the poster of "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" â it shows Snow White with six dwarfs.European and American Film PostersIt also features various styles of posters from Europe and the U.S., such as classic Hollywood, surrealism and so on. With increasing cultural exchanges, the artistic styles of film posters influenced each other, thereby enriching the artistry of film posters.In this section, Xi'an Film Studio has created special corners for Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe and the film "Singin' in the Rain."It also exhibits the scooter that Audrey Hepburn rode with Gregory Peck in "Roman Holiday," brought all the way from Italy to Xi'an.Also on display is the most beautiful movie poster in the world â a poster designed by German artist Heinz for the classic silent film "Metropolis."Original Drawn PostersAs film posters were originally hand-painted â vivid with a strong sense of storytelling â many became collectible items. Appreciating a hand-painted film poster is just like appreciating a painting.Hong Kong Film PostersHong Kong Film Posters have their unique regional style. Because of the limited cinema space, these posters are usually small with superimposed pictures of the featuring artists. This is specially true for martial arts films made in Hong Kong, as the well-known Shaw Brothers Pictures, Golden Harvest Pictures and the likes brought Bruce Lee, Jackie Chan and other such famous names to fame.Xi'an Film Studio Classic Film PostersXi'an Film Studio has a time-honored legacy and intentional reputation of winning more than 300 awards from China and abroad. It has ushered Chinese films to the world and was the cradle of the fifth generation of directors in China. Many posters created for those classic films produced by Xi'an Film Studio have been exhibited.Car and Film ExhibitionCars and films, two great gifts of the 19th century, have had a tremendous impact on human society. Cars change people's speed of travel, while films affect people's thoughts. When cars drive into films, they are not only props, but also vivid characters showing speed and passion, romance and elegance, technology and innovation. All sorts of classic cars exhibited at Xi'an Film Studio museum have participated in films made by the studio, such as "The Xi'an Incident."The Cine Film LibraryThe Cine Film Library stores a large number of films, including clip materials, formal copies and magnetic recording, serving as a hub of storage, protection, restoration and loan. So far, the library has collected various genres of films and resources, totaling 18,356 copies, including 9,595 copies of material, 6,875 copies of remaining clips and 1,886 copies of magnetic recording.Experiencing 'A Chinese Odyssey'The most fun part of the exhibition is a tour to experience "A Chinese Odyssey", allowing audiences to interact with characters in the movie and go through classic scenes in the movie, such as Bak Jing-Jing's horrifying skeleton hole, almost like a mini version of Universal. A Chinese Odyssey is a two-part 1995 Hong Kong fantasy-comedy film directed by Jeffery Lau and starring Stephen Chow. The film is very loosely based on the 16th-century Wu Cheng'en novel "Journey to the West." Most of the movie scenes were shot in Xi'an Film Studio.This exhibition is a heaven for film lovers and even for escape-room game fans (the Odyssey part).

What some might herald as triumphant regeneration can seem to others like a triumphalist celebration of power; well-meaning schemes to clean up deprived areas can often sweep away what made them vibrant neighborhoods to begin with. There is also the question of taste and style, and the inherent problems when changing fashions are applied not to clothing but to buildings, which should be rather more permanent but are often victim to the sweeping statements of incoming ideologues. Infamously, the Modernist-influenced reconstruction of social housing in the third quarter of the 20th century in the UK especially raised unloved "streets in the sky" by razing the sort of centrally located terraced houses that are now highly prized, and therefore highly expensive, as family homes.   However, those allegedly Modernist high-rises owed much less to architectural idealism than they did to manufacturing opportunism, in particular the cheap modular techniques keenly adopted by cash-conscious authorities. When cheap construction caused expensive problems â many 1960s projects have required extensive renovation or expensive replacement â the blame was laid upon the idea rather than the practice, the form rather than the content. It needn't be that way, and perhaps the impending "green" renovation of Europe's ageing building stock can be based upon more permanent foundations, conceived with the longest-term plans in mind. Reconstruction timeOn September 16, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the EU's new Green Deal would have high ideals. While one major strand of the ecological plan â to cut carbon emissions by 55 percent before 2030 â was reducing vehicle emissions, Von der Leyen was also eyeing the very architecture of Europe. "Our buildings generate 40 percent of our emissions," she noted. "They need to become less wasteful, less expensive and more sustainable. We know that the construction sector can even be turned from a carbon source into a carbon sink, if organic building materials like wood and smart technologies like AI are applied."The aims are eye-wateringly large. According to the EU's stocktaking, "more than 220 million buildings, representing approximately 85 percent of the building stock, were built before 2001." Europe has a lot of buildings, but the European Union has a lot of money to throw at them â the cost of the Green Deal has been estimated as at least $1.18 trillion as Europe aims to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.   One proposed schedule for the "Renovation Wave" of retrofitting buildings would update 2 percent of the continent's building stock every year. Building work on such a huge scale represents an enormous risk â or opportunity. As Von der Leyen said: "This is not just an environmental or economic project, it needs to be a new cultural project for Europe." Luckily, Europe is rich in cultural history, and has done this sort of thing before â which is where the Bauhaus idea comes in. "Every movement has its own look and feel," said Von der Leyen, "and we need to give our systemic change its own distinct aesthetic â to match style with sustainability. "This is why we will set up a new European Bauhaus â a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers [and] designers work together to make that happen." A 'new Bauhaus'But what exactly is this new Bauhaus? According to Von der Leyen: "The New European Bauhaus movement is intended to be a bridge between the world of science and technology and the world of art and culture. It is about a new European Green Deal aesthetic combining good design with sustainability."Wednesday's parliamentary question-and-answer session attempted to set out more details, although some of the answers raised yet more questions. The new Bauhaus "will be an interdisciplinary project, co-steered by an advisory board of external experts including scientists, architects, designers, artists, planners and civil society that will create experimental spaces where art, culture, science and technology can imagine, test and demonstrate new solutions."So far, so inclusive. The expansive ideals will go across multiple disciplines: "All Bauhaus projects would deal with the built environment as a whole but would focus on different aspects, such as climate challenges, accessibility, social cohesion, digital construction, sustainable bio-resources etc... and be in different countries."  As such, the new Bauhaus is described as an "accelerator for affordable and aesthetically promising green and digital solutions, technologies and products." Welcoming proposals, the Commission will "conduct a broad participatory co-creation process."For the time being, then, it is something of a talking shop as it attempts to create a unified ethos and aesthetic from the notoriously competitive world of architecture. There may be a lot of discussion before we start to see a style emerging. But that's not to say the project is heading into a slow death by eternal committee: there is a timeline, and there are even construction plans set in stone, if not environmentally unfriendly concrete. That "broad participatory co-creation process" will only last until summer 2021, with "delivery" starting in the second half of 2021. Intriguingly, the Commission mentions "the setting up of a network of five founding Bauhaus[es] in 2022." With further expansion possible: "In a second wave, further Bauhaus[es] can be added across the EU and even globally."At this point, the New Bauhaus steps off the drawing board and into the real world. It is described as "a forum for discussion, a space for art and culture, an experimentation lab, an accelerator, a hub for global networks and experts, a contact point for citizens interested in the topic."It seems that the new-Bauhaus idea is not simply a useful branding tool â a quick comparison to a well-known previous conceptual movement â but a reference to an actual building, or buildings. And that's entirely fitting for the heritage of the name. Unlike, say, Art Nouveau or Futurism, the original Bauhaus was literally a school: an art school, founded in Weimar in the aftermath of a world-shaking event.  The old BauhausThat Bauhaus (German for "building house") is now identified as a minimalist style is somewhat ironic given the widespread aims of its founders. Although it was founded by architect Walter Gropius â a year after the end of World War I in 1919 â the Staatliches Bauhaus art school always combined fine arts with crafts and espoused a Gesamtkunstwerk ("comprehensive artwork"), a common aesthetic that intended to unify all the arts. Indeed, Bauhaus output would eventually span architecture, graphic design, interior design, art, typography and industrial design â the latter being entirely fitting for a theory that attempted to marry individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production revolutionizing capitalism. As with the EU's Green Deal, these were high ideals applied to necessary situations. As Gropius put it, "An object is defined by its nature. In order, then, to design it to function correctly â a container, a chair, or a house â one must first of all study its nature: For it must serve its purpose perfectly, that is, it must fulfil its function usefully, be durable, economical, and 'beautiful.'"  That last word perhaps referenced William Morris, the 19th-century English designer whose golden rule was "Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful." For Bauhaus, there was no need to decide between beauty and use, between function and form: the everyday could be rendered sublime through the right marriage of utility and appearance, usually stripped down and presented without artifice.Widely popular across Europe and the world, Bauhaus design was eventually reflected in everything from Wassily chairs to Olivetti typewriters and, most lastingly, Modernist architecture. That the EU has evoked its name is perhaps designed to recall a brief time when the whole continent was united in the thrilling possibilities of a sleek new future with more opportunity than threat. There is, however, a sad end to the Bauhaus tale. In 1933, by which time it had relocated to Berlin, the Bauhaus was closed down by the newly elected Nazi party, for which it represented cosmopolitanism, liberalism and degeneracy. The Nazis had a very different aesthetic, a more traditional and reactionary Romanticist throwback to an illusory golden age. Adolf Hitler encouraged his favored architect Albert Speer to concoct designs for the reconstruction of Berlin as a New Rome, an aesthetically illiterate toy box of domes and triumphal arches, which was never to see the light of day. History proves that not every overarching architectural plan is well received or even well conceived. But in throwing open its doors to the best of new ideas, hopefully the EU's new Bauhaus will help to future-proof the continent's building stock for our new millennium â while putting in place ecological targets to make sure it isn't our last.Grand architectural plans are not always viewed well by history. What some might herald as triumphant regeneration can seem to others like a triumphalist celebration of power; well-meaning schemes to clean up deprived areas can often sweep away what made them vibrant neighborhoods to begin with. There is also the question of taste and style, and the inherent problems when changing fashions are applied not to clothing but to buildings, which should be rather more permanent but are often victim to the sweeping statements of incoming ideologues. Infamously, the Modernist-influenced reconstruction of social housing in the third quarter of the 20th century in the UK especially raised unloved "streets in the sky" by razing the sort of centrally located terraced houses that are now highly prized, and therefore highly expensive, as family homes.   However, those allegedly Modernist high-rises owed much less to architectural idealism than they did to manufacturing opportunism, in particular the cheap modular techniques keenly adopted by cash-conscious authorities. When cheap construction caused expensive problems â many 1960s projects have required extensive renovation or expensive replacement â the blame was laid upon the idea rather than the practice, the form rather than the content. It needn't be that way, and perhaps the impending "green" renovation of Europe's ageing building stock can be based upon more permanent foundations, conceived with the longest-term plans in mind. Reconstruction timeOn September 16, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the EU's new Green Deal would have high ideals. While one major strand of the ecological plan â to cut carbon emissions by 55 percent before 2030 â was reducing vehicle emissions, Von der Leyen was also eyeing the very architecture of Europe. "Our buildings generate 40 percent of our emissions," she noted. "They need to become less wasteful, less expensive and more sustainable. We know that the construction sector can even be turned from a carbon source into a carbon sink, if organic building materials like wood and smart technologies like AI are applied."The aims are eye-wateringly large. According to the EU's stocktaking, "more than 220 million buildings, representing approximately 85 percent of the building stock, were built before 2001." Europe has a lot of buildings, but the European Union has a lot of money to throw at them â the cost of the Green Deal has been estimated as at least $1.18 trillion as Europe aims to be the first climate-neutral continent by 2050.   One proposed schedule for the "Renovation Wave" of retrofitting buildings would update 2 percent of the continent's building stock every year. Building work on such a huge scale represents an enormous risk â or opportunity. As Von der Leyen said: "This is not just an environmental or economic project, it needs to be a new cultural project for Europe." Luckily, Europe is rich in cultural history, and has done this sort of thing before â which is where the Bauhaus idea comes in. "Every movement has its own look and feel," said Von der Leyen, "and we need to give our systemic change its own distinct aesthetic â to match style with sustainability. "This is why we will set up a new European Bauhaus â a co-creation space where architects, artists, students, engineers [and] designers work together to make that happen." A 'new Bauhaus'But what exactly is this new Bauhaus? According to Von der Leyen: "The New European Bauhaus movement is intended to be a bridge between the world of science and technology and the world of art and culture. It is about a new European Green Deal aesthetic combining good design with sustainability."Wednesday's parliamentary question-and-answer session attempted to set out more details, although some of the answers raised yet more questions. The new Bauhaus "will be an interdisciplinary project, co-steered by an advisory board of external experts including scientists, architects, designers, artists, planners and civil society that will create experimental spaces where art, culture, science and technology can imagine, test and demonstrate new solutions."So far, so inclusive. The expansive ideals will go across multiple disciplines: "All Bauhaus projects would deal with the built environment as a whole but would focus on different aspects, such as climate challenges, accessibility, social cohesion, digital construction, sustainable bio-resources etc... and be in different countries."  As such, the new Bauhaus is described as an "accelerator for affordable and aesthetically promising green and digital solutions, technologies and products." Welcoming proposals, the Commission will "conduct a broad participatory co-creation process."For the time being, then, it is something of a talking shop as it attempts to create a unified ethos and aesthetic from the notoriously competitive world of architecture. There may be a lot of discussion before we start to see a style emerging. But that's not to say the project is heading into a slow death by eternal committee: there is a timeline, and there are even construction plans set in stone, if not environmentally unfriendly concrete. That "broad participatory co-creation process" will only last until summer 2021, with "delivery" starting in the second half of 2021. Intriguingly, the Commission mentions "the setting up of a network of five founding Bauhaus[es] in 2022." With further expansion possible: "In a second wave, further Bauhaus[es] can be added across the EU and even globally."At this point, the New Bauhaus steps off the drawing board and into the real world. It is described as "a forum for discussion, a space for art and culture, an experimentation lab, an accelerator, a hub for global networks and experts, a contact point for citizens interested in the topic."It seems that the new-Bauhaus idea is not simply a useful branding tool â a quick comparison to a well-known previous conceptual movement â but a reference to an actual building, or buildings. And that's entirely fitting for the heritage of the name. Unlike, say, Art Nouveau or Futurism, the original Bauhaus was literally a school: an art school, founded in Weimar in the aftermath of a world-shaking event.  The old BauhausThat Bauhaus (German for "building house") is now identified as a minimalist style is somewhat ironic given the widespread aims of its founders. Although it was founded by architect Walter Gropius â a year after the end of World War I in 1919 â the Staatliches Bauhaus art school always combined fine arts with crafts and espoused a Gesamtkunstwerk ("comprehensive artwork"), a common aesthetic that intended to unify all the arts. Indeed, Bauhaus output would eventually span architecture, graphic design, interior design, art, typography and industrial design â the latter being entirely fitting for a theory that attempted to marry individual artistic vision with the principles of mass production revolutionizing capitalism. As with the EU's Green Deal, these were high ideals applied to necessary situations. As Gropius put it, "An object is defined by its nature. In order, then, to design it to function correctly â a container, a chair, or a house â one must first of all study its nature: For it must serve its purpose perfectly, that is, it must fulfil its function usefully, be durable, economical, and 'beautiful.'"  That last word perhaps referenced William Morris, the 19th-century English designer whose golden rule was "Have nothing in your house that you do not know to be useful, or believe to be beautiful."

You may know Luosifen (stinky sour snail noodles). But you may have never imagined KFC will sell Luosifen someday.KFC China has announced the launch of a range of pre-packaged, fast-cooking items categorized as "Kaifengcai," which include chicken Luosifen, chicken breast and chicken soup.Starting October 12, KFC stores in 23 Chinese cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and Shenzhen, have been selling chicken breast and chicken soup, while chicken Luosifen won't be available until October 26.According to KFC China, the "Kaifengcai" series is only designed for take-away and not dine-in. It's aimed at "inviting young people to enjoy hands-on cooking pleasure" via dishes' self-heating packaging, according to the KFC announcement.Originating in Liuzhou, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, in the 1970s, Luosifen served as a cheap street snack that people outside of the city knew little about. It was not until 2012 when a hit Chinese food documentary, "A Bite of China," featured it and it became a household name.Combining the elements of dishes made by Han people with those of the Miao and Dong ethnic groups, Luosifen comprises rice noodles boiled with pickled bamboo shoots, dried turnip, fresh vegetables and peanuts in spicy river snail soup. It is sour, spicy, salty, hot and stinky after being boiled.There's been a "fever of Luosifen" in the catering industry in recent years, both inside and outside of China. Many food manufacturers have launched products with Luosifen flavor, such as mooncake and hotpot.Meanwhile, Luosifen worth around 7.5 million yuan (about $1.1 million) was exported from Liuzhou from January to June this year. That's eight times the total export value in 2019.KFC's move marks its latest step in the localization of its menus in China."As a leading fast-food chain, KFC is really quick in making products catering to local flavors. Luosifen is one of the most popular foods among young Chinese people. The KFC certainly hopes to attract more customers through this move," said Zhu Danpeng, an analyst in the Chinese food industry.You may know KFC. You may know Luosifen (stinky sour snail noodles).

earth around 150 million years ago was sold at a Paris auction house on Tuesday for 3 million euros ($3.52 million).The skeleton of the Allosaurus dinosaur, dug up in the U.S. state of Wyoming three years ago, went to an unnamed foreign buyer for well in excess of the 1 million euro starting price."This is a high grade specimen," said Iacopo Briano, a palaeontologist who acted as a consultant to the Binoche et Giquello auction house which conducted the sale.The specimen is unusual because it is so complete: around 70 percent of the bones are present, and they were found aligned with each other, making it easier to reconnect them during the restoration process.The restored skeleton stands 3.5 meters (11 feet) high and 10 meters long. The ribcage bears the marks of what the auctioneers said may have been an attack by a rival Allosaurus or a predator.(Cover: A skeleton of an Allosaurus dinosaur is on display at Drouot auction house on October 12, 2020, in Paris, France. /CFP)The

He also answered questions on creativity in filmmaking from the press.What do you think of the impact of the pandemic on filmmakers?I believe that some filmmakers will pay attention to public health topics in the future. The pandemic has an impact on all aspects of our lives, not just filmmaking. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, I felt that I and the people around me were very healthy, but now that we are so vulnerable with the pandemic, I hope that with the advancement of science and technology, we can better deal with the pandemic.Most of your movies are related to daily life, does this have anything to do with your perspective on the world?When I recall things in life, there may be some things that are repetitive, not so attractive to put in movies. Sometimes when a small crisis occurs, it will be meaningful to transform it into a movie theme.For example, two people are having dinner in a restaurant and chatting. This is very daily and not interesting to put into a movie. But for example, these two people are a couple and are about to divorce. And this is the last dinner before the divorce. That would be something dramatic enough to put into a movie. It is different from an ordinary dinner, and can convey a meaning.What is your general creative process?I usually have an idea in my mind. It might be a picture or a fragment that appears in my mind. Many times I start with a very small idea. It might stay in my mind for a long time. Some ideas are constantly changing and maturing. If I think these ideas or fragments are suitable for film expression, I will enrich them and turn them into movies. For example, this idea is related to social concerns, can reflect some social problems, and psychologically caters to the needs of the audience, I will turn it into a movie. But some ideas may only have meaning from one angle, and I will not turn this idea into a movie. When creating a screenplay, I will first describe the outline of the story, and I will gradually enrich it during the creation. In the beginning, I would not imagine the end of the film, the screenplay creation would take a long time, I wouldn't start filming before the screenplay is matured. For example, I have an idea of a young man traveling to northern Iran, he might meet a lot of people, and many things might happen. At the beginning, I would not specifically imagine what things would happen, and who is he going to encounter. I would enrich these when writing the screenplay.What is realistic cinema?The word realistic itself has very rich meanings. Some movies are called realistic movies, which are just superficially realistic, not actually realistic. After I worked in the film industry for a while, my understanding of realistic cinema is to pay attention to people's daily lives. This is realistic cinema. I discussed this with directors in China before, for example, a friend of yours called you and said that he hadnât seen you for a long time and wanted to have tea with you. You were very happy when you received the call and you guys chatted over tea happily, he said that he wanted to start a journey. This is daily life, there is no conflict or contradiction, this is not a movie story. But for example, letâs say this friend died suddenly in a car accident during the trip, elements for a movie came into being. We need to find usable fragments from our lives and make artistic creations.You have experiences directing in French and Spanish. How do you master foreign language creation?In my films, I try to show life in Iran as much as possible. Creating films in Persian, expressing the problems of our society is simpler. If I go to other countries, my habits are different, languages are different, and social environments are different. I have made two films abroad but I still feel that art films are closely integrated with society and culture. When I create films for my own country and for my own audience, the job is simpler. In other countries, there might be creative difficulties.How do you deal with the difference between director and audience's perspective over a movie?These two perspectives are difficult to separate. As film directors, we always think about the audiences. Actually, we are the first audiences of our own films. I don't judge in movies, I just convey. For example, in The Past, we have two protagonists, an Iranian and a French. I am an Iranian. In my creation, some of my emotions are closer to the Iranian role. I know how he would think. But for the French, it is not that close. But in the creation of the screenplay, I try not to favor anyone, and do not judge anyone's behavior. The audience should be the one to judge. I will not give audiences my judgment during the filming.How do you balance the commercial success of a film and the pursuit of artistic expression? Movies need to have commercial success on the one hand, and the pursuit of artistic expression on the other. Many artistic films are not liked by the audiences, unfortunately. In many cases, the audiences and the professional film critics are not the same group. Some of my own films are fortunately welcomed by the audiences. I think there are two reasons: one is drama and the other is reality. Both of these can make a film interesting and attractive.Some artistic films have weak plot connections, and the director needs to connect the plots in a realistic narrative so that the audience can relate to their lives in order to attract them. Plots are like pearls in the ocean, we need to string them well to make it work. Arrange them randomly would make the audience feel that these things cannot happen in their daily life, so they won't like them. Expressing life and be full of drama, at the same time, can attract ordinary audiences. And only with dramatic plots that reflect social issues can we achieve artistic success.Asghar Farhadi was born in 1972 in Iran. He became interested in cinema when he was a teenager and started his education in filmmaking by joining the Youth Cinema Society of Esfahan in 1986, where he made 8mm and 16mm short films. He received his Bachelors in Theater from the School of Dramatic Arts at Tehran University in 1998 and his Masters in Stage Direction a few years later.Farhadi made his directorial debut with "Dance In The Dust" in 2003, and a year later, he made "Beautiful City." His third film, "Fireworks Wednesday," won the Gold Hugo at the 2006 Chicago International Film Festival. His fourth film, "About Elly," made in 2009, won the Silver Bear for Best Director at 59 Berlin International Film Festival as well as Best Picture at Tribeca Film Festival. This movie was also Iran's official submission for the Best Foreign Language Film competition of Academy Awards in 2009. His next film, "A Separation," became a sensation in 2011. It got critical acclaim inside and outside Iran. Roger Ebert called it "the best picture of the year," and it received both the Golden Bear and the Silver Bear for Best Actor and Best Actress at the Berlin International Film Festival. The film also won Best Foreign Language Film from The Boston Society of Film Critics, the Chicago and Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle, the National Board of Review, the Golden Globes, the Cesar Award, the Independent Spirit Award, and ultimately the Academy Award in the Best Foreign Language Film of the Year, making him the first Iranian filmmaker ever to win an Oscar.Farhadi made his sixth movie "The Past" in France. Lead actress Berenice Bejo won the best actress award at the Cannes Film Festival. "The Past"  was also nominated for a Golden Globe for the Best Foreign Language Film and won the National Board of Reviews' Best Foreign Language Film award. The film was also nominated in five categories of the Cesar Film Festival, including Directing, Best Script and Best Actress. His 2016 movie, "The Salesman," won the Best Screenplay Award at the 69th Cannes Film Festival and brought home the second Oscar for Iran in the Best Foreign Language Film category. Two-time Oscar-winning Iranian director Asghar Farhadi shared his knowledge with young Chinese directors in an online masterclass during the 7th Silk Road International Film Festival (SRIFF), focusing on realistic cinema in his creative works. He also answered questions on creativity in filmmaking from the press.What do you think of the impact of the pandemic on filmmakers?I believe that some filmmakers will pay attention to public health topics in the future. The pandemic has an impact on all aspects of our lives, not just filmmaking. Before the outbreak of the pandemic, I felt that I and the people around me were very healthy, but now that we are so vulnerable with the pandemic, I hope that with the advancement of science and technology, we can better deal with the pandemic.Most of your movies are related to daily life, does this have anything to do with your perspective on the world?When I recall things in life, there may be some things that are repetitive, not so attractive to put in movies. Sometimes when a small crisis occurs, it will be meaningful to transform it into a movie theme.For example, two people are having dinner in a restaurant and chatting. This is very daily and not interesting to put into a movie. But for example, these two people are a couple and are about to divorce. And this is the last dinner before the divorce. That would be something dramatic enough to put into a movie. It is different from an ordinary dinner, and can convey a meaning.What is your general creative process?I usually have an idea in my mind. It might be a picture or a fragment that appears in my mind. Many times I start with a very small idea. It might stay in my mind for a long time. Some ideas are constantly changing and maturing. If I think these ideas or fragments are suitable for film expression, I will enrich them and turn them into movies.

An exhibition in Beijing unravels its mystery and history.These are eye-witnesses of the evolution of Chinese civilization from the third to the ninth century. Rather than curated by chronology or geography, the 200 or so ceramic objects are arranged into four subjects: Anchoret, Sutra, Alchemy and Lions. Each concept represents a significant cultural, social or historical aspect of the period."Anchoret" refers to powerful and influential families who had for generations held important official positions in the Wei, Jin and Northern and Southern dynasties. At the beginning of the third century, the scholar-officer clan, who failed in its pursuit of the official career, grew skeptical of Confucian ethics. "They began pursuing a more philosophical, seclusive way of living, advocating for individual liberation and spiritual freedom.

As a result, Buddhist images were highly recognized in ceramic art during this period.In ancient times, most ceramic objects served as tools of production, daily utensils or funeral items. They were not endowed with aesthetic values like they are today. But this gradually changed as techniques developed.

We cannot wait for that first downbeat!" she said.The Phil said it estimates a net loss of approximately 10 million U.S. dollars in the most recent fiscal year, as well as a loss of 20 million dollars in ticket revenue from the canceled 2020-21 season.Nearly half of the administrative staff has been furloughed or laid off, and staff making more than 100,000 dollars a year have pay cuts up to 30 percent.A Philharmonic spokesperson told AFP the organization is in negotiations with musicians but declined to comment on specifics per its agreement with the union.Currently symphony musicians are receiving 75 percent of their base pay, about 2,200 dollars a week. Those who normally earn salaries above base are receiving 35 percent of overscale.The prolonged lull at Lincoln Center's David Geffen Hall, the Manhattan stage where the Phil performs, could provide time for long-planned renovations.The acoustic overhaul of the facility first opened in 1962 was slated for opening in May 2022, with an estimated cost of 550 million dollars.The New York Philharmonic has canceled all shows through mid-June 2021 over the coronavirus pandemic, the first time the 178-year-old institution has been forced to scrap an entire season.The famed symphony said it made the decision â the latest blow to live music, coming after similar moves by Broadway and the city's Metropolitan Opera â on the advice of health officials.The Phil vowed to continue offering free digital content and said it would announce an expanded winter and spring orchestra streaming series at a later date.The company also said in the spring it would reboot its newly minted outdoor pop-up series, which found success this fall and features small ensembles who play free shows in parks and on street corners throughout the city on weekends."The cancellation of an entire New York Philharmonic season is not only unprecedented â it is devastating, both in its impact on the morale of musicians and audiences, and in its profound economic consequences," said the institution's President and CEO Deborah Borda, adding there was "no other choice.""This will not be a silent season, and we eagerly anticipate September 2021, when the entire Orchestra can reunite with our audience.

The trend for colored stones has increased as an asset class by the super rich in recent years.Mined by Russian diamond producer Alrosa, the 14.83-carat diamond was cut from the largest pink crystal ever found in Russia, Sotheby's said."The occurrence of pink diamonds in nature is extremely rare in any size. Only one percent of all pink diamonds are larger than 10-carats," said Gary Schuler, worldwide chairman of Sotheby's jewelry division.Naturally colored diamonds occur because they posses a particular lattice structure that refracts light to produce colored, rather than white, stones.Pink diamonds are both rare and aesthetically highly prized by collectors, analysts say.The gem is being shown in Singapore and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Taiwan region before being auctioned in Geneva on November 11.An extremely rare, vivid purple-pink diamond mined in Russia is expected to fetch up to $38 million when it goes under the hammer on November 11, the auction house Sotheby's said on Monday.The oval gem, which is named after the Russian ballet "The Spirit of the Rose," is the largest of its kind to be offered at auction.

Adapted from real events and told through the lens of volleyball legend Lang Ping, it offers a unique glimpse into some of the contentious issues that have compounded her complicated legacy.And therein lies the novelty."'Leap' is distinguished from other patriotic movies in the way that it treats characters in a rather refreshing way while injecting the story with fresh narratives and far-reaching hints," Jing, a movie reviewer who runs his own review website, told CGTN.In recent years, China's entertainment industry has been flooded with movies featuring historical events effusing patriotic sentiments. Making billions in box-office revenues, these movies are beloved by Chinese cinema-goers.While some of these are repetitive, they serve a purpose. "We do need these movies to convey some messages," said Li Jing, another freelance movie reviewer.But "stories need to be told in a way that characters are fully formed," Li explained. "'Leap' is not perfect, but it shows the effort of focusing the narrative on an intricate character."A standard Chinese patriotic movie tends to emphasize individual sacrifices for the collective, but "Leap" did not follow that path, according to Jing. "I believe Peter Ho-sun Chan, the movie director, was more keen on examining the reconciliation between individual fulfillment and collective interests. It transcends the idea that war-time blockbusters are the only type of movies that audiences like."Lang was an indefatigable player in the national women's team when China was just opening up to the outside world in the 1980s. At a time when patriotism was running high and winning sports events on the global stage signified tremendous national pride, Lang and her team secured thrilling victories â including a world championship title and Olympic gold â that still reverberate across the country.After taking up a coaching career in the U.S. and successfully guiding the U.S. national team to notable victories, she returned to China and was determined to lead the struggling Chinese national team back to its peak. But by then, she was no longer just a patriot elated by winning glory for her country, but had become a seasoned, reserved coach accustomed to both victory or defeat.And "Leap" touches on the contentious theme underlying that change: her questioning of China's sports system, where top athletes are required to devote all their energy to their sport but are not prepared for life after their career is over."'Leap' not only acknowledges the fading trend of patriotism in contemporary China, a cause for the loss of spirit that once motivated athletes of older generations, but also hints at Lang's change in attitude towards volleyball as well as the drawbacks of China's sports system," Jing said. "In this respect, Chan approaches these topics with full honesty."Lang suffered permanent injuries due to strenuous training in her early career as an athlete. Even now, she still holds a disability certificate in the U.S.. But before she left China for an overseas coaching career, she was allegedly refused reimbursement for some costly medical bills by the Chinese volleyball association."Chan is very adept at presenting individualism as the product of our time. One of his signature movies in the 1990s, 'Comrades: Almost a Love Story,' depicts a woman who puts her self-interest above others," said Li."In 'Leap,' we can see the unraveling of the same discussion. Though bound to offend some in the audience, this is the sharp reflection of reality," Li added."Leap" follows a number of other bold and thought-provoking films that have come out in recent years.The 2018 movie "The Shadow Play" by Lou Ye took a sharp look at the pervasive practices of forced relocation. "Dying to survive" by Wen Muye, also released in 2018, offers a critical view of China's medical system."Dearest," another one of Chan's works, provocatively dove into the issues surrounding child abduction and did not shun away from the problematic ramifications of China's birth control policies."These movies turned out to be more popular and often received good reviews," noted Jing."Leap" topped the Chinese box office in the first week of its release and has already made 700 million yuan ($104.19 million) since then.Despite speculation that China's censorship system is tightening its grip on the movie industry, a growing number of movie makers have been toeing the line of what is acceptable to the film censors.Lou Ye, director of "The Shadow Play," is known to have challenged the censorship system for years. One of his principles for filmmaking, as he himself has stated, is "not to give up on making movies that push the boundaries, as long as they don't cross the line."These directors are feeding new blood into China's movie industry.Long known for its patriotic movies and action blockbusters, China's film industry has lately witnessed a more invigorating trend powered by poignant, captivating stories."Leap," the story of China's Olympic winning women's volleyball team, which made its domestic debut last month, is one movie representing this new chapter.

In 2015, China established the Girls' and Women's Education Award with UNESCO, and Peng mentioned that there are millions of people who devote their life for the education of girls and women in China.  Zhang Guimei is one of them. She is a female teacher who has taught in the poor mountainous areas of Southwest China's Yunnan Province for over 40 years. She established the first full-tuition-free girl high school in China, which helps many young girls from poverty-stricken families receive education. This year, 1.5 billion students have been forced to suspend classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Peng, and this impact on girls is particularly pronounced. We need to find ways to help those girls get back to school so that they won't be left behind due to the coronavirus pandemic. Sixty-three percent of illiterate adults around the world are women, said Peng, and the education of girls and women is of great benefit to the present and the future. China will continue to work with UNESCO to ensure the success of the Girls' and Women's Education Awards from 2021 to 2025, and make greater contributions to promoting girls' and women's education and achieving the Sustainable Development Goals, Peng added. Audrey Azoulay, director-general of UNESCO, thanked the Chinese government for supporting the establishment of Girls' and Women's Education Awards. The UNESCO Prize for Girls' and Women's Education honors outstanding and innovative contributions made by individuals, institutions and organizations to advance girls' and women's education. China's First Lady Peng Liyuan, also United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) special envoy for the advancement of girls' and women's education, sent a congratulatory message to the award of UNESCO via a video on October 12. In her message, Peng expressed congratulations to prize-winners from Sri Lanka and Kenya.

Even though this represents a fall of around 20 percent compared with last year, it's being seen as a positive step for the country's tourism industry, which has been particularly hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic.The eight-day October holiday, a combination of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day, was the first opportunity for many people in China to get together with their families since COVID-19 struck in January.On October 1, train and air travel saw record numbers for a single day since the pandemic began, according to figures from travel service provider Trip.com Group. However, the overall number of trips made so far this year only accounts for 79 percent of the total for the same period of 2019, China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism said in a statement on Thursday.Michelle Iruiam, a foreign affairs specialist in Beijing, traveled to Guilin and Yangshuo during the break. She said that overall, people seemed excited to be able to move around and travel again. "I expected it to be less busy, but it seemed to be on par with other years that I have traveled for the October holiday," she said.Prevention and control measures, which have become part of daily life in China, were still much in evidence at airports, railway stations and tourist attractions. According to Iruiam, "Everyone was required to wear masks in subways, buses, airports and planes, but otherwise it was not as strictly enforced as I imagined it would be." She added that travelers were required to download various "health kit" apps for different cities, but this didn't create problems, as long as the tourists could understand Chinese.In light of continuing concerns surrounding coronavirus, many people decided to spend Golden Week closer to home. Jason Huth, an English teacher in Beijing, was one who decided not to travel during the holiday. "I chose to stay for a few reasons; partly because I had just got back to Beijing a few weeks ago after being stuck abroad since Chinese New Year, partly because my school strongly advised teachers not to travel too far away from Beijing due to fears of having to quarantine upon return."Many international schools and companies advised staff against travel during the break. Aletta Magrieta Strauss, a Beijing-based art teacher, said she thought this was reasonable. "If there was an outbreak and I had to quarantine as a result, work would not cover the cost. They (international schools) have already lost a lot of money and are still trying to get staff back into China."With many people having extra money to spend due to not traveling earlier in the year, and with the onus being on safety and comfort, high-end hotels saw a boom in business. Of all hotel bookings made on Trip.com during the October holiday, four- and five-star accommodation accounted for nearly half. It's anticipated that the effect will be lasting, as more people get used to the idea of "luxury staycations."This year's October holiday saw a resurgence in domestic tourism, with 637 million trips being recorded in eight days.

Soprano Zhang Liping and baritone He Leiming, both natives of Wuhan, sang with the Chorus of the Wuhan Conservatory of Music and Beijing Music Association Chorus.Earlier this year, the people of Wuhan and of the rest of China fought the coronavirus pandemic with solidarity and eventually won the battle. "We need to remember this time, reflect the disaster, respect lives and honor civilization," said Zou Ye, who composed the eight-movement symphony."'Dedicated to 2020' is the first large-scale (symphony) work paying tribute to the fight against the coronavirus epidemic," said Yu Long, chairman of the Beijing Music Festival Art Committee."The musicians of the Wuhan Philharmonic Orchestra were engaged in non-musical community work during the epidemic. Each musician is like a soldier. Musicians turn musical instruments into weapons on the stage and provide spiritual support for people. They were also soldiers fighting on the front line of the epidemic," he added.Beijing Music Festival hits both offline and onlineUnder the theme "The Music Must Go On," the Beijing Music Festival is offering 20 offline performances and 240 hours of non-stop online audio and video programs through the mobile application BMF Club.This year marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of German composer Ludwig van Beethoven and to commemorate the musician, 10 young award-winning violinists, including Xie Haoming, Chen Yige and Jiang Yiliang, have been invited to present 10 of Beethoven's violin sonatas on stage from October 12 to 14.The online offerings, a new addition in the wake of the pandemic, include over 2,000 pieces of music as well as specially-made programs.On each of the festival's 10 nights, the program "Nessun dorma" will invite a Chinese opera singer to introduce some great operas spanning from the Baroque period to the 21st century.

Let art and artists get the respect they deserve," he added.The festival will close on October 20 with a concert themed "We Were Born in 2000" to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the China Philharmonic Orchestra.

The most dominant is a group called the Han, who make up more than 90 percent of the mainland's population.Traditionally, the Han people had their own distinctive way of life, including the way they dressed. The type of clothing they wear is known as Hanfu, but some also call it Han clothing. The traditional clothing system of Han people is today divided into two phases: ancient and modern.Ancient Hanfu dates back to the time of Yellow Emperor, which is about 4,000 years ago. It had been developing until about 300 or 400 years ago, when the Qing Dynasty's policy on hair and dress code intervened.Later on, it was around the beginning of the 20th century when the country started moving more towards Western-style clothing. Moving forward, modern Hanfu styles refer to outfits that inherit the basic designs of Hanfu, along with more modern elements.These eight words sum up its characteristics and what makes a Hanfu. In Chinese, it says "Ping Zhong Jiao You, Kuan Tuan He Ying."Ping means flat. One of the key elements of Hanfu is that it doesn't have shoulder lines, meaning the outfit uses just one plain cut of fabric.Zhong means centralized. The cutting and tailoring abide by the rule of symmetrical tailoring and stitching.Jiao means the elements of Hanfu are designed to cross and overlap, upholding a belief in traditional Chinese culture: the balance of Yin and Yang.The word "You" is stressed, meaning everything must move to the right, including how the front is closed.The fifth one is Kuan, meaning width. Hanfu outfits have loose-fitting upper sleeves and bottom. It reminds the wearer to walk with grace and to observe etiquettes.Tuan and He refer to the edges and sleeves. The edges have to be neat and clean with no dangling threads, while the sleeves should come together and meet.Last, but not least is the embellishment.

The route not only linked Xinjiang to other areas of China, but also boosted the tourism and economic development in cities along the route.Read more: High-speed railway line speeds up Xinjiang development(With input from Xinhua)(Cover: A new bullet train to Xi'an sets off from Urumqi, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, October 11, 2020. /CFP)A new bullet train linking Urumqi, capital of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with the ancient city of Xi'an made its debut on Sunday, ending the history of no direct bullet train service between the two major northwestern Chinese cities, according to China Railway Xi'an Group Co., Ltd.With a top speed of 250 kilometers per hour, the newly launched bullet train reduces the travel time between the two cities to around 13 hours."The travel time from Urumqi to Xi'an has been reduced by more than 12 hours, in some case 21 hours at most, offering a new and convenient option for travelers," said Chen Jing, the vice director of the Ticket Management Office of the Urumqi Railway Bureau. The new train service will benefit the tourism sector and boost economic and cultural exchanges along the route, contributing to dynamism in economy and culture, as well as the opening-up of northwest China, said Zhang Baotong, head of Shaanxi Province Economic and Cultural Research.Over the years, China has launched several new high-speed railway routes in the northwestern part of the country in line with the new national train operation map to facilitate faster travel in the region. Xinjiang's first outbound high-speed railway route linking the region to Lanzhou City, capital of Gansu Province, was launched six years ago.

The elderly want to live at home. However, while their children are willing to take care of them, they suffer from lack of time and energy. Virtual nursing homes seem to be providing a solution to the problem.With just one phone call, the nursing home can provide various services for the elderly at home, from buying vegetables and cooking to cleaning, from massage services to accompanying the sick, so that the elderly can enjoy "personal customized elderly care" without leaving home. In the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District, Lanzhou City, Gansu Province, there is not a single bed, but it can serve tens of thousands of elderly people.An "information and home care service" platform and an "intelligent elderly care informatization" management platform have been created to incorporate registered elderly people, regardless of their location, according to Qin Tiantian, director of the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District. The system can provide professional and standardized home care services in a timely and accurate manner through big data collection."Although virtual nursing homes are virtual, the services are actually in place," said Qin. "As of now, more than 133,700 elderly people have been registered and hospitalized, and the total number of services has reached 13.79 million.""The combination of internet technology and elderly care services can not only update offline service maps, day care center monitoring and other content in real time, but also retrieve long-term monitoring data such as blood glucose and blood pressure of the elderly," said Liu Mingzhe, a technical engineer at the virtual nursing home in Chengguan District, adding that smart devices such as infrared sensors and voice-activated alarms can also realize "cloud monitoring" for the elderly in their virtual nursing homes."Different from traditional nursing homes, virtual nursing homes are an old-age care service platform built on information technology," said Pan Helin, professor at the Digital Economy Research Institute of Zhongnan University of Economics and Law, further pointing out that virtual nursing homes are generally led by the government and integrate nursing institutions and communities."Elderly care resources such as medical service centers and housekeeping services provide various professional services for the elderly through remote diagnosis and treatment and home-based services," he added.The emergence of virtual nursing homes is a result of adapting to the country's social needs â a high degree of population aging and a stage of rapid development. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, by the end of 2018, China's population of elderly people over 60 years old reached 249 million, accounting for 17.9 percent of the total population, and the pension situation is relatively severe."The comparative advantages of developing virtual nursing homes are very obvious. It can realize the centralized, precise and efficient supply of decentralized nursing resources, which is an effective choice for my country to deal with the impact of population aging," Pan said.Virtual nursing homes are not unexpected. As early as 2007, China's first virtual nursing home care service center was born in Gusu District, Suzhou City, Jiangsu Province. It mainly provides home-based care services for the elderly, especially empty nesters and the destitute. Today, after more than 10 years of development, Suzhou has formed a mature virtual pension model, which has been replicated and promoted throughout Jiangsu.In recent years, some places are also exploring different forms of virtual nursing homes. For example, Shanghai has vigorously developed an "embedded" elderly care system, creating a "15-minute home elderly care service circle" in urban areas, and launched new types of community elderly care institutions."Virtual nursing homes are all new things in the international arena, lacking mature experience reference, and relying more on our own exploration," Pan said."Current virtual nursing homes are also facing excessive reliance on government purchases, insufficient market activity, and shortage of talents. The bottleneck is that the construction of virtual nursing homes has a long way to go from one to many and from many to excellent," he added.Pan believes that it is necessary to improve relevant laws and regulations, standardize the development of the industry, strengthen the supervision of this new business format, and at the same time, under the principle of inclusiveness and prudence, enhance the tolerance of related enterprises and promote the development of the industry.Some other experts also mentioned that the key difference between virtual nursing homes and general housekeeping services lies in their professionalism and orientation. It is recommended to speed up the training of compound talents with skills in geriatrics, rehabilitation, nursing, psychology, and management, and expand the career development space of senior care service professionals.As the degree of population aging deepens, "virtual nursing homes" â a new model of home care that makes full use of social resources â are becoming the choice of more and more elderly people in China.The Chinese National Development and Reform Commission and 22 other departments jointly issued the "Implementation Opinions on Promoting Capacity Expansion and Quality Improvement of Consumption and Accelerating the Formation of a Strong Domestic Market" on March 13, 2020, proposing to vigorously develop the "internet + social services" consumption model and support the development of community-based virtual nursing homes.Over the past 10 years, virtual nursing homes have been promoted in many places in the country, exhibiting expanding service groups, diversified service content, and prominent intelligent features.

Domestic tourism revenue recovered 69.9 percent year on year.The reports released by several online travel platforms showed that the homestay inns were "difficult to book" during the holiday, and the popularity of the homestay industry even exceeded the same period last year.Judging from the occupancy trend, September 29 and 30 were the busiest days for homestay inns. Starting from the night of October 1, the occupancy rate showed explosive growth, and reached its peak on October 2 and lasted until October 6. The popularity of homestaysAccording to a report released by Tujia Homestay, China's short-term lodging rental platform, homestay bookings for this year's National Day Golden Week recovered to 95 percent from the same period last year. Among them, homestays in the countryside performed well, with platform booking volume reaching 120 percent from the same period last year.For example, the Huang He Su Ji hotel groups, a luxury homestay alliance comprised of five major domestic hotel operators, in Zhongwei, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, were fully occupied for the entire holiday."All the tourists who want to go abroad for holidays due to the COVID-19 pandemic have shifted to domestic, so high-end holiday products have been trending this year," said Ma Li, co-founder of Huang He Su Ji.Read more: Travelogue: Luxury hotel group helps transform desert into destination"The occupancy rate of Huang He Su Ji kept 100 percent from May to now, and visitors usually booked two months in advance almost, which is completely higher than the same period last year," added Ma.Qian Jiliang, president of Moganshan's homestay association, also told ThePaper that the average occupancy rate of homestays was about 90 percent during National Day last year, and more than 95 percent during this year's National Day, up five percentage points from the same period last year.Of course, there are occupancy rates that fell short of expectations.According to the ThePaper, the average occupancy rate at a homestay in Lijiang, a popular tourist destination, during National Day this year has been about 70 percent to 75 percent, according to an insider familiar with the Lijiang's homestay industry."The situation in Lijiang is much worse than last year," the person said. "I think it's still the overall impact of the epidemic. There were also uncertain orders before the festival, and many orders were returned," the insider added.

"We had expected to pay tribute to the booming 1920s in the film history and the birth of experimental film through the Pingyao International Film Festival after 100 years," said Jia Zhangke, Chinese film director and the festival's founder, recalling his last year's plan for this year's festival.But the plan was disrupted, as China's film industry was forced to shut down for 178 days due to the coronavirus pandemic. "As an international film festival held after the epidemic, we want to give a film's answer to the public health event," said Jia, "The festival is a manifestation that Chinese film industry workers insist on producing good works despite all odds and having dialogue with the world."That's how the theme of this year's festival, "Only Filmâ¦" comes. Just as it puts on the festival's official website, "Only films can make the darkness bright."Reduced size but high standard remainedAlthough with a reduced size, more than 50 films will be screened in the festival's five sections. Among them, 43 percent are for the world premiere, 89 percent for the Asian premiere, and all of them for the national premiere.The opening film "This is Life" is an anthology of a number of short videos, many of which are filmed by common people about their lives via their phones. The special presentation "So Far So Close," produced by Chinese director Zhang Yang, tells the story of a food deliveryman during the epidemic.The official selection section Crouching Tigers, which presents international directorial debuts or second features, includes "The Whale Boy," winner of the GdA Director's Award at the 17th edition of Venice's Giornate degli Autori, and "Residue," winner of the Audience Award for Best Narrative Feature at the Slamdance Film Festival.Section Hidden Dragons, focusing on Chinese emerging talents, has "An Insignificant Affair," winner of the White Mulberry Award for Best First-time Director at the 22nd Far East Film Festival.Presenting films by renowned directors or films in a spotlight, the section Galas includes the opening film of the 77th Venice Film Festival "The TiesLacci," and "The Women Who Ran" and "Hidden Away," which won the Silver Bear for Best Director and the Silver Bear for Best Actor respectively at the 70th Berlin Film Festival.Other sections collect nine films made in Shanxi, and nine films of the Serbian New Wave produced from the 1960s to 1970s in Yugoslavia's era.Since many international film festivals canceled this year, a section used to present the award-winning films of the year was cut off. Instead, more films produced by new talents have been added into Crouching Tigers and Hidden Dragons sections."Under the current situation, we hope to maintain the core competitiveness of the Pingyao International Film Festival, and promotes its core value in helping young directors to develop," said Jia.One thing to notice is that the over 1,000 film-making projects are seeking for promotion this year, twice than the number of the previous year. "It reflects that because of coronavirus, fewer films were filmed outdoor, but more screenplays and programs were written at home," said Jia.The festival, therefore, decided to increase the number of projects to be promoted. "Like other film festivals, the Pingyao International Film Festival experienced the puzzles brought by the pandemic, but we found our own solution," he said.The Pingyao International Film Festival encourages dialogue between non-Western (Chinese, Asian, Eastern European, Latin American, and African) and Western film communities, and fosters communication and collaboration between Chinese and international filmmakers.The 4th Pingyao International Film Festival kicks off in the ancient city of Pingyao, north China's Shanxi Province on Saturday, providing a non-Western film industry's answer to the world in dealing with the coronavirus pandemic.This year marks the 125th anniversary of the birth of film.

She believes that the project will also contribute to "the important cultural and educational relationship between two countries."It is the largest ever digital festival of Chinese and UK creativity to have taken place through the British Council, according to Matt Burney, director of British Council China.The British international organization for education and culture partnered with the Department for International Trade of the UK and China's Chengdu Foreign Affairs Office to launch the online China-UK Contemporary Culture Festival, the first of its kind that is dedicated to cultural and creative exchanges between the countries.The festival celebrates the power of arts and culture in connecting people via introducing new artworks to wider audiences in China and the UK, aiming to help strengthen collaboration between artists and cultural institutions from the two countries as they are struggling to recover from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic.Mughal noted that through the digital project #ConnectedByCreativity, they sought to overcome the challenges artists, institutions and audiences face in connecting to one another at times of social distancing and travel restrictions. "We wanted to ensure we were able to support connection and build trust despite not being in the same room," she added."Adversity can sometimes breed creativity. We felt it was important to mark this moment in history and to share art that has been produced during a pandemic," she said, adding that the online festival would help expand the reach of the art to new audiences from both countries.According to the Council, the event opened earlier on the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, with the main focus on promoting the works from Chinese artists and institutions in the UK.

And Jiangsu Province tops the list.This year's National Day holiday is the first golden week since China entered the epidemic prevention and control period. Domestic civil aviation, railway, automobile, and other transportation are all fully restored.According to data released by China's biggest online travel agency Ctrip, the peak travel season in China started one day before the Golden Week holiday. On October 1, China's railways carried 15.09 million passengers and civil aviation 1.67 million, both record highs for a single day since the outbreak began.On Ctrip, all kinds of travel modes, including flights, trains, buses and rentals cars, have achieved overall growth. Among them, the number of air tickets increased by more than 100 percent month on month in September, the number of train tickets increased by more than 300 percent month on month, and the number of bus tickets increased by more than 200 percent month on month.Residents in Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen traveled the most, while Sanya, Shanghai, Beijing, Chengdu, Hangzhou, Xi'an,  Kunming, Nanjing ranked top as popular destinations.Among all Ctrip users during the holiday, the ratio of male to female was 52:48. But what is more noteworthy is that the post-90s, post-00s accounted for more than 60 percent of travelers.Twenty-five provinces in China revealed its tourism revenue over the eight-day National Day holiday, 15 of which exceeded 10 billion yuan according to officials.

From all-round scandals to plot-twists, this is an almost unscripted real-life TV show. And this year, drama is being served daily.Train-wreck debates, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and the following nomination debacle, President Trump getting, unsurprisingly, infected with COVID-19, and news of his $750 taxes are just examples of how these elections can be tragically juicy. Still, if you have time, disposition, and are curious about the world of American politics and some of the issues that are central in this year's cycle, we leave you some suggestions for the weekend.Interactive page: X Factors in the U.S. ElectionThe Circus: Inside the craziest political campaign on earthThis Showtime series with five seasons is a must. Starting in 2016 with the Primaries and following election, the show is running until today, giving an extraordinary account of the campaign and political world in the U.S. Featuring exclusive interviews and analyses by the show hosts, strategist Mark Mckinnon, and reporters John Heilemann and Mark Halperin, it gives an inside look to the candidates through candid interviews, backstage shots and them following the campaign trail.At the beginning of the show, the crew was following Republican candidate Jeb Bush, brother of former President George W. Bush, when he gets a call asking if he would support Donald Trump if he was the nominee to the White House. Bush's reaction was exactly the same as everyone else in the world, "that's not going to happen." Fate proved us all wrong. Since season 3, the show counts with Alex Wagner, an anchor and correspondent at CBS News, since Mark Halperin left. With episodes being released every week, it is a good way to keep track of what's going on.The Comey Rule   Another Showtime jewel, The Comey Rule was written and directed by Billy Ray, based on the former FBI Director James Comey's book "A Higher Loyalty."Starring Jeff Daniels, from the magnificent "Newsroom," as Comey and Brendan Gleeson as a scary Trump, the two-part event series starts with the investigation into Clinton's emails, their impact on the election, followed by the first months of the Trump presidency, when Comey is fired.Daniels portrays a naÃ¯ve honor-bound Comey. "[Comey] thinks that being right will save him. It won't," said an FBI agent.In the first episode, two Russian agents come on screen, commenting on testing a Twitter article with fake information against Secretary Clinton that reached 300,000 likes. The scene is frightening for feeling so real in today's social media environment.The second part begins with the dread of Trump's victory and possible outcomes.Gleeson's Trump is a solemn representation of the president. His speech and mannerisms are on point and additionally grim. When he says, "it's a terrible thing," an expression that is so Trump-like, it sounds daunting. Their exchanges on screen are always tense and on the verge of intimidation.Like the Washington Post said, watching this show is like "replaying a nightmare while we're still having it."Agent of ChaosAlex Gibney directs HBO's "Agent of Chaos," a two-part documentary focused on alleged Russia's efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election.In an interview with The Guardian, Gibney explained how the Russian government or business interests tried to sow chaos in the U.S. with disinformation campaigns led by "troll factories" that created divisive campaigns in social media, cyber-attacks, infiltration into state election systems; and supporting the Trump campaign.It's a documentary on how chaos can be weaponized "to amass power."In the episode focusing on Trump and Putin, Gibney noted, "It's all about greed, and avarice, and corruption. The agents of chaos in both countries had common interests."Read more: October surprise: Last-minute plot twists that decided U.S. presidentsKnock Down the House Directed by Rachel Lears, this 2019 Netflix documentary might not seem appropriate for now because is focused on the 2018 mid-terms. But the fact that it is centered around four women running for Congress, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Cori Bush, Joe Crowley, and Paula Jean Swearengin, makes it significant.This year, for the first time in the U.S. political history, six women ran for President, and one was nominated for Vice-President â Kamala Harris. Now, more than ever, women are partaking in civic life by running for office and donating. Ocasio-Cortez takes center stage as the cameras follow her "run to win" from the bar where she worked to the Capitol, where she remembers a trip with her father to the same place. "I think I finally did it [make him proud]."Immigration NationSeparation of families, the border wall, and other controversial immigration policies and statements also defined President Trump's tenure, and that is why it is on this list. Even if the topic has been gone from the presidential and VP debates and part of the public discussion.Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz were allowed to accompany U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents for over two years, but when the six-part documentary was about to come out, ICE threatened to block the release of some scenes.Only for this, the show must be watched. Secondly, it is easy to understand why the police would want to erase some footage: detention quotas, "collaterals" being detained because they are in the wrong place at the wrong time not because they committed a crime, and agents saying repeatedly they are "only doing their jobs." This sentence crystallizes their attempts to rationalize pain and suffering, perpetuating a system of terror. The Netflix docuseries includes heart-wrenching testimonials of fathers separated from their children, crying on camera wondering where they are, as the first episode carries the weight of their grief, desolation, anguish. And also the story, perhaps unknown to most, of U.S. army veterans that are deported, after all, it mirrors how being allowed to die for the country doesn't equal the right to live in it.(Cover photo: The Circus official poster.)If there is something that U.S. politics thrives in, it is drama.

Our admissions practices are completely fair and lawful. Yale's admissions policies will not change as a result of the filing of this baseless lawsuit. We look forward to defending these policies in court," Yale President Peter Salovey wrote in a statement to campus Thursday evening, the Wall Street Journal reported.In addition, Salovey countered that the DOJ's allegations are based on inaccurate statistics and unwarranted conclusions."DOJ's claim that the proportion of various racial groups admitted to Yale has remained stable for many years. In fact, in the last two decades, the percentage of admitted applicants fluctuated significantly for all groups," said Salovey.The Washington Post reported that a U.S. higher education association called the Justice Department's lawsuit "shocking and disheartening" and accused it of being politically motivated to bring it 26 days before the U.S. presidential election.The issue of race in college admissions in the U.S. has long been controversial, the report said.

But the public's wrath, fear, and grief are subsiding as this becomes just another case relegated to the annals of domestic violence.A farmer living on picking herbs in remote mountains in northwestern Sichuan Province, Lamu enjoyed sharing everyday life with her nearly 900,000 fans on the popular short video app Douyin. She regularly posted videos of working in the field, cooking for her family and dancing to Tibetan melodies. On camera, she was a happy-go-lucky woman fighting for a better life for her father and two children. But all of that abruptly ended when her former husband, surnamed Tang, broke into her home during one of her livestreaming sessions. Tang doused her in gasoline and then set her alight, burning 90 percent of her body, in addition to stabbing her multiple times. She died on September 30 after 16 days of medical treatment.Lamu's death sparked an outcry among netizens throughout the country as they demanded justice for her. Within a few days, hashtags mentioning her name received more than 420 million views. Nevertheless, the attention has been short-lived in this frenzied era of social media. People are outraged when such atrocities highlighting gender inequality continue to happen, but they soon forget, until the next "Lamu" appears.What went wrong? It seems that people unconsciously understand that such horrendous cases will inevitably happen again and again, and grow accustomed to these whopping numbers: More than 90 million married women in China regularly face domestic violence. Some 157,000 Chinese women commit suicide every year on average, making it one of the few countries where the female suicide rate is higher than it is for males, and among them 60 percent kill themselves because of domestic violence. On average the victims don't call the police until they've been abused at least 35 times."Violence will become the solution where law, morality and negotiation are all out of control," said Wang Fengli, a Beijing-based sociologist who studies domestic violence, during an interview with CGTN.China is a latecomer to having a legal interpretation of family violence. It wasn't until 2001 that physical abuse could be considered a reason to file for divorce. Only in 2016 did China's first anti-domestic violence law come into effect. It helps victims of physical or mental abuse in the family through various means such as restraining orders.But it "has loopholes," said Peng Chun, assistant professor of Peking University Law School. "It covers married couples, cohabitating partners, and other family members, but it does not deal with violence against former spouses or intimate partners who do not live together." As seen in Lamu's case, she was no longer eligible for a protection order because she was divorced, even though she'd been abused and threatened by Tang for a decade.Late last year, He Yuhong, a Chongqing-based beauty blogger who goes by the name Yuyamika, posted a video including surveillance footage that shows her ex-boyfriend violently dragging her from an elevator despite her struggling and yelling for help. "For the past six months, I seem to have been living in a nightmare," she wrote.The challenge in defining what constitutes domestic violence as well as the difficulty in gathering such evidence usually lead to delays in or rejections of issuing personal safety protection orders, according to Peng. In 2019, over 2,000 such orders were granted, triple that in 2016, but that was a far cry considering the hundreds of thousands of victims every year. Plus, the law fails to address sexual abuse or economic control.The gaps in the law and its enforcement aren't the only factors discouraging the abused from seeking justice. There is a deep-rooted mentality best encapsulated by an old Chinese saying, "Even upright officials cannot adjudicate family affairs." Due to this distinction, some police and judges would take family violence a private matter that should be dealt with by the family themselves."Thousands of years of patriarchy means that males are responsible for the fate of a household," said Wang. "In conservative or patriarchal societies, the rates of family violence are higher."This notion of tribal justice extends to cases such as Lamu's, where police only take the matter seriously when it ends in tragedy. Reports say that Lamu went to local police for help multiple times since last year in attempts to get a divorce. The authorities ended up giving Tang verbal warnings instead.Statistics from the All-China Women's Federation show that 80 percent of women calling the police for domestic violence are ignored because they are considered "family affairs" instead of criminal activity. Some of these women were even reprimanded by the police.The more difficult fight, however, lies in changing prejudices against those suffering from domestic violence. Even though Lamu was the victim, a few netizens on Weibo said that she must have done something wrong in her marriage to deserve being beaten, or that she shouldn't have attracted such attention by becoming an Internet celebrity/sensation. Those with this mentality essentially criticize the female victim for displaying too much agency or not living up to certain standards, while diminishing the male aggressor's responsibility.Wang thinks the psychology of victim-blaming is the biggest obstacle in the fight against domestic violence. Lamu is a "perfect victim" in many ways â an independent woman who struggled to divorce twice and supported her family on her own. She was fighting against her ex-husband, his violence and her fate, but she couldn't survive.Tang reportedly beat her not just at home, but overtly in the street. Lukewarm reactions from authorities in that small village ingrained with chauvinistic attitudes only hastened the onset of tragedy.But that can't explain it all. In relatively progressive societies, tragedies still happen. Hong Mei, a 40-year-old journalist who was in particular covering domestic violence in Ordos in Inner Mongolia, suffered violent beatings from her husband for over a decade before she died from abuse in 2016.It's not all gloom and doom. "The number of protection orders issued nationwide is on the rise, which shows that family violence victims are taking the initiative to protect themselves," Feng Yuan, co-founder of Equality, a Beijing-based NGO, told CGTN. In 2016, courts throughout China granted only 687 such orders; the figure rose to 2,004 in 2019.Meanwhile, the supreme court issued guidelines for local courts to reduce the burden of proof on plaintiffs, in consideration of the difficulty in acquiring the substantial evidence of abuse needed to apply for restraining orders.Lamu's tragic ending is part of a story that has been told again and again, as part of a cycle of complicity in which society chooses to ignore and forget simply because it's the easy thing to do. Attitudes toward domestic violence can only change when the public decides that one more incident of abuse is too many.Even now, users on social media lament that Lamu could have escaped death if she hadn't gone down from the mountains. But a world where Lamu could have lived her life without fear wherever she could have chosen to be is a world that we should strive for.(China 24, Zeng Ziyi and Yu Jing contributed reporting.)If you have a story on family violence and want to share it with us, please write to stories@cgtn.com.Also, if you or someone you know is suffering from domestic violence, please call this hotline (China only): 15117905157.It's been barely a week since Lamu, a 30-year-old woman from southwest China, died after being set on fire by her ex-husband.

local media reported Thursday. According to the Yomiuri Shimbun newspaper, the 11 countries and regions include Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Malaysia and China's Taiwan, among others.The Japanese government said it will urge travelers to not make unnecessary trips and to refrain from visits that are not urgent, the newspaper said.A day earlier, Japan and Australia discussed the promotion of further talks towards easing travel restrictions both countries have placed on each other due to the COVID-19.Japan's Foreign Ministry also confirmed recently that business travel would resume between Japan and South Korea as early as Thursday after flights were similarly suspended.Under the agreement between Tokyo and Seoul, both countries, on the resumption on bilateral travel, agreed that travelers on short-term business trips will not be required to self-isolate if they test negative for COVID-19 and submit travel itineraries to the appropriate authorities.Expatriates and long-term residents, meanwhile, will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the agreement.The deal, in essence, is similar to one struck recently between Japan and Singapore.Japan on October 1 eased entry restrictions into the country from foreigners around the world, although entry is still being refused for tourists.Those such as foreign medical professionals, teachers and others who are qualified for medium or long-term stays for three months or longer will be allowed entry, the government decided, with those traveling for business purposes for fewer than three months also being eligible.Eligible travelers will have to test negative for COVID-19 before entering Japan and upon arrival in Japan, while their sponsors, such as companies or organizations which support them, will be expected to ensure their self-isolation for 14 days, during which time they will not be allowed to use public transport.The government had said it would consider permitting 1,000 foreigners into the country per day, mainly to accommodate those who intend to stay for three months or longer, while looking to increasing the cap in the months ahead.Foreigners with resident status here who had been overseas have recently been allowed to re-enter the county, while expatriates and other long-term residents from some Asian countries have also been granted access into the country.These include those from Vietnam, Thailand and a number of other economies with which reciprocal agreements have been made.The Japanese government has more recently made similar reciprocal agreements with Singapore and Brunei.Currently, people from 159 countries and regions have been denied entry to the country, but Japan has steadily been easing its entry restrictions. (Cover: Japan.

for the younger generation, the Strawberry Music Festival (Strawberry), by the independent music label and organizer Modernsky, came back to Beijing on October 5 during the country's Golden Week holiday. It was delayed due to a COVID-19 pandemic that shattered the whole country earlier this year. As the first mega party in the city since, attendees and organizers have pulled out all the stops for the festival. Although the epidemic situation has been significantly improved in China, the festival still took place with strict anti-coronavirus measures: Masks were required throughout the show, body temperature scans were performed at the entrance, disinfection of the venue was carried out throughout the day, etc. As the biggest domestic music festival in China, Modernsky made sure they would not scrimp on talent. The three-day line up featured Chinese singers and bands that have become the focus of attention in recent years: New Pants, Jike Junyi, Vinida, and many others.Miumiu, the six-year-old girl who touched hearts of netizens worldwide with her angelic voice and amazing instrumental skills, was among the artists invited this year.

She said she now cherishes returning to normalcy and has a different outlook about going to music festivals. "Something that I used to take for granted has suddenly become so precious," Deng said.The pandemic also caused a lot of challenges in the hosting of the event.

The designers apply not only the 24 solar terms but also the 72 pentads of the Chinese phenology, which started from Han Dynasty some 2,000 years ago. "The 24 solar terms were inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2016. But the 72 pentads are not known to most people. To us, the 24 solar terms are too broad because the plants change every 5 to 7 days. With the 72 pentads we're able to fix the botanical materials to suit varied needs," said Zhao Sumin, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Gardenscape.Zhao's company grows around 1,500 different kinds of plants. Most of them are imported from the United States. In the past 18 years, she and her workmates have provided services to private and public spaces. However, her biggest wish is to revive the biodiversity in northern China. "I went to Minnesota, the United States in 1991 as a visiting scholar. I found that the private gardens and the whole city were rich in types and colors even in fall and winter. Four years later I started to introduce the greenhouse technology to China and then the work of industrial seedling raising. I realized what China needed the most was to import more colors of the nature, or let's say biodiversity. This is a long-term plan," Zhao said.Her company was designated as the national forestry germplasm source bank in 2006, the only one in Beijing and the only private enterprise of its kind in China. The State Forestry Administration experts were deeply impressed by the more than 110 kinds of Chinese flowering crabapple trees in the garden. "The crabapple trees were from China originally. They were found in a very wide range of areas from Hebei to Yunnan provinces. In the past two to three centuries, they were brought abroad and now there are over 600 kinds of them in the American archive. I chose the types which fruits don't fall in winter so the clients are able to enjoy the flowers in early spring, red and yellow leaves in fall and fruits when it snows. Also birds can eat the fruits in winter," Zhao said.Chinese people's longing for a better environment has been growing strongly in recent years. Gardening is widely applied in urban landscape, parks, expos. companies and houses. Zhao said her biggest wish is that people can go out and embrace nature. And more importantly, respect nature. "Gardening has become a part of Chinese people's lives. We have been working on combining the imported plants with local wild ones. We hope that people can know more about plants and respect them. Our gardens are opened to botanists, designers, families and schools from time to time. Nature has been nurturing humans and we should cherish its contribution and build a healthier ecosystem," she said.Through the sophisticated designs by botanists, Chinese urban dwellers are now able to escape their bustling day-to-day lives, and find some inner peace while at it. At the just concluded Beijing Design Expo, one of the major offline events of the Beijing Design Week, this tiny garden attracted much attention. The stall is just a very small part of the business of the Beijing-based botanical company and seed bank. In its 9 gardens in the outskirts of the city, visitors are able to experience vibrant colors any day of the year. The designers apply not only the 24 solar terms but also the 72 pentads of the Chinese phenology, which started from Han Dynasty some 2,000 years ago. "The 24 solar terms were inscribed on UNESCO's Intangible Cultural Heritage list in 2016. But the 72 pentads are not known to most people. To us, the 24 solar terms are too broad because the plants change every 5 to 7 days. With the 72 pentads we're able to fix the botanical materials to suit varied needs," said Zhao Sumin, CEO of Beijing Fat Dragon Brilliant Beauties Gardenscape.Zhao's company grows around 1,500 different kinds of plants. Most of them are imported from the United States. In the past 18 years, she and her workmates have provided services to private and public spaces. However, her biggest wish is to revive the biodiversity in northern China. "I went to Minnesota, the United States in 1991 as a visiting scholar. I found that the private gardens and the whole city were rich in types and colors even in fall and winter. Four years later I started to introduce the greenhouse technology to China and then the work of industrial seedling raising. I realized what China needed the most was to import more colors of the nature, or let's say biodiversity. This is a long-term plan," Zhao said.Her company was designated as the national forestry germplasm source bank in 2006, the only one in Beijing and the only private enterprise of its kind in China. The State Forestry Administration experts were deeply impressed by the more than 110 kinds of Chinese flowering crabapple trees in the garden. "The crabapple trees were from China originally. They were found in a very wide range of areas from Hebei to Yunnan provinces. In the past two to three centuries, they were brought abroad and now there are over 600 kinds of them in the American archive. I chose the types which fruits don't fall in winter so the clients are able to enjoy the flowers in early spring, red and yellow leaves in fall and fruits when it snows. Also birds can eat the fruits in winter," Zhao said.Chinese people's longing for a better environment has been growing strongly in recent years.

In 2019, 98.4 percent of the primary and secondary schools had internet access, and 90.1 percent had multimedia classrooms."The educational pattern has changed since the pandemic occurred, but the basic framework of basic education will not change just due to such an emergency," said Yu Minhong, founder of Chinese educational institute "New Oriental," adding that teachers had started using online education as a tool to better help students before COVID-19 with both formats merging together in the future."Online education will not replace offline education," he added.Online education appeared in the 1990s when homes in China began connecting to the internet. But, its scope and reach remained limited, and it only supplemented education in classrooms. With technological advances and greater penetration of internet in China, the use of online education picked up after 2010.Yu also noted that thanks to 5G technology, online education will become more accessible to students in rural or mountainous areas, giving them a chance to increase their knowledge and sign up for new courses.As of May 11, a national online learning platform for primary and secondary school students has received over 2 billion views.(With input from agencies)The convergence of online and offline education will take over China's educational development in a post COVID-19 world, according to a fresh report on China's internet development.A total of 282 million Chinese students have turned to online courses in the first half of this year, according to the report issued by the China Internet Network Information Center.Data from the report shows that during the COVID-19 outbreak, the number of daily active users on online education platforms increased from 87 million to 127 million after the Spring Festival, up by 46 percent.This year's popularization of online education builds on an already existing tech infrastructure at schools, the report said.

In the village, over 80 percent of households make papers at home using the original method that dates back over 1,800 years. Historically, Chinese people have been using various plants, such as hemp and bamboo, for making paper. The villagers use barks of paper mulberry as raw material. The trees, commonly seen on the roadsides, can grow fast and have been used to make paper from the early second century. Ai Kannan, who used to be a monk at a Buddhist temple, showed us the process of making paper.

Sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy in 2017 and forced it to postpone the 2018 prize â a first in 70 years.Two laureates were named last year with the 2018 award going to Poland's Olga Tokarczuk and Austrian novelist Peter Handke honored as the 2019 Nobel laureate. Handke's prize unleashed a flood of criticism as the writer is known for supporting Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic in the Balkan wars.Gluck would have received the accolade from King Carl XVI Gustaf at a formal ceremony in Stockholm on December 10, the anniversary of the 1896 death of scientist Alfred Nobel who created the prizes in his last will and testament.The in-person ceremony, however, has been canceled this year due to the coronavirus pandemic.

It's the first exhibition to open in the British capital since the COVID-19 pandemic brought a lockdown to the UK's public spaces, including art galleries and museums.Getting Nauman's installations in place has taken seven weeks â an unusually long time to set up an exhibition, due to new measures to limit the number of people in the space at any one time. But for curator and former director of Tate Nicholas Serota, the wait was worth it."We've had to take every possible precaution. And, of course, the visitors, when they arrive, will be given every possible safeguard. But it's the most exciting moment to have a new show by a great artist in one of the great museums of the world," Serota said.Nauman's work spans more than 50 years and some themes reoccur over time, such as the human body, lettering and language, and physical and psychological pressure. In a career that defies easy categorization, he has experimented with neons, video installations, sculpture and more.In addition, some works have taken on new meaning in this era of COVID-19. The piece "Hands Washing Normal," for instance, shows someone washing hands vigorously with a lot of soap."This is a piece that was not made this year. It was made in 1996. So Nauman takes these rituals that we all perform and makes us look at them even more carefully. And whatever resonance that piece had in 1996, it certainly has a very different resonance in 2020," said Serota.Nauman may not be as famous as Andy Warhol or Yayoi Kusama, but his impact on the art scene is undeniable. His exploration of the dull, everyday life is what makes this exhibition special, according to art critic for Londonist Tabish Khan."When you first go in, it's slightly strange because you think art is meant to be beautiful or is meant to be inspiring. But here we are celebrating the mundane, the inane, sometimes the slightly awkward, confusing or even disturbing," Khan said."We like to celebrate the moments that are great, but at the same time, it's also filled by moments where nothing actually happens," he added.The exhibition runs until February 21, 2021.(With input from AP)Tate Modern, a modern art gallery in London, launched a new exhibition on Wednesday, displaying a variety of works by American conceptual artist Bruce Nauman.

Previously, the film was shortlisted at the Cannes Film Festival in 2020 as one of only two finalists among Chinese-language films.The film centers on China's post-90s generation by telling the story of a restless young man named Kun. As he's about to graduate from college, he drops out of the film school and embarks on a journey "marked by restlessness and absurdity, calamity and joy" as introduced on BFI's official website.Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen's "Mangrove" was selected as the opening film to raise the curtain of the festival. It tells the trial of the Mangrove Nine â a group of black activists accused of inciting a riot at a protest â in the 1970s.

She was told by her teacher of a special opportunity to work with helicopters. The project was recruiting students from poor families in Tibet, and she was lucky to be selected as one of them."At the beginning, I was excited and I couldn't believe it," she said.From February 2017, she started her training and learned to operate and maintain helicopters in Jiangsu. Then in March 2018, she graduated, becoming one of the 28 Tibetans who succeeded in being among the first Tibetan pilots to obtain a license.Back in Lhasa, she is now a civil helicopter pilot with the Lhasa Snow Eagle General Aviation. She'll carry tourists and show them around the city of Lhasa, introducing some of its attractions, customs and history. She said it's quite different to see the landmark Potala Palace up in the air than seeing it from the ground."I feel a sense of accomplishment when I take tourists to see Lhasa from the air," she told CGTN.With a pair of aviator sunglasses and a pilot uniform, Janre Yeshi is ready to board the helicopter and show tourists what the city of Lhasa looks like from above.Born and raised in an impoverished family in Lhasa's Dangxiong County, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, the 23-year-old Tibetan girl never imagined that her life could encounter such tremendous transformation.Back in 2016, a poverty alleviation project launched together by the local government and the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu utterly changed her life path.It was around the time of the national college entrance examination when students from across the country were busy preparing for the exam.

The project was recruiting students from poor families in Tibet, and she was lucky to be selected as one of them."At the beginning, I was excited and I couldn't believe it," she said.From February 2017, she started her training and learned to operate and maintain helicopters in Jiangsu. Then in March 2018, she graduated, becoming one of the 28 Tibetans who succeeded in being among the first Tibetan pilots to obtain a license.Back in Lhasa, she is now a civil helicopter pilot with the Lhasa Snow Eagle General Aviation. She'll carry tourists and show them around the city of Lhasa, introducing some of its attractions, customs and history. She said it's quite different to see the landmark Potala Palace up in the air than seeing it from the ground."I feel a sense of accomplishment when I take tourists to see Lhasa from the air," she told CGTN.The Guardian Art Center in Beijing is holding an exhibition to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Art Nova 100, which nominates about 100 artists from across China each year. A total of 500 works from those young artists are on display, covering a wide range of art forms, including oil painting, traditional Chinese painting, sculpture, installation, video and multimedia. With the theme "IN/OUT," the exhibition is divided into three sections: "fluid society," "natural simulation," and "the deduction of civilization." Through their artworks, young artists express their understanding of nature and their reflection on technology and society. In a multimedia work named "Gaze into Haze," people are able to see multi-layered information like the silhouette of visitors, English words, LEGO and fish in the background, yet none of them can be seen clearly. The artist wants to mirror the information explosion that we are currently experiencing. Another work shows a phone number and there is actually a cell phone hidden inside the installation. When people call the number, it makes disturbing noises."It's difficult for us to stay quiet nowadays. Even if you want peace and quiet, you are easily affected by others. So this work reflects our situation in a plain way," says the creator AIWU.Launched in 2011, Art Nova 100 is an art platform that discovers and promotes young artists. Each year, thousands of young artists in China apply for the program, and around 100 are selected after evaluation from experts.Those artists on the final shortlist are invited to participate in Art Nova 100, which includes exhibitions and forums both in China and abroad, as well as a multi-channel artist promotion program. "Over 100 young artists started their career from this platform. Before we started, many art students would either give up on becoming artists after graduation or stay unknown to the public in small studios," Peng Wei, director of Art Nova 100, said."But I feel proud that in the past nine years since the platform was launched, it has helped many young artists follow their dreams," she added.The Guardian Art Center in Beijing is holding an exhibition to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Art Nova 100, which nominates about 100 artists from across China each year.

It took only 3 years to build, and first went into operation 6 years ago.Chen Xin felt curious and excited when he first boarded a bullet train 6 years ago. He still remembers the day he got into a bullet train cab for the first time. He wasn't allowed to touch the control desk because his teacher was afraid that he might do something wrong and force the train to stop. Now he's become one of the best bullet train drivers in Xinjiang.Before 2011, Chen drove either diesel or electric locomotives. But he says driving bullet trains is very different, and much better."Diesel and electric locomotives don't seal properly. Sand still gets inside, even when the windows are closed," Chen said. He had to clean up the sand or it could have damaged the control desk and other devices in the cabin."Now bullet trains are wind and sand proof. So I can focus on my work, safely taking passengers to their destinations," he added.Xinjiang's first high-speed rail line officially opened in November 2014, connecting the region's capital city Urumqi with Hami, a city in east Xinjiang. The 530-kilometer trip used to take 4-6 hours. Today, it takes only 2.5 hours. Traveling by bullet train has now become a new way of life for the locals.Despite the transformation that high-speed railway has brought to the city, for Chen, one thing hasn't changed. That is the sense of responsibility."No matter what kind of locomotives you're driving, you should stick to your sense of responsibility. You should be responsible for yourself, your passengers, as well as the state property," he told CGTN.Chen has witnessed the railway's development in Xinjiang, from diesel locomotives to electric, and now bullet trains. What impressed him the most are the greater levels of efficiency as well as the working environment.The speed limit for trains in Xinjiang is now two times higher than before and Chen believes it'll be three times faster in the foreseeable future.The bullet train is changing people's way of life in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and boosting the region's economic potential.

China's first desert sculpture museum can offer you such an experience.Scattered in a vast desert in northwest China, 102 pieces of sculptures, created by artisans from home and abroad, have been drawing large crowds to the Suwu Desert Scenic Area, making it a new travel hot spot during the National Day holiday.Themed "Jewels of the Silk Road," the 2020 Minqin (China) International Desert Sculpture Symposium began last month in the scenic area in Minqin County, Wuwei City, northwest China's Gansu Province.According to the organizers, the creative artworks on display were selected from 2,669 entries by 936 artists from 73 countries and regions on the basis of not only the creations but the special environment of the exhibition."It is the first time that I have been to this desert sculpture museum. The desert is magnificent and spectacular. I have seen every sculpture here and each sculpture contains rich connotations, which are quite inspiring. It is amazing to be here," said a tourist Zhang Jiarui.Another tourist Wang Yanwen, who is from Gansu's capital city of Lanzhou, said, "We saw these artistic sculptures in various shapes. We also took a lot of photos. When we go back, I will post them on social media platforms so that more people can see them and come to this place for sightseeing."In addition to the sculpture exhibition, this year's event, in its third edition, also features a variety of activities, such as artist exchange seminars, sculpture photography exhibitions and desert camping.Situated on the ancient Silk Road, Minqin is a hinterland oasis between the Tengger and Badain Jaran deserts. Thanks to the annual event, it has become a popular destination for tourists to see sculptures permanently located in the dramatic setting of the Suwu desert.Home to the largest desert reservoir in Asia, the 16,000-square-kilometer county, more than 10 times the size of London City, plays a crucial role in local ecological restoration. It shows generations of efforts of carrying forward the tradition of desert prevention and control.The county first held several international desert sculpture creation camps and invited domestic and foreign artists to unleash their talents and creativity, and then built China's first desert sculpture museum to showcase the creations.Covering an area of about 700,000 square meters, the immense desert museum has a total investment outlay of about 120 million yuan (nearly $17.7 million). It aims to boost the integrated and sustainable development of the local cultural tourism industry.The natural museum also serves as a platform to promote the concepts about green life and environmental protection, as well as the harmonious coexistence of human and nature.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Wenyi)Imagine you're driving through a desert when suddenly larger-than-life sculptures start popping up out of nowhere.

This year's Beijing Design Week launched a special section to promote the application of cultural IP. CGTN went to a newly established platform to see how they are trying to revive classical IP and help young designers.At a cafe by the Forbidden City, visitors can enjoy a moment within a space decorated with the well-known "One Thousand Li of Rivers and Mountains" by Wang Ximeng, and have a taste of royal flavor from the Palace Museum, such as "Kangxi Likes Chocolates." And as a model combining modern design and the traditional culture, Si Shi Ying Wu presents the cooperation between inheritors of intangible cultural heritage and designers.All the paintings on the wall were downloaded from a platform called Creative Commons Zero (CC0) Design."Under the CC0 license, a list of famous museums, including the British Museum, has opened their digital materials to the public for free. This is a great leap in the history of human civilization," Zhao Dongbao, co-founder of CC0 Design, told CGTN."It's a pity that only a few Chinese cultural institutions are cooperating with these international organizations. We are doing this to get more people to know about this and make full use of it," he added.The platform has stored a large amount of content and is continuing to expand its capacity. Users can search and download for free, and the platform also encourages young designers to create their own works based on these materials. It is the first of its kind to develop products based on CC0 license."The CC0 license has mobilized more designers to create their own works based on high-definition digital material," Yu Fei, co-founder of CC0 Design, also Assistant President of Sinofaith Group said. "Since then, a lot of amazing artworks have been produced, which are dynamic and popular and somehow extend the life cycle of museum collections. For some time, we've been discussing how to breathe new life into cultural relics. They shouldn't be kept asleep in museums. We need to let more people learn about them and enjoy them. We hope our designers can find these materials easily, and those precious masterpieces will give them great inspiration," Yu said.It's a hope which resonates with young designers. Chen Hui, a product designer said, "It's difficult for us designers to find materials. We have to search a bunch of websites. This website collects all these materials. It is a user-friendly platform and all of these are free."So far, over 10 museums in the world have adopted the CC0 license.

He was 65.A person close to Van Halenâs family confirmed the rocker died Tuesday due to cancer. The person was not authorized to publicly release details in advance of an official announcement."I can't believe I'm having to write this, but my father, Edward Lodewijk Van Halen, has lost his long and arduous battle with cancer this morning," Wolf Van Halen wrote in a message on Twitter with a picture of the rocker who was 65."He was the best father I could ever ask for," he added. "Every moment I've shared with him on and off stage was a gift."My heart is broken and I don't think I'll ever fully recover from this loss. I love you so much, Pop." Born in the Netherlands and raised in California, Van Halen founded the rock group with his older brother Alex in the early 1970s and quickly earned a fan base.He was famous for what became known as "finger tapping" â playing the guitar with two hands, like a piano.He was also known for his guitars, including one named Frankenstein which he pieced together from part of other instruments.Among the group's classics are "Jump," "Panama," "Runnin' with the Devil," and the guitar solo "Eruption.""Ed's a once- or twice-in-a-century kind of guy. There's Hendrix and there's Eddie Van Halen," friend and guitarist Jerry Cantrell of Alice in Chains said during Grammy weekend in January 2019. "Those two guys tilted the world on its axis."Van Halen has sold more than 75 million albums and has more number one hits on the mainstream U.S. rock chart than any other artist, according to the band's label. The group's album "1984" was to be the band's high point, giving them their only number one single "Jump."The creative tension within the band boiled over during the "1984" tour, with Eddie Van Halen and original frontman David Lee Roth falling out. Roth left the band in April 1985.One of his gripes with Eddie Van Halen was reportedly the rocker's outside work that included providing the lead-in guitar for Michael Jackson's 1983 smash hit "Beat It." However, Van Halen announced a reunion tour in 2007 with Roth performing with the group for the first time in 22 years.Another tour planned in 2012 had to be cancelled after Eddie Van Halen had to undergo emergency surgery.But the band reunited again in 2015 for an extensive North American tour.Eddie Van Halen was known to have health problems that would interfere with his work for years.He underwent hip surgery in 1999 and had part of his tongue removed in 2000 after being diagnosed with cancer, likely because of heavy smoking.Although he was declared cancer free following the surgery, the American tabloid news site TMZ reported earlier this year that he had been going to Germany for throat cancer treatment. His drug abuse and heavy drinking contributed to his 2007 divorce from TV actress Valerie Bertinelli after 16 years of marriage."I was an alcoholic, and I needed alcohol to function," he said in a 2015 interview with Billboard magazine. "I didn't drink to party. Alcohol and cocaine were private things to me. I would use them for work. The blow keeps you awake and the alcohol lowers your inhibitions. I'm sure there were musical things I would not have attempted were I not in that mental state."Tributes from some of the biggest names in the music world poured in Tuesday following news of his death."I'm just devastated to hear the news of the passing of my dear friend Eddie Van Halen. He fought a long and hard battle with his cancer right to the very end. Eddie was one of a very special kind of person, a really great friend. Rest In Peace my dear friend till we meet again," Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi tweeted."Sad to hear Eddie Van Halen has passed away. A guitar innovator with a fierce spirit of musical and technical exploration. Prayers and thoughts with his family and friends," Yusuf/Cat Stevens tweeted.Songwriter Diane Warren said in a tweet that "guitars are gently weeping everywhere.

Alcohol and cocaine were private things to me. I would use them for work. The blow keeps you awake and the alcohol lowers your inhibitions. I'm sure there were musical things I would not have attempted were I not in that mental state."Tributes from some of the biggest names in the music world poured in Tuesday following news of his death."I'm just devastated to hear the news of the passing of my dear friend Eddie Van Halen. He fought a long and hard battle with his cancer right to the very end. Eddie was one of a very special kind of person, a really great friend. Rest In Peace my dear friend till we meet again," Black Sabbath's Tony Iommi tweeted."Sad to hear Eddie Van Halen has passed away. A guitar innovator with a fierce spirit of musical and technical exploration. Prayers and thoughts with his family and friends," Yusuf/Cat Stevens tweeted.Songwriter Diane Warren said in a tweet that "guitars are gently weeping everywhere. Shred In Power Eddie Van Halen."The rocker is survived by his second wife Janie Liszewski and his son, as well as his first wife Bertinelli.Theyâre one of the hottest boy bands in the world, South Koreaâs BTS.And everyone wants a part of them, or as close to it as they can get.Retail investors in South Korea snapped up shares of Big Hit Entertainment, the music label behind BTS, to the tune of $50 billion during the two-day subscription as part of its initial public offering.That was more than 600 times the value of shares on offer to retail investors, meaning that many would-be shareholders will receive only a fraction of their requests.Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter.

And, it symbolizes China's highest authority.  As one of many structures built to mark the 10th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, its design and construction draw wide attention.  In 1954, the first National People's Congress was held, but only  about 1,200 deputies attended the conference due to the small meeting venue. Building a larger meeting place seemed an urgent task. Soon after, CPC Chairman Mao Zedong came up with the idea of building an auditorium for 10,000 people. "The Great Hall of the People was a great breakthrough at that time in terms of scale," said Mi Junren, vice chief architect of the Institute of Architecture and Environmental Art Design. "It was not an easy job to build a structure with a floor area of 170,000 square meters. Another important highlight is the halls inside, such as the grand auditorium, which can hold 10,000 people. There isn't another auditorium as big in the world today. The Great Hall of the People embodies the highest technical level of architecture, acoustics, lighting, and sound." In 1958 and 1959, designers and construction workers from across the nation came to Beijing to work on the project. They were faced with many challenges, including the interior ceiling design of the Grand Auditorium. At last, the proposal given by then premier, Zhou Enlai was adopted. He raised the concept of "Water and sky merge in one color.""The most wonderful design of the auditorium is the ceiling," said Mi. "We can see elements like the pentacle stars, sunflowers, and water ripples. The roof of the building is more than 30 meters above the ground, and if the walls and roof form a right angle, then the roof will appear very small. Premier Zhou Enlai suggested that the roof and walls be integrated to form a cambered surface. With lights turned on, people feel like they're sitting under a vast starry sky."  The columns at the east gate of the building were also a challenge. After construction was completed, then Beijing Mayor Peng Zhen decided that the span between the middle two columns should be larger than the rest, according to Chinese architectural tradition. He insisted on the removal of the 23-meter-high concrete pillars. "The central concrete structure was irremovable, so workers tried to remove the decorative surface to the side. After removing the outer surface, the distance between the middle columns became larger than the rest," Mi said.Construction of The Great Hall of the People was completed in September 1959, right before the tenth anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.  Although six decades have passed, the building continues to look powerful and solemn on the west side of Tian'anmen Square.  (Cover image: The Great Hall of the People. /VCG)The Great Hall of the People, where major national affairs are discussed and decided, is an architectural treasure on Beijing's Tian'anmen Square.

It's 200 kilometers from the Taklamakan Desert. On this day, CGTN met the archaeological team of the site, the oldest ever excavated in Xinjiang.The rammed construction with barbican entrances is called the Ruins of Luntai City, as well as Kuiyuq Shehayer ancient city, which means "city in ashes." It is there CGTN met Dang Zhihao from the Xinjiang Institute of Cultural Relics and Archaeology and the project manager of the city ruins. He's been doing archeological work for decades; this is his second project.The archeologists started working there three-and-a-half years ago. They have since uncovered substantial evidence that this ancient site could be traced as far back as 2,500 years, to as early as 500 BC during the Spring and Autumn period (771-476 BC)."That is to say, at least starting between the Han Dynasty and the Spring and Autumn era, on the northern rim of Tarim Basin, here stands such a city. It shocked us," said Dang.The site's geographic proximity to the Taklamakan Desert has proven to be an enormous challenge for the archeological team in unfolding this mysterious site as the sand blows relentlessly, covering almost everything in dry dust."Compared with central China, the environment in Xinjiang for archaeological investigation is harsh, which makes our work more difficult. But the charm of our work is constantly updating knowledge about the world with new findings. This allows more people to learn about Xinjiang's history, and love the land more," Dang said.Some wall base relics, embroideries, metal works of the ancient city were discovered. But what was this area used for remains obscured.It usually takes two to three decades to finish unearthing a site. But one's life doesn't too have many decades. For archaeologist like Dang, the the process of unearthing a city like this is like raising a baby. Although, he and his colleagues have put much effort into this project, they are still many questions to figure out."We hope to know the city from its birth to death. We hope to understand it comprehensively through our long-time study. As we always say, although we each don't have many decades, we hope to age together in one city," said Dang. "It's worthwhile spending my entire career figuring out one city thoroughly."Filmed by Wang YuchengOn day 25 of our Amazing Xinjiang trip, we arrived in Luntai County in Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture in the middle of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

CGTN talked with veteran toy designer Stryker Wang who shared his inspirations and his opinion on China's toy market.During the interview, Wang showcased a little dinosaur DIO â the first member of the BeastBox series. It's a toy that can easily turn from a square into a dinosaur. The designer introduced the inspiration of the toy: "No matter what the shape of the toy is, it will always be wrapped up in a square box. So we thought why can't we make the toy a box, and the box is the toy itself. This is how DIO the dinosaur was born.""After its release, the toy received great feedback. Many say they are glad to see that China finally has its own transformative toy. And so we continued our BeastBox series," he added.The series has attracted many followers from both home and abroad. Wang used to work in the video game industry. But he always had a passion for toys. In 2000, he started a magazine about toys. Even though the publication didn't last long, Wang found a direction for his career. He said: "I've always been a kid that likes to play. I'm very curious and always wanted to dig into areas that are not familiar to the public."During the interview, he showed reporter his first toy collection â a little Transformer."My parent gave it to me when I was in middle school as an award for good grades. Even though it is very small, it brings back precious memories. It is fair to say that it is the beginning of my toy career," Wang said. The pop-culture trend of art toys has been developing and maturing in recent years. They first appeared in the 1990s, and their popularity has grown. Today, that demand is strong and the market is booming. Wang said that toys have always been a representation of culture through human development. For young people, toys are also art."Art is not only vases or oil paintings, toys are also a contemporary expression of art. I think the toy culture is very diverse. I hope more people can pay attention to them and realize that they are part of people's lives that are worth collecting and studying," he said. Wang believes that there are plenty of talented toy designers in China, but what's lacking are original styles and a healthy market. "I believe China's toy industry surpasses those of Japan and the U.S. at the base level. By that I mean industrial technology and human input. But on an ideological level we are still far behind. There's a lot to learn, like the ways of thinking and the experience from decades of practice," he said."However I think the gap is narrowing. With the rapid development of China's economy and its toy business, we are now having a lot of cooperation with designers globally," the designer added. "Be an interesting person, do fun things" â Wang says this is a motto for him and his company. He believes as long as people in the industry have true passion and love for this business, China's toy market is sure to grow stronger.Art toys, also known as designer toys, are meant for adults with a collection value produced with creative ideas.

In its holds we discovered military vehicles, porcelain and many crates with contents still unknown."The Karlsruhe had been taking part in Operation Hannibal, one of the largest sea evacuations in history, which helped more than one million German troops and civilians from East Prussia escape the Soviet advance towards the end of World War II.  Documentation from the time suggests the boat left Koenigsberg in a hurry, with a large cargo and 1,083 people onboard."All this, put together, stimulates the human imagination. Finding the German steamer and the crates with contents as yet unknown resting on the bottom of the Baltic Sea may be significant for the whole story," said diver Tomasz Zwara.The Amber Room was constructed in Prussia and then given to Tsar Peter the Great of Russia in 1716 as a present.The Germans dismantled it and took it to Koenigsberg during the war, from where it disappeared during Allied bombing raids on the city. Many believe it was destroyed.

They were already down about 80 percent this year, due to the impact of the pandemic on the entertainment industry.  The company reopened its UK cinemas in July but customers numbers have been small since then.Cineworld's CEO, Moody Greidinger, said it was "not a decision we made lightly.""We did everything in our power to support safe and sustainable reopenings," he added. "We will continue to monitor the situation closely and will communicate any future plans to resume operations in these markets at the appropriate time."Greidinger's statement also highlighted the challenges the firm faced in getting studios to release new movies.  Cineworld was hoping the latest James Bond film, No Time to Die, could help turn around its fortunes. But its release was recently delayed until April 2021 â the second time it has been pushed back this year.Despite the closures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to go back to movie theaters."Cinemas do now have ways of letting their shows go on in a COVID-secure way and I'd encourage people to go out to the cinema, enjoy themselves and support those businesses," said Johnson.As part of the closures, 536 theaters will be shut in the U.S. and 127 in the UK.  Experts say more job losses could follow in the industry if demand remains subdued, with COVID-19 restrictions and lockdowns in place."Cineworld's closure will have a devastating, significant impact in the short term to the cinema market but it's probably a sensible decision for the operator," said Rob Arthur, director of cinema consultancy firm The Big Picture."If you've got no revenue and you can't pay for your staff and government subsidy schemes like furlough end, it's impossible to stay open because you're essentially trading insolvently," he added. The world's second largest cinema chain, Cineworld, is temporarily shutting its theaters in the U.S. and the UK.The move is due to low footfall as a result of COVID-19 and puts 45,000 jobs at risk, including 5,500 in the UK.Cineworld's shares in London plunged more than 50 percent at one stage on Monday.

One of the essential pieces of Latin America's culture is shaped by the native inhabitants. We spoke to one man in Colombia who has dedicated his life to the conservation of indigenous rights.  Check out The China Report, our new weekly newsletter. Subscribe here!Twenty-eight-year-old Ye Luying is undoubtedly one of the most impressive painters among the rising Chinese painters in recent years. Her cartoon-style "Nymph of the Luo River" or "Luoshenfu" won many prizes, including the best illustration award at the 13th Golden Dragon Award for Chinese Animation held in 2016. The painting is based on the author Cao Zhi from the Wei Dynasty (220-265) and his admiration for a water goddess. In his narratives, Cao used flowery language to describe her and their sincere love.Many say that Ye perfectly combines both Western culture and eastern culture in her adaption of ancient paintings. But Ye herself doesn't really agree."I think my paintings are deeply rooted in my hometown and our Chinese culture. I'm a native Chinese. My paintings just look slightly Western in format," Ye told CGTN.Ye studied at the Chinese Academy of Art and the Oslo National Academy of the Arts in Norway. She has also traveled to over 20 countries. She said those experiences might contribute to her  mixed painting style."Many people like me had the experience of studying abroad. We've not only seen Gu Kaizhi but also Michelangelo. This so-called Eastern-Western mixed style is something that comes out naturally from my mind,â she said.Over the past decade, Ye has completed several painting books based on ancient Chinese stories and calligraphy works, including the "Preface of the Orchid Pavilion" ("Lanting Xu') and "Mulan."Reflecting on her years of practice, Ye joked that painting itself is labor-intensive work, like climbing a mountain."I feel the happiest when I'm drawing drafts because I can draw whatever I want. Another moment I feel the happiest is when I finally finish a certain piece. That will give me a sense of fulfillment,â Ye told CGTN.During the interview, Ye also revealed her plan to make a piece related to cats as she is a cat-person. She also said she longs for some breakthrough in future works."I'm more unrestrained and vigorous than what I've presented in my drawings. I hope I can make more imaginative work in the future. I think I'll get the chance to do it. That's very likely," Ye said.Reporter: Deng JunfangVideographer: Shen Langlang, Deng JunfangVideo editor: Zhang ChunnanProject manager: Deng JunfangProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiTwenty-eight-year-old Ye Luying is undoubtedly one of the most impressive painters among the rising Chinese painters in recent years. Her cartoon-style "Nymph of the Luo River" or "Luoshenfu" won many prizes, including the best illustration award at the 13th Golden Dragon Award for Chinese Animation held in 2016. The painting is based on the author Cao Zhi from the Wei Dynasty (220-265) and his admiration for a water goddess.

Teng Kuixing, jury member and also a famous voice director, shared his thoughts with CGTN.With more than two decades of dubbing experience, Teng has given voice to many popular cartoons including "Dragon Balls" and "Crayon Shin Chain." In 2015, Teng was the voice director for the Chinese animation film "Monkey King: Hero Is Back," which was described as the future of domestic animation.Speaking of the work, Teng vividly recalls the process of creation."The creative process was very, very difficult at the beginning. Every line was recorded dozens of times. As you can imagine, we got very tired and numb. We take a break and then go on to the next one, and then come back and listen," he said. "Language is like a musical instrument. It must be in the correct position, no more or less, to arouse the audience's emotions. So, we go back and forth," he added.There were five competition areas in total, with a network competition area on the new media platform. Dubbing fans only needed to upload their works on the network platform to participate in the competition.Following the start of registration on June 16, more than 3,000 entries were received from six regions. The quality of the entries has been greatly improved compared with previous years, among which non-professional competitors account for a large proportion.Having won the Best Mentor Award, Teng thinks the competition has been getting more and more professional. "In both team and individual competitions, the ability displayed is higher than that of previous ones. Of course, we do it every year, and it's going to get better and better, and that's also what we're looking forward to," he said.The participation of more and more professional competitors reflects the growing strength of the industry. As an expert, Teng said there is still a long way to go for the competitors. "More and more people are taking this as a career in this industry currently. Therefore, the elimination rate is higher and requirements keep on getting higher. Only by being better can you stay and have a chance to stand out," he said.Reporter: Yang MengVideographer: Shen LanglangVideo editor: Zhang ChunnanCover image designer: Chen YuyangProject manager: Deng JunfangProducer: Si NanSupervisor: Zhang ShileiWinners of the Character Voice Competition were unveiled at the 16th China International Cartoon and Animation Festival (CICAF).

The centrifugal force produced by the rotation of the earth and by the trumpet shape of Hangzhou Bay in Zhejiang makes it easy for the tide to come in, but difficult for it to ebb. Qiantang River is known for the world's largest tidal bore, which is locally called the Silver Dragon.  The best time of year to see the Qiantang tidal bore is midway through the eighth month on the Chinese lunar calendar, often during the Mid-Autumn Festival. Zhejiang has made continuous efforts to strengthen the riverbank as defenses to the possibly destructive tides since ancient times.  A centuries-old seawall in Haining, with its solid structure and enduring bases, is known as one of the three major projects in ancient China along with the Great Wall and the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal. A spectacular tidal bore on the Qiantang River in east China's Zhejiang Province attracted a large number of tourists from across the country on Saturday, the third day of the eight-day break for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival.  The bore traveled 55 kilometers from the East China Sea to reach Daquekou, one of the best viewing points for tidal bores on the river.  At noon, the tide reached Yanguan Town where it evolved into a one-line tidal bore, inspiring tourists to snap pictures with their smartphones.  The tidal bore is caused by the gravitational pull of the stars and planets.

Other artifacts and at least 28 statues were found in the two deep wells, the ministry said.A sealed door was also unearthed where it is expected more mummies may lie behind, said Khaled el-Anany the first Minister of Antiquities and Tourism, adding that the artifacts were in an excellent state of preservation and would be displayed in the Grand Egyptian museum next year.Mostafa Waziri, the general director of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, told NBC News that the discovery reminded him of the tomb of King Tutankhamun, because both had been discovered almost intact.The Saqqara plateau is part of the necropolis of Egypt's ancient city of Memphis.

In it, the 87-year-old Zhou Quandi, who lost both his hands, writes âæç¾æ´æ, ä¿å®¶å«å½â (meaning "Resist the U.S. aggression and aid Korea, to defend my homeland") to commemorate the 70th anniversary of when the Chinese People's Volunteer Army (PVA) joined the War to Resist U.S. Aggression. In June 1950, the Korean War broke out after the Korean Peninsula was split into north and south. The United States sent troops and dispatched ships and aircraft to meddle in the Sino-Korean border. Facing American threats, the newly founded People's Republic of China decided in October to participate in the war to defend its national security and help its neighbor, calling it the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea.Hundreds of thousands of young people in China joined the war to defend their homeland, including then 17-year-old Zhou.According to Zhou's memories, Korea suffered unprecedented cold weather that year. PVA soldiers braved temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius, eating potatoes and drinking snow water to quench their thirst while carrying out combat missions in the Hwangchoryong area in Korea."We lay on the snow for three days. On the last night, when we finally started to fight the enemy, I couldn't get up anymore. My feet and hands were numb," said Zhou.After the battle, other PVA soldiers found Zhou unconscious in the snow and already suffering from frostbite. If he did not undergo surgery immediately, his life would be in danger. Due to the lack of anesthetics, the doctor wrapped his limbs with ice cubes and performed the amputation while he was in a coma with a high fever.After the surgery, the doctor said, "If he doesn't wake up within seven days, he will die."Zhou's strength helped him survive. Although he lost both his hands and legs, he didn't give up. After returning to China, he took care of his basic needs and also found the will power to practice calligraphy despite inherent difficulties.Over the past decades, Zhou completed nearly 2,000 calligraphy pieces and won many awards in various calligraphy competitions.Zhou's patriotism and perseverance have moved and inspired many Chinese netizens.A video of a veteran amputee doing calligraphy is tugging at the heartstrings of many Chinese netizens.

Ninety-three percent of film companies recorded more than 75 percent losses in the second quarter of 2020. If the status quo persists, 69 percent of small and medium-sized film companies will be forced to declare bankruptcy or close permanently, and 66 percent of theater jobs will be lost.

Also we've brought back the Zaocha æ©è¶ or Morning Tea, a must-do tradition for many locals, so visitors get an authentic taste of local delicacies."Usually at this time of the year, tourists and theater lovers would be flocking into the little town for its annual theater festival.The event has been postponed to next year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. But some still linger for Wuzhen's unique charm.One visitor said that she came here at least twice a year and the view in October is quite different from March and April.Another visitor revealed that for her Wuzhen is more than just a tourist site, it is a cultural symbol and her favorite place is this lantern shop where she could really feel the festive vibe.As Wuzhen goes into the first national week holiday amid COVID-19 pandemic, staff are taking every precaution so that visitors can have a safe and pleasant stay here."Wuzhen stands out from other tourist sites because of its high standard of management in accommodation and restoration," Yao Jie, CEO Assistant of Wuzhen Tourism Co. Ltd., told CGTN, adding "For the National Day holiday season we're implementing a series of strict anti-epidemic measures, like regular disinfection, no contact check-ins and check-outs."The newly renovated Tourist Service Center as well as some older stores will also make their debut.These upgraded faculties will not only provide a more spacious and comfortable space at the reception, but also provide tourists with more services and interactive features. Wuzhen, which reopened in April, is expecting a major increase in visitor numbers over the National Day holiday week.The old city of Beijing is lined with hutongs. They are small meandering alleyways that form a maze of siheyuan, which are single-story homes surrounded by open-air courtyards. Life in the hutong neighborhoods follows a slow pace, giving an atmosphere of days gone by. In many ways, the hutong is more than just an architectural concept. It is a way of life and a living imprint of time. Over the years, many dwellings have been falling apart and truly authentic hutongs are no longer ideal living spaces by today's standards.This is why preserving and restoring hutongs have become an important point of discussion in the urban development of Beijing. Recently, the Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center joined hands with Beijing Tian Heng Development Group to revitalize Beijing Shi Cha Hai's hutong neighbourhoods. Hu Xinyu, trustee of Beijing Cultural Heritage Protection Center (CHP), believes the collaboration between the two is "a perfect match."Hu explains that as a state-owned company, Tian Heng has the capability to acquire courtyards that need repair. And CHP, as a charity group, has the capacity to mobilize volunteers, and contribute to the design and heritage preservation measure in regenerating courtyards. Over the past eight years, Tian Heng has looked to restore 100 courtyards, 30 of which are still under construction.To conserve and protect the courtyard homes, Chen Liming, head of engineering department at Tian Heng adheres to a strict set of principles. "Fix and repair" is the mantra he follows when refurbishing courtyard homes. "Keep what's worth keeping" is also important.For one project, Chen had a new wall built from old bricks retained from the original structure before it was taken down."If we can't keep the entire structure, then we preserve at least parts of it," Chen states.Finally, "recycle what's reusable." Chen believes things like old tiles, wooden frames, and cornerstones are "time prints." Adding them back into the new house and the refurbished home will give it its own distinctive personality. For this year's Beijing Design Week, Tian Heng presented several remodeled projects to the public. Some are rooms transformed into Airbnbs, while others are courtyard homes turned into boutique hotels. These reinvented spaces encourage interaction between local residents and visitors, giving these old neighborhoods a new purpose while maintaining their historical faÃ§ade. Renovating the courtyards by redesigning them in a new light is another way architects are reviving the hutongs. Yinyuan, or the "Invisible Yard" at Bao Chao Hutong had been vacant and deserted over the past five years. But this summer, the 50 square meter courtyard home had a revolutionary makeover. Mirrored floors are used to bring the hutong skyscape into the private alley and see-through glass walls are installed to lighten up the living area. As for existing brickwork and the original wooden beams, they are left exposed across the interior to contrast the new intervention, creating a dialogue between the past and future.Over the past decade, a growing number of Chinese and international architects have been revitalizing these iconic architectures. They are exploring new possibilities for hutongs by reinventing their spaces and re-adapting their uses. But the impact these urban interventions and renovations will have on the hutongs and their rustic charm, only time will tell. The old city of Beijing is lined with hutongs.

Through a tidy array of lights, the enormous natural power is seen pushing the waves forward and pounding against riverbanks harshly, as if countless of silver dragons were vigorously swimming.Under the background of light beams near the river, viewers can savor a skillful water painting created by nature.It looks like a landscape painting on water, but on a closer look, it also looks like a flowing music score that plays grandiose symphonies.According to local authorities, the scenic area has received more than 5,000 visitors within five days by October 1. The number of daily views is estimated to reach a peak on October 4, the 18th day of the eighth month on Chinese lunar calendar, when the tidal bores reach their most spectacular moment.(Video by Hong Yaobin; Cover image by Li Jingjie)Now is the best time to admire the Tidal Bore of the Qiantang River, an annual natural spectacle, in east China's coastal city.The picturesque scene featuring magnificent tidal bores rushing under the luminous moon attracted crowds of locals and visitors in Haining City, Zhejiang Province on Thursday night.Since ancient times, the world-famous Qiantang Tidal Bore, which is created by the gravity from the moon and the rotation of the Earth, has been hailed as a "marvelous spectacle on earth."One of the world's largest tidal bores ushered in the best time of the year for sightseeing with the advent of the Mid-Autumn Festival, which fell on October 1 this year, coinciding with China's National Day.It has been a great tradition and local custom in the eastern province for over 2,000 years to enjoy the natural wonder and celebrate under the full moon around the festival, when the tidal waves become the biggest bores.The best vantage point for watching the amazing back-flow bore in Haining City made a big innovation this year to improve tourists' experience.Tourists flocking to the riversides can enjoy an unprecedented opportunity to not only hear but watch the amazing scene at night owing to the elaborately designed light beam arrays.The Qiantang Tidal Bore is also called "the Silver Dragon" by locals.

It is the first long holiday over three days since the coronavirus epidemic broke out in January.The tourism industry suffered a heavy blow during the epidemic. With the epidemic largely under control in the country, people are pinning high hopes on the holiday for a tourism boost. Preferential price stimulates tourism boomOne month before the holiday, travel agencies introduced various discounts and subsidies to attract tourists.China's top online travel platform Ctrip rolled out 1 billion yuan of subsidies for the National Day holiday on September 7, while its contender Fliggy backed by Alibaba announced a 10-billion-yuan-subsidy plan one day after. These can be used to book train tickets, hotels and scenic spot tickets.For example, if the subsidies are properly used, the ticket price for Shanghai Disney Resort can reach as low as 199 yuan compared to its normal price of 500 to 700 yuan, and the ticket price for some popular destinations, such as Beijing's Palace Museum and Guangzhou Chimelong Tourist Resort, can be halved.Scenic spots themselves have also striven to attract more visitors, with more than 500 across China exempting or reducing ticket prices. Central China's Hubei Province, which was hardly-hit by the epidemic earlier this year, opened all of its national A-level scenic spots for free to tourists from August to December 31.To further promote consumption, regional governments in collaboration with eCommerce platforms and local business owners, give out consumption vouchers.East China's Shandong Province will issue consumption vouchers valued at 20 million yuan during the holiday, which can be used on more than 340,000 cultural and tourist products. Beijing is scheduled to hand out 12.5 million vouchers in seven batches in October, among which are meal vouchers used in onsite restaurants and take-away food.Epidemic prevention measures taken to keep safetyTo meet the tourists' demand during the holiday, the Ministry of Culture and Tourism recently raised the capped number of tourists from 50 percent to 75 percent in scenic spots.The Palace Museum raised the limited number of visitors from 12,000 to 30,000 since Thursday, the most since it reopened. But visitors should book the ticket online in advance, which is a common practice in most scenic spots across the country.Tourists are also arranged to visit in staggered time. Xinhua reported that 90 percent of 280 national 5A-level scenic spots have set up the booking system for tourists to visit in batches.For open-air scenic spots, such as Chaka Salt Lake in northwest China's Qinghai Province, increased number of staff members and volunteers have been deployed to prevent large crowds gathering.China saw 108 million visits and raked in 76.5 billion yuan in tourism income on October 2, the second day of the National Day holiday, while the first day observed a total of 97 million visits with 76.7 billion yuan ($11.3 billion) in tourism income, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, raising people's expectation for a tourism boom.This year, the National Day coincided with the Mid-Autumn Festival, marking an extended holiday of eight days.

People across the country reunite with family and friends, and enjoy the charm of moon together. Some people will choose to watch Peking Opera during the festivities, classic opera "Drunken Concubine" is one of the most widely circulated ones. It is also a must-see Chinese opera for die-hard opera fans around the world.Story behind the "Drunken Concubine"Set in the Tang Dynasty (618-907), the "Drunken Concubine" tells a story of emperor's beloved concubine Yang Yuhuan, also known as one of the Four Beauties of ancient China. Its plot could be traced back to poet Bai Juyi's celebrated poem "A Song of Immortal Regret," which tells the touching love story between Emperor Xuanzong and his concubine Yang.The main character of this opera is Yang. One night she arranges a banquet in an imperial garden and waits for the emperor to come, but the emperor never turns up. Yang realizes he chose another concubine over her and feels humiliated, furious and depressed. The opera shows the change of Yang's mood and also reflects how ancient feudalism oppresses women. "The icy moon rises above the island, making the world so clear," Yang says expressing her feelings through lyrics and embeds her emotions onto the moon. As the theme of the lyrics is an ode to the moon, it's suitable to enjoy this opera during the Mid-Autumn Festival. The cultural barrier has not stopped people's love for Peking Opera. "Drunken Concubine" has been performed in many countries including Russia, Austria and North Korea.Mid-Autumn Festival meets Peking OperaYu Kuizhi and Li Shengsu are two Peking Opera masters of the China National Peking Opera Company.

Mei took the traditional Chinese art abroad in the early 20th century, impressing foreign audiences with his beautiful voice and unforgettable performances. "Peking Opera needs to be passed down from one generation to the next, and our cultural exchanges with other countries also needed to be passed down like this," Yu told CGTN. Traditional festivals give people a chance to know more about time-honored culture like the Peking Opera, and also allows people to enjoy the country's national treasures. (Cover image designed bu Xu Qianyun)The Mid-Autumn Festival falls on October 1 this year, marking one of the most important and poetic Chinese festivals.
